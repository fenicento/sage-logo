<italic>Background:</italic> Early repair of a complete common atrioventricular canal defect (CCAVCD) may benefit patients who exhibit congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. However, concern about increased risk and fragility of valve tissue has commonly led to delaying the surgical repair until the patients achieve a predetermined weight. We report our experience with a strategy of early repair independent of age or weight<italic>. Methods</italic>: Between 2003 and 2009, 32 patients underwent two-patch repair of CCAVCD at our institution; 22 patients weighed between 2.5 and 4 kg (group #1) and 10 weighed more than 4 kg (group #2). Medical records and echocardiographic studies were reviewed to determine whether there was a difference in the incidence of mortality, rate of reintervention, and complications between the two groups.<italic> Results</italic>: Operative mortality was 3.1% (1 of 32), with one additional death two years after repair, for an overall mortality of 6.25%. Median duration of mechanical ventilation, median hospital stay, and intropic score was similar between both groups. Freedom from valve reintervention was 91% in group #1 (20 of 22), and 89% in group #2 (8 of 9, p = 1.00).<italic> Conclusions</italic>: Complete common atrioventricular canal defect can be repaired safely and effectively in patients under 4 kg. Although mortality was not increased, smaller patients have a tendency for longer intensive care and hospital stay as well as a higher incidence of atrioventricular valve regurgitation. However, valve function improved during the period of follow-up and did not impact the freedom from reintervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Complete common atrioventricular canal defect (CCAVCD) is one of the congenital heart malformations most frequently diagnosed in infancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112439586">1</xref></sup> Two thirds of patients with an unrepaired defect develop significant obstructive pulmonary vascular disease by one year of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112439586">2</xref></sup> In addition, degenerative changes of the common atrioventricular (AV) valve are progressive, leading to an increased incidence of AV valve regurgitation with age. In this scenario, surgical repair is commonly undertaken before six months of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112439586">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112439586">3</xref></sup> However, due to concern regarding leaflet tissue fragility and its potential impact on valve competency, surgical repair is often delayed until a predetermined weight is reached (usually 4-5 kg), allowing the AV valve tissue to gain thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112439586">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112439586">4</xref></sup> Despite the presence of a significant hemodynamic burden, these weight criteria frequently result in a delay of surgical repair due to the inability of the patients to achieve the desired weight, in spite of the addition of aggressive enteral feeding regimens and anticongestive therapy. The goal of this study is to review our experience with early repair of CCAVCD, without a preestablished weight criterion and to report the early and mid-term outcome associated with this strategy.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-2150135112439586">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Eligible patients were identified using the Nemours Cardiac Center patient database and included all referrals for management of CCAVCD at our institution between January 2003 and December 2009. Complete electronic and paper medical records were reviewed for each patient including outpatient cardiology clinic notes. A preoperative, pre-discharge, and most recent echocardiogram was reviewed by a single senior cardiologist who was blinded to patient outcome. Ten of the 32 patients identified were followed by a cardiologist at an outside institution. Midterm follow-up data included the most recent outpatient progress notes and echocardiograms or echocardiogram reports as of June 2010. Two patients were lost to follow-up after relocation to a different geographical area.</p>
<p>Patients with unbalanced ventricles, associated tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary vein stenosis, and those with hemodynamically significant arch abnormalities were excluded from this study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nemours.</p>
<p>Mortality was the primary outcome measure, and it was divided into operative (death prior to discharge or within 30 days postoperatively), short-term (death within 2 years from original hospital discharge), and midterm (death during years 2-7 following hospital discharge). Secondary outcome measures included duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit, and hospital stay. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2150135112439586">Appendix A</xref> delineates the echocardiographic parameters used to grade the degrees of left AV valve regurgitation and residual ventricular septal defects. All repairs were performed using hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. All repairs were performed using two PTFE patches, sutured in place with running 6-0 polypropylene, to repair both the atrial and the ventricular components of the defect. Perioperative care was delivered in a dedicated cardiac intensive care unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135112439586">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The patients were divided into two groups according to their weight at the time of surgery. Group I included patients weighing 4 kg or less, and group II was composed of patients weighing more than 4 kg. Categorical variables are presented using frequencies and percentages, and quantitative variables are presented using either mean and SD, or median and range (minimum–maximum). A Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test were used for comparing the distribution of categorical variables, and two-sample <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> Test were used for comparing the mean or median of quantitative variables between two groups. A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (Version 19, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-two patients, 11 male (34%) and 21 female (66%), underwent operative repair of CCAVCD over the study period. Cohort characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150135112439586">Table 1</xref>. Twenty-eight (87.5%) of these patients  had trisomy 21. Of the 32 patients operated on, 25 (78%) had a Rastelli type A defect, 1 had a Rastelli type B, and 4 (12.5%) patients had Rastelli type C defects. Two patients underwent pulmonary artery (PA) banding in anticipation of definitive repair. One patient underwent banding prior to repair of Hirschsprung disease. The second patient who underwent PA banding presented undiagnosed at six months of age, with significant congestive heart failure, and was felt to be too unstable for a definitive repair at the time of presentation. Of the 32 patients, 2 (6.25%) had an associated left AV valve abnormality, including one patient with a tear in one of the leaflets and a second patient with a hypoplastic left AV valve inflow area, a fused left AV valve papillary muscle, and a dysplastic valve. Four other patients had associated cardiac abnormalities in addition to CCAVCD, including right PA branch stenosis, hypoplasia of the right upper pulmonary vein, mild arch hypoplasia, and a bicuspid aortic valve with anterior displacement of the infundibular septum. Fifteen patients (47%) received a valvuloplasty or cleft repair, 2 (6.25%) patients underwent annuloplasty, and 2 (6.25%) patients received both an annuloplasty and valvuloplasty. None of the patients received preoperative catecholamine or mechanical ventilatory support.</p>

<title>Primary Outcome</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150135112439586">Table 2</xref>, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality between the two groups. Operative mortality was 1 (3.1%) out of 32, while the overall mortality for the entire patient cohort was 2 (6.25%) out of 32, at a mean duration of follow-up of 49 months. The patient who died in the immediate postoperative period was a 1-month-old male, with no genetic abnormalities, born at term, who presented with congestive heart failure with failure to thrive. Echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated hypoplasia of the left portion of the common AV valve with a single papillary muscle in the left ventricle, moderate bilateral common AV valve regurgitation, extension of the ventricular septal defect into the conal septum, mild anterior malalignment of the conal septum, and a small patent ductus arteriosus. Following a two-patch repair and valvuloplasty at five weeks of age, his postoperative course was complicated by junctional ectopic tachycardia, which was followed by electromechanical dissociation requiring mechanical extracorporeal circulatory support, resulting in a severe ischemic insult to the brain. A second patient died suddenly two years after repair, presumably due to a noncardiac cause, as she was in excellent condition and without a residual cardiac lesion when seen by her cardiologist one week prior to death.</p>

<title>Secondary Outcomes</title>
<p>Secondary outcome measures included duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital stay. Although a trend toward longer ICU and hospital stays were observed among patients 4 kg or less, no statistically significant differences in these secondary outcomes were observed between groups. This trend was influenced by one patient who had a prolonged hospitalization (68 days), with an intensive care unit stay of 57 days, and a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (47 days) due to a severe endotheliopathy, and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> bacteremia with presumed endocarditis, for which he received a four-week course of antibiotics.</p>
<p>No significant differences were observed between the two groups in their need for postoperative inotropic support. Among patients weighing 4 kg or less, 14 (63.6%) out of 22 patients received inotropic support, compared with 7 out of 10 patients in the group weighing greater than four kilograms (70%, <italic>P</italic> = 1.00). In addition patients weighing four kilograms or less had an average Vasoactive Inotropic Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112439586">5</xref></sup> of 3.7, compared to an average Vasoactive Inotropic Score of 3.8 in the group weighing more than four kilograms.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112439586">Figure 1</xref>, the need for reintervention was similar for both groups, with freedom from subsequent valve repair of 91% in group I (20 out of 22), and 89% in group II (8 out of 9, <italic>P</italic> = 1.00).</p>

<p>In complete CCAVCD, a progressive left to right shunt associated with significant volume load on the right ventricle occurs as pulmonary vascular resistance falls in early infancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112439586">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112439586">2</xref></sup> A study looking at the natural history of unrepaired complete CCAVCD showed that more than half of these patients died by six months of age, with only 15% surviving until the age of two years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112439586">6</xref></sup> It has been reported that patients repaired after 6 months of life exhibit a higher incidence of pulmonary hypertensive events and a slower decline in their pulmonary vascular resistance, which may complicate the perioperative management of these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112439586">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Previous experience has demonstrated that elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and presence of AV valve regurgitation of greater than moderate degree are significant risk factors for increased mortality after surgical repair of CCAVCD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112439586">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112439586">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112439586"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112439586"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135112439586"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112439586"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135112439586"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135112439586">13</xref></sup> The presence of AV valve regurgitation preoperatively can lead to annular dilatation, making it more difficult to achieve adequate coaptation of the valve leaflets at the time of repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135112439586">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Patients with unrepaired CCAVCD often exhibit signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) by one month of age. This is often poorly controlled by medical therapy and is commonly associated with failure to thrive as well as an increased risk of respiratory infections; conditions that may lead to a further delay in the primary repair. In extreme cases, progression of the CHF may also lead to a preoperative need for inotropic support or mechanical ventilatory support, both of which have been associated with increased morbidity and operative mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135112439586">13</xref></sup> Due to the concern regarding the technical feasibility of surgical repair and AV valve function in very young and small infants, it is not infrequent to delay the operative repair, relying on temporizing medical measures, hoping that meaningful weight gain could be achieved prior to the surgery.</p>
<p>The challenge with this approach is that congestive heart failure almost always accompanies the physiologic drop in pulmonary vascular resistance, making it difficult for the patient with CCAVCD to gain weight. Further delay in the surgery may lead to worsening of CHF as well as failure to thrive. Indeed at the time of the primary repair, 18 (56.3%) of our 32 patients demonstrated poor weight gain, with operative weights below the 25th percentile for age. In addition to anticongestive therapy, patients were already receiving a high caloric density formula and nasogastric feeds overnight, in spite of which weight gain was difficult and slow. Early operative repair before achieving a pre-established weight allows elimination of the volume burden, thereby eliminating the underlying physiologic basis of failure to thrive. In addition, for those patients receiving preoperative enteral nutrition primarily through a feeding tube, earlier operative repair facilitates the ability to resume oral feeds sooner, thus enhancing the chances of appropriate development.</p>
<p>Although studies have looked at the potential benefit of one- versus two-patch repair of CCAVCD, there is no clear answer regarding which is the optimal approach. While a single-patch technique may appear simpler, concern has been raised, given the fact that the procedure often involves division and resuspension of the bridging AV valve leaflet, a process which may leave insufficient leaflet tissue to provide appropriate coaptation, given the fact that some tissues are incorporated into the suture line. In contradistinction, the two-patch repair buttresses the undivided AV valve elements between the patches, leaving more tissue available for coaptation, a feature which may be advantageous in smaller subjects On this premise, it has been our institutional preference to perform the operative repair of CCAVCD, using two PTFE patches to repair both the atrial and ventricular defects. This technique has yielded good operative and midterm results, as far out as seven years postoperatively, even in the group of patients weighing four kilograms and less.</p>
<p>Limited data on the repair of CCAVCD using a two-patch method in patients weighing less than four kilograms is available. Our institutional practice has been to routinely perform a repair based on the patients’ clinical condition; as early as 2 weeks of life, with operative weights as low as 2.5 kg. In fact, we could not identify a difference in the primary outcome (mortality at any time following surgery) after repair of a balanced CCAVCD, between patients with operative weights above or below four kilograms, leading to an overall mortality in the four kilograms or less group of 4.5% (1 out of 22) which is comparable to the operative and midterm mortality for the entire cohort of 3.1% (1 out of 32) and 6.25% (2 out of 32), respectively. This data differs from the observations reported in 2002 by Boening and colleagues who identified repair in children less than 7.6 kg as a risk factor that is associated with a negative influence on survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112439586">3</xref></sup> as well as those reported by Michielon et al who had a 13.5% mortality in the group operated on under four months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135112439586">15</xref></sup> Conversely, the results presented here are similar to the unadjusted 2.5% operative mortality reported in the STS Congenital Heart Surgery Database for this lesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135112439586">16</xref></sup> The only death that occurred in the four kilograms or less group was prior to discharge in a child with anterior displacement of the infundibular septum as well as a fused papillary muscle of the left AV valve, both of which have been shown by others to be independent risk factors for adverse outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112439586">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112439586">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to overall mortality, no significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes, including duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, postoperative arrhythmias, postoperative seizures, need for mechanical circulatory support, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, need for postoperative inotropic support, as well as the need for reintervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150135112439586">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Gunther et al reported that patients who were less than 6 months of age and weighed less than five kilogram had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean = 8.4 ± 12.3 days) compared with those patients operated on at weights greater than five kilogram (3.3 ± 4.3 days).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112439586">4</xref></sup> In addition, their study demonstrated that patients in the younger and smaller group had longer postoperative stays in the intensive care unit (12.2 ± 12.9 days) compared with the group of patients repaired at ages greater than 6 months and operative weights more than 5 kg (7.3 ± 8.8 days). In our series, patients weighing four kilogram or less had similar durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay when compared with the older group in the Gunther study, which may be a reflection of the improvement in the postoperative care of these patients in the contemporary era.</p>
<p>Despite our observation that there was not an increased risk of mortality when performing repair of CCAVCD in patients weighing four kilogram or less, echocardiographic data demonstrated a higher incidence of AV valve regurgitation of moderate or greater degree in the immediate postoperative period. Although it may be argued that this might be related to the strategy of selective cleft closure in our cohort, this figure is considerably higher than the report by Michielon et al, in which the incidence of postoperative moderate-to-severe left AVV regurgitation was 12% following repair in patients less than four months of age, compared with 27% in the group operated on at an age greater than four months using an approach which also did not include routine closure of the cleft or zone of apposition of the left AV valve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112439586">9</xref></sup> In our cohort however, this finding appeared to be transient and did not appear to have a negative impact on the ability of these patients to be weaned from mechanical ventilation and inotropic support, as well as be discharged from the hospital in a time frame that compares well with the current series and the Congenital STS database benchmark.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135112439586">16</xref></sup> In addition, although some patients required left AV valve reinterventions, the degree of AV valve regurgitation generally exhibited a significant improvement during the follow-up period.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to this study, including the retrospective nature of the study, the relatively small sample size, as well as the low incidence of adverse events, which made it impossible to perform an analysis of risk factors for death or secondary outcomes. In addition, the lack of variation in management and support strategies did not permit analysis or identification of important variables such as perfusion or ICU protocols, which may have a significant influence on outcome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this data reaffirms the concept that in the presence of clinical signs of CHF and poor weight gain, balanced CCAVCD can be repaired safely and effectively using a two-patch technique in patients with operative weights of less than 4 kg and as small as 2.5 kg. Although this data is preliminary in nature, it supports the general approach to perform the operative repair at the time of initial presentation, if failure to thrive on the basis of heart failure is present, without delaying the repair until the patient achieves a predetermined weight as recommended in earlier studies. Despite the risk of developing a greater degree of AV valve regurgitation immediately after surgery, the post operative recovery in the vast majority of patients was satisfactory, and AV valve function improved over time, as most patients achieved good functional status with a low overall rate of reinterventions.</p>

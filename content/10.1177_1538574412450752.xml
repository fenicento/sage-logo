<abstract>
<p>Introduction: It has been demonstrated that endovascular repair of arterial disease results in reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality compared to open surgical repair. The rates of complications and need for reinterventions, however, have been found to be higher than that in open repair. The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of endograft complications and mortality in patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair; specifically, our aim was to identify a subset of patients with AAA whose risk of periprocedure mortality was so high that they should not be offered endovascular repair. Methods: We undertook a prospective review of patients with AAA receiving endovascular therapy at a single institution. Collected variables included age, gender, date of procedure, indication for procedure, size of aneurysm (where applicable), type of endograft used, presence of rupture, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, major medical comorbidities, type of anesthesia (general, epidural, or local), length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and length of hospital stay. These factors were correlated with the study outcomes (overall mortality, graft complications, morbidity, and reintervention) using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 199 patients underwent endovascular AAA repair during the study period. The ICU stay, again, was significantly correlated with the primary outcomes (death and graft complications). In addition, length of hospital stay greater than 3 days, also emerged as a statistically significant predictor of graft complications in this subgroup (<italic>P</italic> = .024). Survival analysis for patients with AAA revealed that age over 85 years and ICU stay were predictive of decreased survival. Statistical analysis for other subgroups of patients (inflammatory AAA or dissection) was not performed due to the small numbers in these subgroups. Conclusions: Patients with AAA greater than 85 years of age are at a greater risk of mortality following endovascular repair. In addition, patients who are expected to require postprocedure ICU admission are also at an increased risk of mortality following endovascular repair.</p>

</sup> The specific factors associated with endovascular failure, complications, and mortality have yet to be delineated. The disparity in type of endovascular device used across different centers has complicated comparisons of data from different studies. In addition to ongoing advances in device quality, improvements in physician dexterity (as experience accumulates) with this technique have also complicated this determination. In this study, we review the experience with endovascular arterial repair at 3 different centers (University of Alberta Hospital, Royal Alexandra Hospital, and the Grey Nuns Hospital) over an 11-year period. The primary purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of overall mortality in patients undergoing elective endovascular AAA repair. We also examined the determinants of endovascular morbidity and reinterventions in this patient cohort.</p>
<sec id="section1-1538574412450752" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We undertook a review and analysis of a prospective cohort of patients receiving endovascular therapy for infrarenal AAAs at least 5.5 cm in greatest diameter. Patients underwent treatment at one of the 3 different centers in Edmonton, Canada: the University of Alberta Hospital, the Royal Alexandra Hospital, and the Grey Nuns Community Hospital. The study encompassed all patients treated for infrarenal AAAs with endovascular stenting from January 1998 to January 2009. All procedures were performed by 1 of 5 different vascular surgeons. The various variables of interest were collected from the prospectively accrued database and supplemented in each case with a thorough patient chart review. The collected variables were age, gender, date of procedure, size of aneurysm, type of endograft used, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, presence and types of major medical comorbidities, type of anesthesia (general, epidural, or local), length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay (LOS), graft complications, reinterventions for graft complications, morbidity attributed to the endovascular repair, early death, late death, and reason for death.</p>
<p>All complications attributable to the endografts were documented including all types of leaks, graft occlusion, graft thrombosis, graft migration, endotension, arterial injury, other vessel occlusion, and organ ischemia. These were strictly recorded as documented by follow-up imaging. All subsequent reinterventions were also documented including repeat stenting, conversion to open surgical repair, and thrombectomy. Morbidity attributed to the endovascular repair included periprocedural medical events (such as cardiac events and renal failure), groin complications, and limb or buttock ischemia. Early death was defined as death occurring within 30 days of the procedure. Accordingly, late death was defined as death occurring after 30 days from the date of the endovascular treatment.</p>
<sec id="section2-1538574412450752">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary outcome in this study was overall mortality. The secondary outcomes were endovascular-related morbidity and reintervention following the initial endovascular therapy. Disease-specific mortality was not assessed in this study due to the discrepancies and impreciseness of documentation of cause of death. It was difficult, in most cases, to attribute death from a cardiovascular or renal event specifically and exclusively to the endovascular procedure with any certainty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1538574412450752">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>A descriptive analysis of the potential population was done for the overall sample. Results of these analyses were tabulated using means and standard deviations for scaled variables and numbers and percentages for categorical variables. A range of demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized and compared for each outcome variable (death, graft complication, and postprocedure morbidity) using Wilcoxon tests, independent <italic>t</italic> tests, and chi-square tests as appropriate. These predictor variables were independently tested in a univariate logistic regression models and those that achieved a significance level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .1 were entered in a multivariate logistic regression. Using a combination of stepwise procedure and manual selection procedure based on clinical judgment, covariates were selected if they were significant at the .05 level. The unadjusted odds ratios and <italic>P</italic> values were shown for univariate tests and the adjusted odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval and <italic>P</italic> values for multivariate analyses. Median splits were used for continuous variables during initial modeling; however, more clinically relevant dichotomies were used instead of final modeling. By extending survival techniques in this patient population, we modeled time to event (death) while simultaneously adjusting for predictor variables. Cox proportional hazards model was preferred since there was no requirement of an underlying distributional assumption. Inspection of Kaplan-Meier plots provided a view of the effects of various covariates. Power to detect a significant difference was likewise greater when the entire event experience was modeled and analyzed. The median survival time calculated by the life table method was 7.0 years. The median follow-up time in days for the overall cohort was 309 days and 926 days for death and alive/censored patients, respectively. The follow-up time for the AAA subgroup is 1.0 year or 374 days for patients who died and 2.2 years or 810 days for “alive/censored” patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574412450752">
<title>Statistical Analyses and Interpretations for Survival Models</title>
<p>The outcomes of early death and late death had few events to analyze separately so we elected to use an overall survival analysis of the entire sample. For descriptive purposes, Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted. The assumption of proportional hazards was tested using graphical techniques and including time-dependent variables in the model. If the covariates satisfy the proportional hazard assumption, then the plot of the survival function and the survival time should have parallel lines. All covariates tested satisfied the assumption of proportional hazards. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412450752">Table 1</xref> below shows the results of the univariate Cox proportional hazards models, including 95% confidence intervals and corresponding <italic>P</italic> values. The predictors included in the multivariate cox regression were selected based on clinical and statistical reasoning. Rupture was not included because of its effect on the standard errors. The size of aneurysm was included even though it appeared as nonsignificant on univariate modeling.</p>

<p>A total of 199 patients received endovascular treatment for patients with AAA selected to undergo this treatment at the 3 different institutions in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada: the University of Alberta Hospital, the Royal Alexandra Hospital, and the Grey Nuns Community Hospital. The characteristics of the overall patient cohort are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412450752">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Overall, the rate of secondary interventions for complications following the initial endovascular repair was 6.1% in our series (14 cases). Out of these 14 cases, 10 underwent successful repeat endovascular repair, 2 underwent angioplasty for iliac artery complications, and 2 underwent open surgical repair. These figures fall well within the reported rates of 0% to 9% of secondary interventions in the literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574412450752">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most authorities agree that AAAs that are 5.5 cm in diameter or larger should be offered repair, whether it be by the open or endovascular technique. Evidence thus far shows less perioperative mortality with endovascular repair compared to open surgical repair at the expense of a higher graft complication rate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412450752">5</xref>
</sup> It may stand to reason, therefore, that patients with major medical comorbidities (that are at higher risk of death with open AAA repair) should be offered the less invasive endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) therapy; the evidence to date, however, has not born this out. The EVAR II trial randomized 330 patients deemed unfit for open repair to either receive endovascular repair or observation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412450752">6</xref>
</sup> The study demonstrated that patients receiving EVAR showed no difference in either overall or aneurysm-specific mortality compared to observation. The authors, therefore, concluded that patients with AAA who are medically unfit to undergo open surgical repair do not benefit from EVAR. Unfortunately, this landmark study did not specifically define the criteria for medical fitness to undergo open AAA repair. The determination of who was deemed unfit for open repair was left to each participating center to make that determination locally.</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed a prospectively collected database of patients that underwent endovascular AAA repair over an 11-year period. Our aim was to identify factors that could predict patient mortality and graft complications with elective EVAR therapy. Our results showed that patient age of 85 years or older and postprocedure ICU stay are significantly predictive of overall mortality in AAA patients. The need for postprocedure of ICU stay in our study significantly correlated with patient ASA class and the use of a general anesthetic. In addition, ICU stay and LOS greater than 3 days significantly correlated with endovascular graft complications. More specific criteria are needed to identify the subset of patients whose perioperative EVAR mortality would negate any benefit from this procedure. Both patient age and the need for ICU admission could be viewed as being surrogates for the patient’s physiological reserve rather than indicators of the specifics of the aortic pathology. Therefore, the results of this study concur with the growing body of evidence that such criteria need to be made based on indicators of the patient’s overall medical fitness.</p>
<p>The results of this study should not be interpreted as disparaging the utility of EVAR in older and/or sicker patients; the fact that such patients had decreased survival should not in itself limit the application of this procedure. Such patients are likely to do even worse with open surgical repair as evidenced by prior studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412450752">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412450752">4</xref>
</sup> The dilemma is how to identify patients whose periopeative EVAR risk outweighs the risk of rupture with mere observation. In a review of 22 830 patients treated for AAA, Schermerhorn et al found that the reduction in perioperative mortality with EVAR (compared to open surgery) increased with age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412450752">7</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the decrease in survival of older patients in our study would likely have been even more dramatic had they undergone open surgical repair. Patients selected to undergo treatment by EVAR are usually afflicted with a greater burden of medical comorbidites than those selected for open repair. Therefore, the reduction in mortality associated with endovascular repair is likely to be underestimated. In this study, neither the presence of major comorbid illnesses nor increased ASA class correlated significantly with either mortality or graft complications. While these results reaffirm the advantage of EVAR in patients with major medical comorbidities, they also point to the need for further stratification of patients according to the risk of periprocedure mortality. Future studies with larger numbers are needed to further stratify patients 85 years and older into those that would benefit from EVAR and those that would not. Other studies, however, have also found advanced age to be predictive of mortality in patients with AAA treated with EVAR.<sup>

<p>In conclusion, patients aged 85 years or older and those requiring postprocedure ICU stay had an increased mortality following EVAR. Further stratification of patients with AAA aged 85 years or older according to more specific medical fitness criteria may be useful in determining which patients are unlikely to benefit from EVAR.</p>

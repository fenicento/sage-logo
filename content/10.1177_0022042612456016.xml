<abstract>
<p>In China, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for substance use, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, there has been little research into their drug use and the sexual behaviors they engage in after drug and alcohol use. Using respondent-driven sampling methodology, this cross-sectional study of 404 MSM described drug use and examined sexual behaviors after drug and alcohol use among general MSM and money boys (those who engage in same-sex commercial sex) in Shanghai, China. Money boys reported using more drugs in the last week, 3 months and ever, and having sex after drinking and sex after using drugs more frequently than general MSM. It is vital to continue research and begin science-based interventions in these high-risk and underserved populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, there has been increased interest in the study of men who have sex with other men (MSM) in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456016">Guo, Li, &amp; Stanton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2009</xref>). A subpopulation of these MSM is known as <italic>money boys</italic> (an indigenous term coined by those who practice the trade). Compared with the general MSM population, these money boys tend to be younger (approximately 25 years of age) and earn a higher income, and are more likely to experience high levels of depression, use alcohol, engage in risky sexual behaviors, and contract HIV and/or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Money boys are also more likely to be internal migrants within China who, in traveling to other cities, have less access to social support and health care benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456016">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612456016">Tucker &amp; Cohen, 2011</xref>). All of these factors have an impact on public health efforts as Chinese MSM and money boys make up the largest portion of Chinese HIV/AIDS, syphilis, and HIV/syphilis coinfections, and both groups are likely to also have female sexual partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456016">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456016">Liu, Liu, Cai, Rhodes, &amp; Hong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612456016">X. Zhang et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although attention to Chinese MSM has increased, there are several research gaps that remain concerning their risky health behaviors and the motivations behind them. One common prominent idea is that there are undue social pressures on Chinese MSM, who live in a traditional culture where MSM behavior is not well understood and the expectations to produce an heir (i.e., father a son) are strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612456016">He, Wong, Huang, Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2009</xref>). This pressure has most likely been compounded by the one-child policy, because hypothetically, only a single person is available to pass on the family name. Other sociodemographic characteristics such as high levels of discrimination related to MSM behavior, being part of an out-group due to migrant status, little social support, stigma and sexual identity issues, and work obligations may lead to increased depression, tobacco, and alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612456016">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456016">Nehl, Wong, He, Huang, &amp; Zheng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612456016">Uretsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, an alarming number of general MSM and money boys in China continue sexual relationships with their wives and other women in addition to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612456016">Chow, Wilson, &amp; Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612456016">Wei, Guadamuz, Stall, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612456016">Yun et al., 2011</xref>). Whether these relationships with women are exclusive or concurrent with MSM sexual relationships, heterosexual transmission of HIV now accounts for 40% of new infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612456016">Ministry of Health of China, Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, World Health Organization, 2010</xref>). In addition, STI status, sexual networks, and mixing among Chinese MSM have led to high rates of syphilis and HIV among men and have now been targeted for use as a potential public health intervention strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456016">Choi, Ning, Gregorish, &amp; Pan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612456016">Ruan et al., 2011</xref>). Taken as a whole, these factors likely are strongly associated with drug use among Chinese MSM, their health behaviors and outcomes, and for those within their social and sexual networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456016">Choi, Hudes, &amp; Steward, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been few English-language empirical/scientific studies on illicit drug use among Chinese money boys. In a qualitative analysis of focus groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612456016">He, Wong, Huang, Thompson et al., (2007)</xref> found that money boys reported more encounters and experience with soft drugs such as ecstasy than other male migrants. Wong extended this research in 2008, finding that non-gay-identified money boys used more drugs than those who identified as gay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al. (2010)</xref> found a lifetime drug use prevalence of 12% among money boys, with 8% and 10% for hard (e.g., cocaine) and soft (e.g., ecstasy) drugs, respectively. Both types of drug use were more prevalent among money boys than comparable general male migrants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612456016">Mi, Wu, Zhang, and Zhang (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456016">Liu, Liu, et al. (2009)</xref> both confirm these high rates, finding that 44% and 21% of male sex workers, respectively, reported ever using drugs; Mi et al. reported that ecstasy was the most commonly used, while 3% had used injecting drugs. Several theories have emerged from this research, attributing this elevated level of drug use to either the stresses of sex work, cultural isolation, or discrimination due to their occupation, all of which could lead to the use of negative coping strategies such as drug use.</p>
<p>International literature consistently documents relationships between alcohol and drug use, sexual risk-taking, and the transmission of HIV and other STIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612456016">Cary et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456016">Mathers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612456016">Van Tieu &amp; Koblin, 2009</xref>). Previous studies of drug use among male migrants, MSM, registered injection drug users and those who have gone through drug treatment, and female sex workers have begun to confirm the relationship between drug use and sexual risk behavior within the Chinese context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456016">Hong &amp; Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456016">Liu, Grusky, Zhu, &amp; Li, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612456016">Ruan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612456016">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Meanwhile, similar research has been conducted examining alcohol use and sexual risk behavior both in China and internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612456016">Li, Li, &amp; Stanton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612456016">Woolf &amp; Maisto, 2009</xref>). However, money boys and general MSM in China remain understudied in both their sexual behavior after drug use and after alcohol use, are at high risk for exposure to and transmission of STIs, and remain a significant underserved population in the community and gap in the research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, illicit drug use is not widespread in the general Chinese public, with lifetime prevalence estimates ranging from 1.5% to 5.4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612456016">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456016">Hao et al., 2004</xref>). However, pocket groups such as sex workers, heavy alcohol users, and internal rural-to-urban migrants are disproportionately affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456016">Hong &amp; Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2010</xref>). These subpopulations, which also have a large burden of other diseases, are often specifically unequal targeted for “zero tolerance” governmental enforcement policies, voluntary treatment, and compulsory detoxification treatment (which can include forced physical exercise and manual labor). Although official policy has slowly evolved to include methadone treatment and harm reduction methods, there is little indication that the most commonly used tactics involving incarceration and punishment as treatment are based on any scientific or programmatic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456016">Li, Ha, Zhang, &amp; Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612456016">Wu, Sullivan, Wang, Rotheram-Borus, &amp; Detels, 2007</xref>). Predictably, enforcement efforts have proven ineffective at preventing relapse into drug use, with relapse rates exceeding 90%. These approaches also fail to reduce unprotected sexual behaviors and are often criticized for the inflexibility of their “zero tolerance” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456016">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456016">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Public health research must continue to offer alternatives based on scientific evidence that have the potential to be effective and protect health equity. Meanwhile, little research has been conducted into drug use, sexual behaviors following substance use, and their demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial correlates among MSM in China. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (a) describe drug use and (b) examine sexual behaviors after drug and alcohol use in general MSM and money boys in Shanghai, China.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0022042612456016">
<title>Study Design and Participants</title>
<p>The current study was one component in a larger research program designed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of HIV and three STIs (gonorrhea, herpes simplex II, and syphilis) and related risk factors such as drug use and social support among Chinese MSM in Shanghai. Data for the current analyses were collected between February and April 2009 through a cross-sectional survey. All protocols and the survey underwent standard and rigorous translation and back translation (Chinese-English-Chinese). To be eligible for the study, participants must have (a) self-identified as a male, (b) been aged 18 or above, (c) been able to give verbal and written (in Mandarin) consent, and (d) had sex (oral, anal, or both) with another man in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Similar to previous studies among this “hidden population” (MSM), recruitment was conducted using respondent-driven sampling (RDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456016">Heckathorn, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612456016">2002</xref>). Specifically, eight seeds were selected based on their self-identification as being either money boys (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or general (i.e., non–money boy) MSM (<italic>n</italic> = 4), <italic>hukou</italic> (legal residency status), and age (18-35). Each seed recruited up to three peers, who themselves were eligible to recruit a second wave of up to three participants, with US$10 provided to them for each participant they recruited into the study. Recruited money boy (<italic>n</italic> = 200) and general MSM (<italic>n</italic> = 204) participants were verbally informed of the nature and purpose of the study, survey procedures, the sensitive nature of the questions, confidentiality, and payment for participation (US$40 for the survey). Although US$40 is sufficient for recruitment, it does not constitute an excessive amount based on participant standards in China and is in line with comparable research efforts among these populations. Participants were also apprised of the risks and benefits (including referrals for other services needed) and the freedom to cease participation at any time without penalty. Upon agreement, they signed a consent form and were given a copy of the Research Subject’s Bill of Rights. All consent and human subject forms as well as procedures were reviewed by appropriate academic institutional review boards in the United States and China. All participants agreed to take part in the study without any expressed reservations.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0022042612456016">
<title>Sociodemographic characteristics</title>
<p>Participants were asked to report their date of birth, present legal residency status or <italic>hukou</italic> (Shanghai vs. other), ethnicity (Han [the dominant ethnic group] vs. other), education level, and monthly income in Yuan (~US$1 = 6.8 Yuan at the time of the study). They were also asked to disclose their current marital status and sexual orientation. Finally, money boys were asked if they had ever received drugs from their clients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022042612456016">
<title>Drug use</title>
<p>Use of any drugs <italic>and</italic> four specific types of drugs were assessed: stimulants or poppers, ecstasy, heroin or white powder, and ice/methamphetamine. Methamphetamine use was measured separately from stimulant use due to linguistic conventions categorizing ice as a drug distinct from general stimulants. Participants also reported their drug use frequency in the last week as “About __ per day on average” and use per day in the past 3 months as “About __ times per day on average.” Responses were recoded into dichotomous categories across types to provide results for overall drug use and specific drug type use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022042612456016">
<title>Sexual behaviors after substance use</title>
<p>Sexual behaviors after substance use were assessed using four items derived from the public health literature to represent behaviors that have been found to increase the possibility of transmitting or receiving STIs. Participants were asked about their lifetime sexual practices: (a) Have you ever had sex after drinking? (b) Have you ever had sex without a condom because you were under the influence of alcohol? (c) Have you ever had sex after using drugs? and (d) Have you ever had sex without a condom because you were under the influence of drugs? Responses were coded as dichotomous (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>), analyzed separately, and then added to create a clustered sum score (0-4), so that higher scores indicated that a participant had engaged in a greater number of sexual practices under the influence of alcohol and drugs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022042612456016">
<title>General alcohol use</title>
<p>Six types of alcoholic drinks were assessed: beer, Chinese yellow wine, Chinese white wine, Western white wine, Western red wine, and other Western hard liquors (such as brandy, whiskey, or vodka). Participants reported their per-day frequency of drinking each type of alcohol in the past 3 months as “About __ bottles/cans per day on average,” which were computed into the number of drinks across type.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022042612456016">
<title>Depression</title>
<p>A modified, short-form version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-12) was used to screen for depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456016">Radloff, 1977</xref>). The CES-D short-form consists of 12 self-reported items related to the number of days during the past week during which the participant experienced emotional or behavioral difficulty. The CESD-12’s reliability among this sample was found to be acceptable overall (Cronbach’s α = .85) and for both participant groups (money boy Cronbach’s α for money boys = .83, Cronbach’s α for general MSM = .83).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022042612456016">
<title>Social provisions</title>
<p>Social provisions were assessed using the Weiss Social Provisions Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612456016">Weiss, 1974</xref>). The six provisions are guidance, reliable alliance, reassurance of worth, attachment, social integration, and opportunity for nurturance. Participants were asked to frame their responses based on current relationships using a 4-point scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (4) strongly agree. A global score was calculated, with increasing scores indicating higher levels of social provisions. Reliability in the sample was found to be acceptable overall (Cronbach’s α = .84) and for both participant groups (Cronbach’s α for money boys = .82, Cronbach’s α for general MSM = .85).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022042612456016">
<title>Attitudes toward sex</title>
<p>Sexual attitudes were assessed using 23 items from the Sexual Attitudes Scale (SAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612456016">Hendrick &amp; Hendrick, 1987</xref>). Items included statements such as the following: (a) “I do not need to be committed to have sex” and (b) “Sex is best when you let yourself go and focus on your own pleasure.” Participants were instructed to frame their responses based on their current partner, their most recent partner, or what they thought their response would be (if they never had a partner). Response options were modified from the original 5-point scale into a 7-point scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. Responses to the items were reverse coded and summed to create an overall score, with lower being generally more sexually permissive and open about sexuality. Reliability was found to be acceptable overall (Cronbach’s α = .79) and for both participant groups (Cronbach’s α for money boys = .85, Cronbach’s α for general MSM = .81).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022042612456016">
<title>Gay identity</title>
<p>Gay identity was assessed using 18 items from the Lesbian and Gay Identity Scale (LGBIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612456016">Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2000</xref>). This scale was developed to assess unique aspects of the gay experience related to identity and disclosure including statements such as the following: (a) “I prefer to keep my same-sex romantic relationships private” and (b) “I will never be able to accept my sexual orientation until all of the people in my life have accepted me.” Items were rated on a 7-point scale from (1) disagree strongly to (7) agree strongly and were averaged for an overall LGBIS score. Reliability was found to be acceptable overall (Cronbach’s α = .62) and for both participant groups (Cronbach’s α for money boys = .60, Cronbach’s α for general MSM = .64).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-0022042612456016">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The primary aims of this study were to (a) describe drug use and (b) examine sexual behaviors after drug and alcohol use among general MSM and money boys in Shanghai, China. First, descriptive statistics were used to characterize personal demographic traits, drug use, and substance use before sex patterns in the sample. Second, RDS recruitment was assessed for the personal demographic variables considered during the selection of recruitment seeds (money boys or general MSM, <italic>hukou</italic>, and age). Similar to comparable research, demographic characteristics found to be related to the likelihood of participating were included, but not weighted, in the main analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612456016">Ramirez-Valles, Garcia, Campbell, Diaz, &amp; Heckathorn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612456016">Winship &amp; Radbill, 1994</xref>). Third, one-way ANOVAs—with participant type (general MSM or money boy) as the between-subjects factor for continuous variables and chi-squares for categorical variables—were used to compare participant groups. Similar analyses were conducted to explore the associations between drug use and substance use before sex, demographic traits, and psychosocial scales. Last, sequential ordinal regression was conducted to determine factors associated with increasing levels of substance use before sex with forced entry of predictors into the model.</p>

<p>Among the 404 participants, the average age was 29.6 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.4), 96.0% were of Han ethnicity, 20.3% reported Shanghai to be their hometown (<italic>hukou</italic>), 76.8% had a high school education or less, 15% were married, only 12.1% were openly gay or bisexual, and 38.1% had had both male and female sexual partners in the past year (42.5% of money boys vs. 33.8% of general MSM). Nineteen percent of money boys had received drugs from their clients. Participants were most likely to have been recruited into the study by a friend (71.4%), followed by a coworker (21.6%), friend/coworker (4.0%), or lover/partner (3.0%). The reported size of one’s social network averaged 16.2 people among money boys and 13.1 people among general MSM.</p>
<p>RDSAT, a statistical program for RDS, provided estimates of homophily (the tendency to associate with those similar to self) and heterophily (the tendency to associate with those dissimilar to self). These values were examined to explore patterns of recruitment resulting from the RDS methodology (e.g., seeds are theoretically more likely to recruit participants similar to themselves; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456016">Heckathorn, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612456016">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612456016">Volz, Wejnert, Degani, &amp; Heckathorn, 2007</xref>). Money boys (Aww = 0.967) and general MSM (Homophily index = 0.955) exhibited high recruitment homophily and heterophily as nearly 97% of money boys recruited other money boys and more than 95% of general MSM recruited fellow general MSM. Only seven participants were cross-group-recruited and drug use was found not to be strongly related to recruitment. Based on these results, in-group analyses for money boys and general MSM on the other selection criteria were conducted to determine patterns of recruitment within each group. Results showed far less in-group recruitment based on other demographic traits, suggesting that self-identification as a money boy or general MSM was the driving factor in recruitment.</p>
<p>One-way ANOVAs and chi-square analyses were performed to test for demographic differences between general MSM and money boys. Although assumed to be separate groups based on occupation and recruitment patterns, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612456016">Table 1</xref> shows that money boys were also younger, had their first sexual experience with a male at an earlier age, and were more likely to be a migrant to Shanghai, of a minority ethnicity, and unmarried. Money boys were also found to be less educated but were also less likely to have their sexual orientation closeted and tended to make more money than their general MSM counterparts. Follow-up correlations to determine predictors to be entered into our final analyses revealed that age, age at first male sexual experience, marital status, monthly income, and participant type (money boy vs. general MSM) were significantly correlated to lifetime drug use. Finally, although money boys exhibited higher CES-D scores, held more open attitudes about sex, and reported greater sexual risks, none of these were significantly correlated with lifetime drug use.</p>

<title>Drug Use</title>
<p>One of the primary aims of this study was to describe drug use among the sample. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612456016">Table 2</xref>, 21.0% of participants reported ever using drugs in their lifetime. The most commonly used drug was ice/methamphetamine (9.4%), followed by ecstasy (7.9%), stimulants (7.0%), and heroin (0.7%). Money boys were found to be statistically more likely to have ever used drugs (31.5% vs. 10.8%), used drugs within the past 3 months (16.6% vs. 2.9%), and used drugs in the past week (7% vs. 1.5%) relative to general MSM. Money boys also reported greater lifetime use of stimulants (10.7% vs. 3.4%) and ice/methamphetamine (15.6% vs. 3.4%) and greater use of ice within the past 3 months (9.1% vs. 1.0%). They also were marginally more likely to use ice in the past week (4.0% vs. 1.0%). Ice/methamphetamine was the drug-of-choice among money boys. Overall, heroin use was scarce regardless of time period concerned (lifetime, 3 months, or in the past week). Lifetime use of ecstasy and heroin was relatively equal for money boys and general MSM.</p>

<title>Sex After Substance Use</title>
<p>The second aim of the study was to examine sexual behaviors after substance use among the sample. Categorizing participants into an index of participants who engaged in sex after substance use, we found that 42.1% engaged in one or two practices and 5.4% engaged in three or four practices, while 52.5% reported not engaging in any sex after using alcohol or drugs. Money boys (66.0%) were less likely than general MSM (39.2%) to have engaged in sex after substance use. A large percentage of participants (45.5%) reported having sex after drinking alcohol, 30.8% reported having unprotected sex while under the influence of alcohol, 8.9% reported having sex after using drugs, and 5.0% reported having sex without a condom while under the influence of drugs. Engaging in unprotected sex after drinking alcohol or using drugs was more common, but not statistically significant, among money boys. However, money boys were also more likely to engage in sex after drinking alcohol (53.0% vs. 38.2%) and after using drugs (13.0% vs. 4.9%).</p>

<title>Multivariate Analysis</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612456016">Table 3</xref> shows results from sequential logistic regressions comparing drug use to participant type (MSM or money boy), monthly income, age, and age at first male sexual experience. The prevalence of lifetime drug use was 2.35 times greater among money boys than among general MSM. Participants who earned up to 2,999 Yuan per month had a 0.27 times lower odds of lifetime drug use and participants who earned from 3,000 to 4,999 Yuan per month had a 0.44 times lower odds of lifetime drug use relative to participants who earned 5,000 Yuan or greater per month. For each unit increase in current age, the odds of lifetime drug use among participants decreased by a factor of 0.95. Lifetime drug use decreased by a factor of 0.93 for each unit increase in age at first male sexual experience. Money boys were also 4.16 times more likely to have ever used methamphetamine, though greater income appeared to have a protective effect. Participants who earned up to 2,999 Yuan per month had a 0.27 times lower odds of lifetime methamphetamine use and participants who earned from 3,000 to 4,999 Yuan per month had a 0.34 times lower odds of lifetime methamphetamine use. The effect of participant type (MSM or money boy) on lifetime heroin use could not be determined, as there were only three participants (all of whom were general MSM) who reported lifetime heroin use.</p>

Converting the estimates to odds ratios (ORs), participants who were either money boys (OR = 1.90) or older (OR = 1.03) faced increased odds of engaging in sexual behaviors after alcohol or substance abuse. Those who exhibited depressive symptoms (OR = 1.06), more permissive attitudes about sexuality (OR = 0.98), and fewer difficulties related to their sexual orientation (OR = 0.69) also faced increased odds of engaging in sexual behaviors after alcohol or substance abuse.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary aims of this study were to describe drug use and examine sexual behaviors after drug and alcohol use among general MSM and money boys in Shanghai, China. We also aimed to explore demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial correlates of sex after alcohol and drug use. These questions were posed to a sample of participants who were recruited using RDS, an appropriate and accepted methodology for sampling hard-to-reach and marginalized groups in domestic and international research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612456016">He, Wong, Huang, Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612456016">Ramirez-Valles et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>First, the results predictably found that drug use is more prevalent among Chinese general MSM and money boys than among the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612456016">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456016">Hao et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the prevalence of drug use among money boys was reported to be nearly double that of general MSM (ever, in the past 3 months, and in the past week) and somewhat higher than has previously been reported among money boys in Shanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2010</xref>). This finding was not unexpected due to broad trends toward more drug availability and use in China and is similar to numbers coming from samples of male sex workers in Beijing/Qingdao City (44% had ever used drugs) and Shenzhen (21% had ever used drugs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612456016">Liu, Liu, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612456016">Mi et al., 2007</xref>). Similar to a study of club drug users in Shanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612456016">Yang &amp; Xia, 2010</xref>), our study found that ice/methamphetamine was the most commonly used drug (ever, within the past 3 months, and in the past week), followed by ecstasy and other stimulants; money boys consistently were more likely to have used in all categories. Lifetime heroin use was low and virtually nonexistent in the last 3 months and last week.</p>
<p>Similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al. (2010)</xref>, greater monthly income appeared to increase the odds of a participant engaging in lifetime drug use. Conversely, greater current age and greater age at first male sexual experience seemed to provide a protective effect. However, we note that it is likely an artifact of the relationships among income, age, and age at first male sexual experience with being a money boy. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612456016">Table 1</xref>, money boys tended to earn more income, be younger, and initiate sexual contact with other men at an earlier age compared with general MSM. Similar trends are apparent in regards to lifetime methamphetamine use; the relationship between greater income and increased odds of methamphetamine use most likely reflects income differences between money boys and general MSM. Depression, social provisions, attitudes toward sex, and gay identity were not shown to be significantly associated with drug use among the participants.</p>
<p>Another main aim of this study was to explore sexual behaviors after drug and alcohol use. Predictably, we found sexual behaviors after substance use to be higher among money boys across the four behaviors measured. Our data also suggest that drug/alcohol use and depression are important correlates of sexual risk behaviors among all general MSM and especially among money boys. These findings are generally in line with the international literature on the topic and a recent review of sexual behaviors after alcohol use in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612456016">Cary et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612456016">Li, Li, &amp; Stanton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456016">Mathers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612456016">Van Tieu &amp; Koblin, 2009</xref>). They also closely resonate with a recent study examining club drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612456016">Yang &amp; Xia, 2010</xref>) and earlier work of Wong et al. with Chinese male migrants in Shanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2010</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al. (2010)</xref>, the increased risky sexual behaviors and relations to drug and alcohol use among money boys is likely related to their profession and the environment that these men live and work in which encourages risky behaviors and provides ready access to alcohol and drugs.</p>
<p>One surprising set of findings from this study was that the individual-level constructs of depression, sexual attitudes, gay identity, and social provisions were not predictive of lifetime drug use. Previous research had shown these factors to be pertinent to substance use behaviors among Chinese MSM in Shanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612456016">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456016">Nehl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2010</xref>). It is quite possible that these may be predictors of more temporal drug use, but the low rates of drug use in the past week and 3 months current study did not permit these analyses. Other factors that were not measured in this study that could have been included that are those that examine higher levels of Chinese culture in relation to drug use. For instance, a growing body of research suggests that China’s collectivist culture wields an influence on condom use, feelings of stigma, and network norms among MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456016">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612456016">Liu, Feng, et al., 2009</xref>). Other research has documented the influence of Chinese collectivist culture on drug use among Chinese adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612456016">Liu, Lu, Liu, &amp; Zhang, 2010</xref>). Chinese collectivism would say that because drug use has adverse social and family outcomes, the individual should act in a way that preserves society (e.g., not use drugs). However, this would also hypothetically apply to MSM behaviors, which all of the current sample identified as engaging in. This duality of individual behavior in this group may in part explain the drug use rates found in this study being higher than that of the general Chinese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612456016">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456016">Hao et al., 2004</xref>). Although we only measured intrapersonal and interpersonal level constructs, there is evidence that collectivism is a factor worthy of future study.</p>
<p>The present study provides important and novel information concerning drug use and sexual behaviors after substance use among Chinese MSM, as such research is currently very limited. Our findings reveal higher rates of drug use and risky sexual behaviors after drug and alcohol use among Chinese money boys as well as higher prevalence of alcohol use among MSM. Chinese MSM are of particular concern due to their potential role as a bridge population for HIV/STI transmission to their female partners. Research has shown that bisexual Chinese men are more likely to acquire HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612456016">Yun et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, they are more likely to have multiple sex partners as MSM behavior is stigmatized in Chinese society, which encourages hidden and short-term relationships. Thus, this study provides vital information concerning the prevalence of drug use among an underserved population that is at high risk for STIs and has only recently begun to gain attention in public health research.</p>
<p>Despite the promising findings presented here, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, this study relied on self-reported behaviors, which no doubt yielded some bias in the results. Future studies should attempt to use objective and multiple measures of behavior when possible. Second, this study was based on data gathered in Shanghai, a city of roughly 19 million people. It is likely that the dynamics of substance use vary greatly across China due to the diversity both within society and across different MSM communities (e.g., nascent vs. well established) in China. Therefore, future studies should be extended to other settings such as rural and smaller city settings. Third, the social network analysis in this study was limited to RDS recruitment questions (e.g., size of the network) and linkages among study participants, and resulted in largely homogeneous recruitment groups. Related to this, a fourth limitation is that the current analyses do not separate social and sexual networks, which may be related to drug use and sex after substance use. Future efforts should consider a more diverse selection of recruitment seeds, the interconnections within networks, and the different types of relationships within a network. Finally, the study’s cross-sectional approach was appropriate given its exploratory nature. Future studies should include repeated measurements to predict substance use behavior over time.</p>
<sec id="section20-0022042612456016">
<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>Despite the study’s limitations, our results indicate that drug use is relatively high among Chinese money boys and, to a lesser extent, among general MSM. This finding underscores the need for additional research into public health drug prevention/intervention among these STI high-risk and disadvantaged populations. As noted above, public health professionals in China must be able to provide appropriate treatment programs that are based on scientific data. Tailoring drug use prevention and sexual behavior education programs to effectively account for the environmental, professional and psychosocial realities of everyday life of men who sell sex to other men is an essential first step.</p>
<p>We also found that sexual behaviors after drug and alcohol use were common among both money boys and general MSM. Sexual contact among MSM is currently the primary means of HIV and syphilis transmission in China and MSM make up the largest percentage of those who are responsible for both types of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612456016">Z. Q. Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612456016">Wong et al., 2009</xref>), which has led to consistent calls for increased individual screenings and surveillance among MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612456016">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). However, MSM are also very unlikely to use condoms with their male or female partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456016">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456016">Lau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612456016">Wei et al., 2009</xref>). Given that both general MSM and money boys often are married and/or have concurrent sexual relationships with women, the potential for “bridging” transmission is quite high. These findings highlight the importance of considering the influences of multiple health behaviors and situations within the same study. Clearly, the interrelated concepts of substance use, sexual risk behaviors, multiple sexual partnerships, and health outcomes remain significant public health concepts in China. Researchers and public health officials must recognize that effective prevention programs must address all of these elements simultaneously in order for interventions to work effectively.</p>

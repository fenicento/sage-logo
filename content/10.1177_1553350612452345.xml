<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has become a mainstream procedure over the past 2 decades. The advantages of laparoscopic surgery over conventional open procedures include a smaller wound size and faster recovery.</p>
<p>Recently, natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been introduced. This approach further reduces surgical invasiveness. Whiteford et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612452345">1</xref></sup> have reported on transrectal rectosigmoid resection using the transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) platform on human cadaver model. Sylla et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612452345">2</xref></sup> evaluated the feasibility of NOTES for rectosigmoidectomy using TEM with or without transgastric endoscopic assistance in swine nonsurvival and survival models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612452345">3</xref></sup> In addition, Sylla et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612452345">4</xref></sup> have reported on the first clinical case of a NOTES transanal resection for rectal cancer using TEM and laparoscopic assistance.</p>
<p>Single access surgery is another emerging technique that can reduce surgical invasiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612452345">5</xref></sup> This approach has been facilitated by the development of new single ports. Atallah et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612452345">6</xref></sup> reported that transanal minimally invasive surgery can be effective for resection of both malignant and benign lesions of the rectum using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port (SILS port, Covidien, Mansfield, MA). The port is introduced into the anal canal by applying steady manual pressure with standard laparoscopic instruments, including graspers, thermal energy devices, and needle drives.</p>
<p>The present study evaluated the feasibility of NOTES transanal rectosigmoidectomy using a single port in a swine model. The main objective of the study was to determine the length of rectosigmoid colon that could be mobilized and resected using a pure transanal approach with a single port. A secondary aim was to evaluate survival, surgery time, postoperative outcomes, and necropsy findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1553350612452345" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Animal experiments were performed in the Preclinical Animal Laboratory of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Korea. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IACUC No. BA1001-003/055-01). A nonsurvival study was conducted in 4 animals to master the technique. A survival study was performed in another 6 animals. In the latter study, the pigs were survived for 7 days postoperatively, after which they were euthanized and underwent a necropsy.</p>
<sec id="section3-1553350612452345">
<title>Animals and Preparation</title>
<p>Healthy Landrace male swine (weight range = 38-52 kg) were used for the procedures. The swine were fed Newcare (Daesang Wellife, Seoul, Korea) on preoperative day 2 and water only on preoperative day 1, and fasted overnight before procedures. Animals received polyethylene glycol (4 liters) for bowel preparation on preoperative day 1. General anesthesia was induced with Telazol/xylazine (5 + 2 mg/kg intramuscularly), and animals were intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (1.5% to 3.0%) and oxygen (3.0 L/min). In the survival study, animals received 30 mg/kg intravenous cefazolin before the operation. Tap-water enemas were administered through a rigid proctosigmoidoscope until all residual fecal material was evacuated, after which the rectum was irrigated using 500 mL diluted betadine solution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612452345">
<title>Transanal Rectosigmoidectomy</title>
<p>The rectum was occluded transanally with a purse-string suture using 2.0 vicryl approximately 4.5 to 5.0 cm from the anal verge using an anoscope. A SILS port (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) was then positioned via a transanal approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612452345">Figure 1</xref>). Low-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> was insufflated, and the rectal mucosa was scored circumferentially, starting immediately distal to the purse-string suture, using an Harmonic ACE (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Cincinnati, OH) and the 5-mm, 30° laparoscope (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI), peranally. Full-thickness rectal dissection was performed circumferentially. Posteriorly, the presacral plane was entered, and posterior dissection proceeded cephalad in the avascular presacral plane. Dissection was extended medially, laterally, and anteriorly, with care taken to stay near the rectal wall to avoid injury to adjacent structures. Circumferential rectosigmoid mobilization was extended as far cephalad as possible until it was limited by exposure. Straight or articulated laparoscopic instruments (Roticulator, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) were used for traction of the bowel. The peritoneal reflection was divided anteriorly, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. To obtain an optimal view of the intraperitoneal phase, a 5-mm trocar was inserted at the middle of the abdomen, just above the urethral orifice or 2 cm away from the urethral orifice to the right side. The laparoscope was moved to that trocar, and a gastroscope (9.0 mm in diameter, Pentax Medical Inc, Montvale, NJ) was then through the SILS port. Under transabdominal laparoscopic visualization, further mobilization was performed with a gastroscope and endoscopic needle knife. At that time, an additional mini-grasper (MiniLap Bowel Grasper, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) was used for traction of the bladder and bowel in one case. For the first 6 cases (4 nonsurvival and 2 survival), the inferior mesenteric vessels were ligated and cut using an ETS Endocutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc, Cincinnati, OH) through the SILS port. For the last 4 cases, the inferior mesenteric vessels were preserved.</p>

</fig>
<p>When dissection could not be extended any further cephalad, the SILS port was removed, and the specimen was exteriorized in preparation for transection and anastomosis. The anvil of a #29 circular intraluminal stapler (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc, Cincinnati, OH) was inserted into the proximal segment and secured using a 2.0 Prolene purse-string suture. Another purse-string suture was placed transanally on the distal rectal cuff using an anoscope and 2.0 Prolene. The anvil on the proximal colon was pulled into the distal rectal ring, and the distal purse-string suture was tied around it. The stapler was introduced through the rectal stump, connected to the anvil, closed, and fired under direct view through the anoscope. All anastomoses were inspected using a colonoscope. Intraoperative variables were recorded, including surgery time, procedural complications, length of rectosigmoid colon mobilized, and integrity of the specimen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350612452345">
<title>Postoperative Care and Necropsy</title>
<p>For the survival study, animals were monitored postoperatively by veterinary staff and surgeons for ambulation, survival, weight, oral intake, and activity. All animals were given regular food immediately after the procedures. Intravenous antibiotics (25 mg/kg/24 h via intramuscular injection) were administered for 2 days postoperatively. Necropsies were performed on postoperative day 7. Any abnormal findings were recorded. Peritoneal fluid was aspirated and analyzed for cells. The coloanal anastomosis was resected en bloc for gross evaluation. Measurements (weight) and clinical observations (eg, oral intake and activity) were made by veterinary technicians.</p>

<title>Operative Results</title>
<p>A total of 10 animals underwent NOTES transanal rectosigmoidectomy using a SILS port. Full-thickness circumferential rectosigmoid mobilization was achieved in all cases with no major intraoperative complications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612452345">Table 1</xref>). In all animals, the peritoneal reflection was reached and partially divided anteriorly, and the peritoneal cavity was entered with establishment of a CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum. Under the transabdominal laparoscopic view through the abdomen trocar, endoscopic mobilization of the lateral attachments of the rectosigmoid was performed using the needle-knife with no significant complications. Minor bleeding was noted during endoscopic dissection, and was easily controlled using cautery. The bladder was not decompressed during the procedure in any of the animals. The mean length of transanally mobilized rectosigmoid colon was 15 cm (range = 12-16 cm). The average length of resected colon was 10 cm (range = 8-15 cm). The mean operative time, which included transanal and endoscopic rectosigmoid mobilization, and staple anastomosis, was 213 minutes. In one case, the staple anastomosis failed, so a hand-sewn colo-anal anastomosis was performed. Colorectal anastomoses were completed in all animals, and no anastomotic defects were noted in any case. All resected rectosigmoid specimens were grossly intact with respect to integrity of the colonic wall, attached mesentery, and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612452345">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Postoperative Complications and Necropsy</title>
<p>Six animals were survived for 7 days. No mortality or significant postoperative complications occurred in the survival group over the postoperative period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350612452345">Table 2</xref>). All animals thrived, and the average weight gain was 0.79 kg (range = −1.5 to 1.6 kg). Two animals had a slight decrease in oral intake early in the postoperative period. At necropsy, a small amount of clear ascites was noted in all animals. In one case, formation of a small abscess was noted in the pelvic cavity<underline>, just</underline> above the anastomosis. In 3 cases, bladder distention was noted. At gross inspection, colorectal anastomoses were located an average of 3.7 cm from the anal verge (range = 3.0-4.5 cm), and all were healed. In 2 cases, there was evidence of mucosal ischemic change above the colo-anal anastomosis, which appeared to be associated with the use of inferior mesenteric vessel ligation and cutting. Neither animal with ischemic change showed any symptoms during the postoperative period.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Transanal rectosigmoidectomy was introduced for Hirschsprung’s disease in pediatric patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612452345">7</xref></sup> Recent developments have now seen the use of TEM for transanal rectal dissection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612452345">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612452345"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612452345">3</xref></sup> However, TEM has limitations for transanal approaches in swine in that mobilization is limited by the narrow size of the swine pelvis, and there is difficulty negotiating the acute angle at the sacral promontory with the short and rigid dissecting instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612452345">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612452345">9</xref></sup> To overcome these limitations of TEM, transgastric approach technique of flexible gastroscopy with TEM was attempted, but it showed high postoperative complication rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612452345">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612452345">10</xref></sup> Transanal rectosigmoidectomy using a single port can have some benefits in terms of simplicity and availability compared with TEM rectosigmoidectomy.</p>
<p>In the present study using the single port, we had no difficulties with the SILS device in terms of positioning to the anal canal and maintaining pneumorectum. However, the integrity of the seal was slightly compromised when moderate torque was used to achieve good working angles during resection. The use of articulating laparoscopic instruments helped minimize this problem. As previously described, we found placement of temporary sutures to secure the SILS port to the perianal skin was helpful in keeping the device properly seated. Most important, using the single port enabled a transanal approach with an endoscope. The SILS port provided the 3 channels for trocar insertion, and this channel allowed a 12-mm laparoscopic trocar for the flexible gastroscope. The flexible endoscope permitted dissection of the peritoneal reflection and lateral attachment of the sigmoid colon, and provided better intraperitoneal visualization than TEM did.</p>
<p>In the current study, the rate of anastomotic defects or failures requiring repair was 10% (n = 1). This was similar to the findings in TEM rectosigmoidectomy study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612452345">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612452345">3</xref></sup> Anastomotic failure was related to technical difficulties in placing the distal purse-string suture 3.0 to 4.5 cm from the anal verge in preparation for stapled anastomosis. In the one case where the stapled anastomosis failed, a hand-sewn anastomosis was performed successfully. All anastomoses were grossly healed.</p>
<p>The present study showed that full-thickness rectosigmoid dissection with complete resection of the colon, rectum, mesentery, and attached lymph nodes can be achieved. Compared with conventional or laparoscopic surgery in swine model, the number of retrieved lymph nodes was similar or better.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612452345">11</xref></sup> These findings may have significant clinical implications in terms of resection of benign lesions of the rectum and sigmoid colon as well as rectal cancers, in which total mesorectal excision is required. Three animals were found to have urinary distention. We presumed that it could be related to nerve injury, because transanal peritoneal dissection through the SILS port was not easy because of the narrow swine pelvis. This is a potentially serious complication. Further development of endoscopic devices to permit safe ligation of mesenteric vessels, and further development of flexible devices to perform more proximal colon mobilization, will increase the length of rectosigmoid colon that can be resected.</p>
<p>In the current study, we used a 5-mm abdominal trocar to obtain laparoscopic visualization. Although the pelvic dissection could be done under direct visualization using a laparoscopic camera through the anus, it was still difficult to mobilize the proximal colon because a stiff laparoscopic camera could not be reached to the proximal colon through the long and narrow pelvis. To overcome these limitations, we had tried to use transgastric assistance in the previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612452345">8</xref></sup> However, the result was disappointing because of high complication rate related to the gastrotomy. The use of a flexible endoscope through the anus should be helpful in our experiences. Although we used a 5-mm abdominal trocar to obtain laparoscopic visualization in the current study, it can be omitted by the accumulated experience of dissection using a flexible endoscope through the anus.</p>
<p>In the current study, ischemic changes in colon mucosa were noted in 2 cases, which involved inferior mesenteric vessel ligation and cutting using the laparoscopic stapler. The ischemia may have been because of the fact that swine have fewer colonic mesenteric collateral arcades. This prompted us to subsequently alter the surgical procedure to preserve the inferior mesenteric vessels using dissection along the colonic wall. In humans, the inferior mesenteric artery is commonly ligated during anterior resection for rectal or sigmoid colon cancer because there are ample mesenteric collateral vessels along the colon. Although the swine model is the most popular for developing new surgical techniques or instruments, several procedures such as inferior mesenteric artery dissection and ligation cannot be replicated in this model. Therefore, human cadaver experiments should be performed before applying this new technique in clinical trials.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that NOTES transanal rectosigmoidectomy using the SILS port is feasible and associated with a low morbidity rate in a swine model. These data indicate that further experimental studies are warranted, especially in human cadaver models.</p>

<p>This research work looks at methods for controlling a two-phase distillation column system. The present system consists of a vertical column with a number of trays used for component separation. It also has a reboiler and a condenser; these are used to provide heating and cooling for vaporization and condensation, respectively. The proposed control scheme uses the model-based predictive control (MBPC) scheme with the internal model being produced by a set of Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) fuzzy-based models. The internal set of TSK fuzzy-based models are developed from a linear models predictive approach. That is, it makes a prediction of the present system using a set of TSK fuzzy-based models identified, at each instant of time. The control scheme is then evaluated using simulation and compared with a benchmark fuzzy-based PI control scheme. The novelty of the present research is to propose a new organization in system modeling and its control scheme by combining the MBPC scheme and artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques for the purpose of improving the system performance results.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A two-phase distillation column system consists of a vertical column with a number of trays in association with a reboiler and a condenser for the purpose of providing component separation in both academic and real domains. The reboiler and the condenser are organized to provide the heat for appropriate vaporization from the bottom of the column and to provide the cooling for appropriate liquidization from the top of the column, respectively. In order to hold the condensed vapor to recycle liquid reflux from the top of the column, a reflux drum is also realized in this system. The present distillation column system may be organized based on a number of inputs flows including feed rate (liquid), boil-up flow (vapor), and reflux flow (liquid), respectively. A number of parameters including distillate bottom product flow rate and distillate top product flow rate are also taken as system outputs. Hereinafter, two-product compositions have to be dealt with through appropriate control schemes, i.e. the distillate product composition and the bottom product composition. In fact, these compositions require an efficient control algorithm to be dealt with at each instance of time.</p>
<p>Regarding the present system, a number of publications are available in which this system, in its general form, has been taken into consideration as a controlled process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0142331211417279">Skogestad and Morari 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142331211417279">Skogestad 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142331211417279">Kano et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142331211417279">Rueda et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142331211417279">Savkovic-Stevanovic 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142331211417279">Nagy et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142331211417279">Chen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142331211417279">Guo et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142331211417279">Minh and Muhamad 2010</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142331211417279">Skogestad (1997)</xref> proposed a <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0142331211417279"><mml:math display="inline" id="math1-0142331211417279"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>LV</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> -configuration control for a high-purity distillation column, where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142331211417279">Minh and Muhamad (2010)</xref> used the MBPC scheme for controlling a condensate distillation column, as well.

(2009)</xref> that the distillation column needs to be represented using mathematical relations from which the various control strategies described may be realized. The present MBPC could be used to control a distillation column system. A particularly attractive control, in the MBPC family, is now known as the LGPC scheme. This is the control scheme we realize in this research work, due to its facility and efficiency in the field of process control. Based upon LGPC scheme realization, it needs to be assumed that a CARIMA model has to be identified as the best representation of the system. It should be noted that CARIMA model identification actually needs to be identified prior to realizing the LGPC scheme.</p>
<p>The main goal of the present paper is to develop a novel control scheme for a distillation column that combines AI-based techniques with the MBPC scheme. In order to describe all of the control elements in the proposed strategy, at first, a TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach needs to be realized to identify an appropriate model of the column system. In fact, the proposed TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach is realized to make an accurate prediction of the system, once the LGPC scheme is correspondingly designed. In the area of related research works, many publications are available regarding the combination of an LGPC approach and a number of AI-based techniques. In line with the matter presented here, a TSK fuzzy-based model is used to represent a number of linear time invariant plants (described by ARIMAX models) for the purpose of dealing with an LGPC scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142331211417279">Hadjili and Wertz 1999</xref>) The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142331211417279">Hadjili and Wertz (1999)</xref> presents an efficient control algorithm in dealing with the system parameters, but is not applied for a specific industrial process to be taken into account, as a practical control method. The present LGPC scheme using RFNN is also realized for industrial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142331211417279">Chi-Huang and Ching-Chih 2007</xref>). The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142331211417279">Chi-Huang and Ching-Chih (2007)</xref> presents a design methodology for predictive control of a physical variable-frequency oil-cooling machine via RFNNs.</p>
<p>In this research, a discrete-time mathematical model and also a RLS learning algorithm are realized to identify the model unknown parameters. In such a case, LGPC scheme with integral action is designed based upon the minimization of a performance criterion, where the stability and steady-state performance of the control system are appropriately resulted. In the area of system presented here, a TSK fuzzy-based model, in an off-line manner, is realized to combine with an LGPC scheme to control a system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142331211417279">Qiang et al. 2006</xref>). This method uses both a fuzzy-based approach and a weighted recursive least-squares (RLS) method to identify a TSK fuzzy-based model, in its off-line form. After that, this identified model is realized with an LGPC scheme to control nonlinear systems. Hereinafter, a fuzzy-based model predictive control is investigated for a nonlinear system, using GA, where a TSK fuzzy-based model is given, as a predictor of the system behavior, in order to organize its control scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142331211417279">Sarimveis and Bafas 2003</xref>). In such a case, we can see a constrained predictive control in accordance with TSK fuzzy-based model for a nonlinear system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142331211417279">Bail et al. 2007</xref>). In this solution, at first, a TSK fuzzy-based model in association with the fuzzy-based clustering algorithm and also the orthogonal least-squares method is realized to represent a nonlinear system. Afterwards, in order to realize this model, an LGPC scheme, with input constraints, is described. A multiple fuzzy-based model temperature predictive control is given for a nonlinear system, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142331211417279">Ming et al. 2005</xref>). In another case, an LGPC scheme, using artificial neural network plant model, is given to handle a bio-process, as a realistic nonlinear system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142331211417279">Rusnak et al. 1996</xref>), while this scheme, using a multi-layer feed-forward neural network, is also suggested as a nonlinear model for the purpose of dealing with a complex system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142331211417279">Soloway and Haley 1997</xref>). Hereinafter, an LGPC scheme in association with the multi-layer feed-forward neural network, as a model of the nonlinear system, is investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142331211417279">Chidrawar et al. 2009</xref>). As is obvious from the present research works, each one of them proposes a specific method to realize an LGPC scheme for a nonlinear system. In fact, these control solutions are all investigated to cope with the system through an LGPC scheme.</p>
<p>The main differences between the proposed strategy and specially those obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142331211417279">Hadjili and Wertz (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142331211417279">Chi-Huang and Ching-Chih (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142331211417279">Qiang et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142331211417279">Sarimveis and Bafas (2003)</xref> are twofold. In this paper, first the prediction of the system behavior is accurately made through a set of TSK fuzzy-based models, using a so-called fuzzy-based predictive approach, where the nonlinearity of the system could actually be dealt with. Subsequently, an LGPC scheme is organized in a novel manner, through the proposed approach, to support the present system modeling approach. It should be noted that the limitations of the surveyed researches may be taken into account in the type of realizations and corresponding concepts, in our point of view. This means that a number of them are all organized in line with standard control schemes to deal with the present system, where AI-based techniques in accordance with the control theories are realized to organize some other control methods, in an efficient manner. In these cases, the second control methods are efficiently realized to deal with the system in comparison with the first, in which the wide range of system operating points could be abruptly varied, at each instance of time. As is obvious here, the control scheme, in the present research, falls into the second category. Owing to the fact that the proposed control scheme is configurable by choosing a number of TSK fuzzy-based models, which are used in the proposed TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach, its efficiency with respect to each other could be taken into real consideration. In fact, this facility aims to organize a configurable control scheme, once we are faced with a highly complex system, at each instance of time. In other words, the complexity of the proposed control scheme could correspondingly be increased, while complex systems are used to control. Moreover, it is also shown that this complexity could be decreased, while simple linear or nonlinear systems are chosen. In the same way, the proposed control scheme could easily be realized to deal with a number of real systems, because of the fact that the present adjustable control method is easy to realize in accordance with the model of the system. As a result, the advantage of the proposed control scheme with respect to related schemes is that it deals with a wide range of highly nonlinear systems, provided that their CARIMA representations of the system could accurately be identified. This means that the present method is easy to reorganize by changing the system from one to another. Also, the performance of the proposed method is efficient for each one of the chosen systems, at each instance of time, owing to its facility in identifying the system behavior through AI-based techniques in association with the powerful control theory, i.e. an LGPC scheme.</p>
<p>The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows. The distillation column system is given in Section 2. The proposed AI-based control scheme is given in Section 3. Finally, the simulation results and the concluding remarks are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.</p>

<p>In order for the implementation of the control strategy, the proposed TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach first has to be realized. In fact, the system could appropriately be identified through the proposed approach, while the system behavior is abruptly varied, at each instance of time. With this purpose, this model is realized using the number of IF–THEN rules and the corresponding input–output fuzzy sets, respectively.

<p>Regarding the number of fuzzy sets used in the present SOFS, they are all dependent on the range of system output variation and its accuracy, directly. It should be noted that the performance of the proposed control scheme could efficiency be increased by employing the large number of the fuzzy sets, while the realization of the control method is correspondingly complicated. In fact, we need to find the optimal number of the system output fuzzy sets to be realized here. Since the performance of the proposed method could not be increased, by increasing these fuzzy sets in number, in a corresponding manner, the optimal number could easily be calculated. In this regard, by choosing the correct number, the minimum complexity of the proposed approach in the maximum efficiency could be acquired. Regarding the terms of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula11-0142331211417279">Equation (3.2)</xref>, as ECARIMA representation of the system, it is better to note that these terms are extended results of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula10-0142331211417279">Equation (3.1)</xref>, as CARIMA representations of the system. In such a case, the first and the second terms of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula11-0142331211417279">Equation (3.2)</xref> are related to the first term of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula10-0142331211417279">Equation (3.1)</xref>, while the third and the fourth terms are also related to the second term of the present one. In fact, it is easy to follow how to extend <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula10-0142331211417279">Equation (3.1)</xref> through <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula11-0142331211417279">Equation (3.2)</xref> by making a long-range system prediction. Based upon these formulations, this TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach could be realized, as the best representation of the system, at each instance of time. Now, the proposed TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach could be organized as</p>

<p>It could also be shown that the exact number of the SOFSs employed in this method is equivalent to the number of system outputs. As is obvious from the system presented here, based upon the number of controlled outputs, two SOFSs need to be realized. In the control strategy presented, the LGPC scheme has to be realized in correspondence with the TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A study of an AI-based predictive control scheme has been presented in this paper that deals with a distillation column system. The present system is known as an appropriate separation process. It is organized based on a vertical column with a number of trays for the purpose of enhancing the component separations. In the area of the proposed AI-based control scheme, namely PIBC scheme, a realization of TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach is realized to organize the appropriate model of the system and also its control scheme, in an efficient manner. It is shown that the present TSK fuzzy-based predictive approach is realized to make a desirable prediction of the system to cope with the corresponding control scheme. Finally, the results are compared with the traditional fuzzy-based PI control scheme.</p>

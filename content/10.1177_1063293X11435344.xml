This article proposes a fuzzy regression-based decision framework that considers future requirements for setting target levels of technical attributes in software quality function deployment. Ordered weighted averaging operators are employed to implement quantifier-guided aggregations that enable to calculate the integrated importance degree for each customer need by combining the current and future voice of customers.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the recent past, the software industry has undergone a huge revolution. With heightened competition, considerable effort has focused on improving the quality of software engineering process. Quality improvement techniques, which have received increasing attention parallel to the upward trend in the use of computer technology applications, have been recently applied to respond to the need for enhanced software quality. Quality function deployment (QFD), as a technique for better quality designs that match customer needs, has been utilized to develop software that maximizes customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>In general, software manufacturers used to concentrate quality efforts on minimizing customer dissatisfaction. Problems in the customer needs are typically not recognized until late in the software engineering process, where negative impacts are substantial and cost for correction has grown large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063293X11435344">Davis, 1993</xref>). No other part of the product design and development process is more difficult to rectify later than customer requirement analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X11435344">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, methods for better understanding customer needs in software development are of great interest.</p>
<p>Customer requirement management, which entails various issues related to capturing, analyzing, and understanding of customer needs, is a key factor for offering customer-focused products to achieve customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063293X11435344">Jiao and Chen, 2006</xref>). QFD is a strategic tool to help companies in developing products and services responsive to customer needs. QFD enables the companies to become proactive to quality problems rather than taking a reactive position by acting on customer complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X11435344">Karsak et al., 2003</xref>). The basic concept of QFD is to translate the desires of customers into technical attributes (engineering characteristics), and subsequently into part characteristics, process plans, and production requirements. In order to establish these relationships, QFD usually requires four matrices, which are product planning, part deployment, process planning, and production/operation planning matrices, respectively, each corresponding to a stage of the product development cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063293X11435344">Shillito, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Software quality function deployment (SQFD) represents a transfer of the technology of QFD from product manufacturing to software development. SQFD is a structured methodology that focuses on improving the quality of software development process to create products responsive to customer expectations by deploying the voice of customer (VOC) throughout the development process. As a front-end technique, SQFD is an adaptation of the house of quality (HOQ), the most commonly used matrix in the traditional QFD methodology(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063293X11435344">Haag et al., 1996</xref>). The objective of the house of quality (HOQ) is to determine the target levels of technical attributes of a product to maximize customer satisfaction. The process of setting target levels is, in general, accomplished in a subjective ad hoc manner, or in a heuristic way. Due to many tradeoffs that may exist among implicit or explicit relationships between customer needs and technical attributes and among technical attributes, these relationships cannot be identified using engineering knowledge. Moreover, such relationships are generally vague in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X11435344">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). The vagueness arises mainly from the fact that the customer needs, which tend to be subjective, qualitative, and nontechnical, need to be translated into technical attributes which should be expressed in more quantitative and technical terms. Furthermore, data available for product design is often limited, inaccurate, or vague at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X11435344">Kim et al., 2000</xref>). The inherent fuzziness of relationships in QFD modeling justifies the use of fuzzy regression.</p>
<p>Traditional QFD only used the VOC obtained previously, which is the past VOC. This strategy will not work for strongly innovative products. Under rapidly changing environments, customers change their opinions and thus have requirements that are rather dynamic than static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063293X11435344">Xie et al., 2003</xref>). There is a time lag from the collection of the VOC to the marketing of the final product. Hence, the VOC obtained at early stage of design process may be outdated and it is likely that the final product cannot fully meet customer needs at the time when the product is introduced to the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063293X11435344">Shen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063293X11435344">Withanage et al., 2010</xref>). The importance of each customer need might be the same as before or it might have increased or decreased after a product is designed and manufactured. In order to deal with the change, a proactive approach is a time-based extension by listening to the future voice of the customer (FVOC). Quantitatively, the FVOC contains the new prioritization of customer needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063293X11435344">Xie et al., 2003</xref>). In QFD analysis, a single HOQ can be used with the integrated VOC obtained by combining the current and future VOCs. This article focuses on formulating an overall decision function of importance degree such that for any customer need, the score obtained by the decision function indicates the integrated importance degree to which the desired requirements with respect to present and forthcoming periods are satisfied.</p>
<p>This article proposes to employ ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators to implement quantifier-guided aggregations, which enable to calculate the integrated importance degree for each customer need. Then, a fuzzy mathematical program, which considers the integrated importance degrees calculated by combining the current and future VOCs, is developed to determine the target levels of technical attributes using the functional relationships obtained by fuzzy regression. Differing from most of the earlier studies, which use only center values of the fuzzy parameter estimates, this article considers both the center values and the spread values of the parameter estimates in the modeling phase, and thus, avoids loss of information in determining target levels of technical attributes.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is organized as follows. In the “Literature review” section, a brief literature review on SQFD is provided. The “Model formulation” section presents fuzzy regression-based decision framework that takes into account the future requirements for setting target levels of technical attributes of the new or improved software products that meet customer needs at the time when the product reaches the market. The “Illustrative application” section illustrates the proposed approach through an example that is based on a previously reported case study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X11435344">Liu et al. (2006a)</xref> Conclusions and directions for future research are given in the “Conclusion” section.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>SQFD originated in Japan in 1984, as a method to improve the quality of embedded software. Since then, SQFD has been used by many organizations, but as the use of SQFD in software development process provides companies a competitive advantage in global markets, only a few of them shared their knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063293X11435344">Haag et al., 1996</xref>). Despite the use of QFD in software development is gaining more attention, the number of published works on applying QFD to software industry is limited compared with the vast literature of QFD applications in manufacturing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1063293X11435344">Zultner (1993)</xref> presented basic components of total quality management (TQM), and then detailed the SQFD process as a quality improvement tool. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X11435344">Barnett and Raja (1995)</xref> proposed a four-stage model for performing SQFD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X11435344">Elboushi and Sherif (1997)</xref> used the QFD process with object-oriented design (OOD) software technology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1063293X11435344">Yilmaz and Chatterjee (1997)</xref> explained how TQM techniques can be used to facilitate the continuous improvement of software quality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063293X11435344">Liu (2000)</xref> adapted the four matrices of QFD that correspond to phases of product development cycle to software development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063293X11435344">Pai (2002)</xref> combined goal–question–metrics approach and SQFD to help software developers produce high-quality software that not only meets customer needs, but also achieves the goals of the project. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063293X11435344">Richardson (2002)</xref> proposed a software process improvement model based on QFD for use in small software development companies.</p>
<p>Several empirical studies reported the applications of QFD in software development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063293X11435344">Kekre et al. (1995)</xref> analyzed the key determinants of customer satisfaction with software products. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063293X11435344">Haag et al. (1996)</xref> reported the results of a survey of major software vendor firms that are using SQFD as an approach to software development quality improvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063293X11435344">Karlsson (1997)</xref> discussed positive and negative experiences gained while using QFD in a commercial large-scale software project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X11435344">Herzwurm and Schockert (2003)</xref> showed that QFD is suitable for planning e-business applications. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063293X11435344">Ip and Jacobs (2006)</xref> presented the outcomes from the application of QFD for interactive games development.</p>
<p>Few researchers developed quantitative approaches for determining importance weights of customer needs and prioritizing technical attributes in SQFD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063293X11435344">Buyukozkan and Feyzioglu (2005)</xref> proposed a group decision-making approach in which the prioritization of customer needs is achieved by fusing multiple expression formats in one collaborative group decision with fuzzy logic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063293X11435344">Ramires et al. (2005)</xref> proposed a groupware tool supporting the SQFD approach to validation of software requirements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X11435344">Liu et al. (2006a)</xref> utilized linear and nonlinear regression techniques for setting technical targets in SQFD, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X11435344">Liu et al. (2006b)</xref> developed a method for setting target values of engineering attributes by incorporating the technical trend and time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063293X11435344">Sener and Karsak (2010)</xref> presented a fuzzy regression and optimization approach to determine target levels in SQFD. The model proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063293X11435344">Sener and Karsak (2010)</xref>, which is based on current VOC, employs only center values of the fuzzy parameter estimates while ignoring their spread values.</p>

<title>Model formulation</title>
<p>The HOQ, the basic tool of SQFD, translates customer needs into technical attributes. The relationships between customer needs and technical attributes are defined in each cell in the HOQ. Pairwise comparison of technical attributes is performed in the roof matrix to incorporate the relationships among technical attributes.</p>
<p>The objective of the HOQ is to determine the target levels of technical attributes of a product to maximize customer satisfaction. The process of determining target values for technical attributes (TAs) to maximize overall customer satisfaction can be formulated as an optimization problem as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X11435344">Kim et al., 2000</xref>):</p>

<title>Quantifier-guided aggregations using OWA operators</title>
<p>In this article, we focus on the formulation of an overall decision function of importance degree such that for any customer need, the score obtained indicates the integrated importance degree for which the desired requirements with respect to present and forthcoming periods are satisfied. Thus, the current and future VOCs are combined to obtain a unified prioritization of customer needs.</p>
<p>To date, number of works concerning the use of FVOC is very limited in the published literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063293X11435344">Shillito (1994)</xref> was the first to point out the importance of this major problem in QFD and stated that VOC information related to the future can be collected using the Delphi questionnaire. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063293X11435344">Shen et al. (2001)</xref> used fuzzy trend analysis to extend the VOC into the future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063293X11435344">Xie et al. (2003)</xref> detailed the use of double exponential smoothing and fuzzy trend analysis techniques to project the FVOC. Lately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063293X11435344">Raharjo et al. (2006)</xref> proposed a mathematical model based on the quality loss function and the zero-one goal programming to prioritize engineering characteristics that meet the FVOC.</p>
<p>In decision processes with multiple information sources, in general, the final decision is made according to the majority of performance profiles given by different sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063293X11435344">Herrera et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, rather than requiring all the criteria to be satisfied, only some portion of the criteria need to be satisfied. This portion of the criteria can be specified in terms of a linguistic quantifier such as <italic>most</italic> or <italic>many</italic> or <italic>at least half.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063293X11435344">Yager (1996)</xref> suggested a generalization of this type of situation named as <italic>quantifier-guided aggregation</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063293X11435344">Zadeh (1983)</xref> suggested a formal representation of linguistic quantifiers using fuzzy sets. Any relative quantifier can be represented as a fuzzy subset <italic>Q</italic> of the unit interval <italic>I</italic> such that for each <italic>y</italic><italic>I</italic>, <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>y</italic>) indicates the degree to which <italic>y</italic> portion of the objects satisfies the concept denoted by <italic>Q</italic>. A fuzzy subset <italic>Q</italic> is called a regular increasing monotone (RIM) quantifier if <italic>Q</italic>(0) = 0, <italic>Q</italic>(1) = 1, and <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub>) ≥<italic>Q</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub>2</sub>) if <italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub> &gt; <italic>y</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>This work proposes to utilize OWA operators to implement quantifier-guided aggregations, which enable to compute the integrated importance degrees for each customer need. The OWA operators were introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063293X11435344">Yager (1996)</xref> in order to provide aggregations that lie between two extreme cases of multiple criteria decision-making problems that lead to the use of <italic>and</italic> and <italic>or</italic> operators to combine the criteria functions.</p>

<title>Fuzzy linear regression</title>
<p>The process of determining target levels of technical attributes using the information contained in a HOQ is generally accomplished in a subjective ad hoc manner. The conventional HOQ employs a rating scale to indicate the degree of relationships between customer needs and technical attributes. Determining a relationship rating scheme is critical in QFD applications; however, a justification for the choice of such a rating scale is not provided in the literature. Furthermore, relationships between customer needs and technical attributes and among technical attributes are generally vague in practice. The inherent fuzziness of relationships in QFD modeling justifies the use of fuzzy regression.</p>
<p>Likewise, data available for product design is often limited and inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X11435344">Kim et al., 2000</xref>). The assumptions of classical statistical regression such as the normality of error terms are difficult to justify unless a sufficiently large data set is available. The violation of these assumptions can adversely affect the performance of statistical regression model. Fuzzy regression has been reported as a more effective tool than statistical regression when the data set is insufficient to support statistical regression, human judgments are involved, and the degree of system fuzziness is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063293X11435344">Tanaka et al., 1982</xref>).</p>

<p>The fuzzy regression approach determines the center and the spread values of the regression parameters to satisfy the <italic>H</italic> level. <italic>H</italic> [0,1), which is referred to as a measure of goodness of fit, is selected by the decision maker. The criteria used to select the <italic>H</italic> value are generally ad hoc, and <italic>H</italic> values in previous research vary widely ranging from 0 to 0.9. The aim of fuzzy regression analysis is to minimize the total fuzziness of the predicted values for the dependent variables. The fuzzy regression approach to determine the functional relationships leads to the following linear programming model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063293X11435344">Tanaka and Watada, 1988</xref>):</p>

<p>Several studies utilized fuzzy regression to estimate the relationships in QFD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X11435344">Kim et al. (2000)</xref> employed fuzzy regression to determine the functional relationships in QFD. They defined the major components of their models using multiattribute value theory combined with fuzzy regression and fuzzy optimization without considering the cost factor. Following this pioneering article, a number of researchers presented more sophisticated fuzzy regression models for use in QFD by employing asymmetric fuzzy coefficients rather than symmetric fuzzy coefficients and integrating the least squares regression into fuzzy linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X11435344">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063293X11435344">Fung et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063293X11435344">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>QFD and fuzzy linear regression-based framework has also been used as an alternative decision tool for selection problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063293X11435344">Karsak (2008)</xref> used QFD and fuzzy regression-based optimization for robot selection. Lately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X11435344">Karsak and Özogul (2009)</xref> have proposed a decision model for enterprise resource planning (ERP) system selection based on QFD, fuzzy linear regression, and goal programming.</p>
<p>The coefficients of estimated functional relationships between customer needs and technical attributes and among technical attributes can be obtained by solving formulation (5). The resulting equations are given as follows:</p>

<p>In order to build a model that employs crisp parameters, the center value estimates from fuzzy regression can be used as the parameter estimates and the spread values can be neglected. If the spread values of fuzzy parameters are also considered, formulation (1) becomes a fuzzy mathematical programming problem with constraints having fuzzy coefficients as</p>

<p>Numerous methods for solving fuzzy mathematical programming problems have been developed. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063293X11435344">Lee and Li (1993)</xref>, the fuzzy equality constraints can be converted into an equivalent system of two inequality constraints using the lower bound and the upper bound of the α-cut of fuzzy parameters. For a given value of α, the equality constraints (8) and (9) can be transformed, respectively, to the following systems of inequality constraints (10) and (11):</p>

<title>Illustrative application</title>
<p>Search engines are widely used tools to find information on the Internet. Internet users are confronted with the need to choose from an increasing number of tools, each of them possessing their own advantages, disadvantages, and using different protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063293X11435344">Herring, 1999</xref>). Developing quality search engines is a crucial task for the designer. In spite of the development of information technology, most search engines were created without consideration for customer expectations. The quality of search engines is seldom considered from the user’s point of view, and thus, many customer-oriented quality aspects may not have been taken into serious consideration. Although the quality of Internet search engines is important in our daily lives, customer satisfaction regarding the quality of Internet search engines is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063293X11435344">Xie et al., 1998</xref>). SQFD can be used for the quality improvement problem of a search engine.</p>
<p>In this study, an application of the proposed approach is presented for determining optimal target values of technical attributes of a search engine, which is aimed to satisfy customer requirements. The illustrative example uses the HOQ shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X11435344">Figure 1</xref> for the design of a search engine. The five customer needs obtained through requirement analysis are <italic>scalability</italic> (<italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub>), <italic>reliability</italic> (<italic>y</italic><sub>2</sub>), <italic>speed</italic> (<italic>y</italic><sub>3</sub>), <italic>accuracy</italic> (<italic>y</italic><sub>4</sub>), and <italic>easy to use</italic> (<italic>y</italic><sub>5</sub>). The eight technical attributes determined in order to satisfy customer needs are <italic>response time</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>), <italic>database size</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>), <italic>precision</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>3</sub>), <italic>number of languages</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>4</sub>), <italic>unique hits</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>5</sub>), <italic>dead links</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>6</sub>), <italic>update time</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>7</sub>), and <italic>number of formats</italic> (<italic>x</italic><sub>8</sub>). The design team identified the relationships between customer needs and technical attributes. The interrelationships among the technical attributes are indicated in the roof of the HOQ. The engineering data set for customer and technical analysis is collected from the company (C6) and its five main competitors, C1 through C5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X11435344">Liu et al., 2006a</xref>). It is assumed that customer perception of the degree of satisfaction of each customer need has been scaled from 1 to the corresponding quality goal denoted in the HOQ. The objective of the problem is to determine optimal target values for eight technical attributes of the improved search engine to maximize customer satisfaction at the time when the search engine is ready for use.</p>

<p>According to the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063293X11435344">Table 3</xref>, the <italic>z</italic> value increases as α decreases, that is, as more fuzziness in the system parameters is considered in the optimization model. When there exist no fuzziness (α = 1), the <italic>z</italic> value obtained from the optimization model (= 0.720) is relatively high compared with the current <italic>z</italic> value of C6 (= 0.665), and thus, C6 ranks the second among six competitors considering the outcomes of the optimization model. Alternatively, when total fuzziness is allowed (α = 0), the <italic>z</italic> value obtained for the optimization model, which is 0.986, exceeds that of C5 (= 0.840), which has the highest <italic>z</italic> value among all six competitors.</p>
<p>The results of the fuzzy regression-based decision framework, which considers future requirements, enable the design team to concentrate on the technical attributes that would maximize overall customer satisfaction. For example, considering the optimal values of technical attributes for the improved search engine obtained using the proposed approach with α = 0.4, C6 has to improve its design performance in response time (<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>) by 69.5%, database size (<italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>) by 83.1%, precision (<italic>x</italic><sub>3</sub>) by 22.9%, unique hits (<italic>x</italic><sub>5</sub>) by 24.7%, dead links (<italic>x</italic><sub>6</sub>) by 183.9%, update time (<italic>x</italic><sub>7</sub>) by 49.9%, number of formats (<italic>x</italic><sub>8</sub>) by 45.2%, and by trading off performance value in number of languages (<italic>x</italic><sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063293X11435344">Tanaka and Watada (1988)</xref> stated that the <italic>H</italic> value should be selected based on the sufficiency of the collected data set. When the data set is sufficiently large, <italic>H</italic> = 0 can be used and larger <italic>H</italic> value is needed with the decrease in volume of data. Thus, we examine how the selection of <italic>H</italic> affects the degree of satisfaction of customer needs in our case. Solving formulation (5) for <italic>H</italic> values ranging from 0 to 0.9 does not change the center values but influences the spread values, and a higher <italic>H</italic> value results in a larger spread of fuzzy parameters. For comparative analysis, <italic>H</italic> = 0 is used rather than the initial <italic>H</italic> value of 0.5 while solving the proposed model with α = 0.4. For <italic>H</italic> = 0, lower degree of satisfaction values are obtained for scalability, reliability, speed, and easy to use, while degree of satisfaction for accuracy remains the same. Likewise, the overall satisfaction (<italic>z</italic>) decreases from 0.966 to 0.861 when <italic>H</italic> = 0 is used.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The process of determining target levels of technical attributes using the information contained in a HOQ is a complex decision process, which is generally accomplished in a subjective ad hoc manner in SQFD. Fuzzy models have an advantage over the crisp representation for incorporating subjective and qualitative data into the QFD decision-making process in a quantifiable structure. Fuzzy decision-making techniques also prove useful in assessing relationships between customer needs and technical attributes, and among technical attributes that are generally vague in practice. The inherent fuzziness of functional relationships in QFD modeling promotes fuzzy regression as an effective tool for parameter estimation. In this article, fuzzy regression is used to estimate the parameters of functional relationships between customer needs and technical attributes and interrelationships among technical attributes. Fuzzy regression does not require the stringent assumptions of statistical regression, and it is more suitable in addressing product design problems where the data set is limited and the degree of system fuzziness is high.</p>
<p>Quantitative approaches for determining target levels in QFD consider customer needs obtained previously. Therefore, an innovative product cannot fully meet customer expectations when it is ready to market. In order to avoid this problem, it is essential to forecast the changes on customers’ future preferences. In this article, a fuzzy mathematical programming model, which uses the functional relationships obtained by fuzzy linear regression, is developed by considering future requirements to determine target levels of the new or improved software products that meet customer needs at the time when the product reaches the market. Fuzzy mathematical programming model enables to incorporate not only the center values but also the spread values of the parameter estimates into the optimization process, and thus, avoids loss of information in the design phase.</p>
<p>Albeit QFD aims to develop quality products responsive to customer needs, other aspects such as cost, tools and technology, environmental factors, and infrastructure also need to be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063293X11435344">Prasad, 2000</xref>). In other words, in addition to quality, a number of company objectives should be included in the model. In order to achieve time compression and optimal performance with respect to meeting customer and company interests for the product’s design, a concurrent approach is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063293X11435344">Prasad et al., 1998</xref>). Concurrent function deployment (CFD), as a method for running parallel deployments, is suitable to deploy competing values simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063293X11435344">Prasad, 2000</xref>). Since the illustrative example presented in this study uses data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X11435344">Liu et al. (2006a)</xref> that is provided in the form of an HOQ, the focus is limited to a QFD framework with FVOC. For future study, a decision-making framework based on CFD that considers FVOC can be developed to extend the HOQ-based model in a way to account for other company objectives as well as maximizing customer satisfaction during the software development process.</p>

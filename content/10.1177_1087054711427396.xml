<p>It is estimated that approximately one third of the children in the United States suffer from a mental health disorder, with ADHD identified as one of the most common mental health disorders in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427396">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711427396">Bird et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711427396">Duchnowski, Kutash, &amp; Friedman, 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, less than 50% of these children receive professional services of any kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711427396">Kataoka, Zhang, &amp; Wells, 2002</xref>), with this percentage sharply rising for Latino and other ethnic minority youth despite their greater risk for developing mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711427396">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711427396">Kataoka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1087054711427396">Yeh, McCabe, Hough, Dupuis, &amp; Hazen, 2003</xref>). To combat the disparity between need and utilization of services among ethnic minority families, researchers have begun to emphasize the importance of developing culturally appropriate mental health assessments and interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427396">Callejas, Nesman, Mowery, &amp; Gamache, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427396">Flores et al., 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, progress toward this goal cannot be accomplished without reliable, valid, and culturally appropriate assessment tools. Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine the psychometric and cultural properties, as well as the diagnostic utility of a Spanish translation of a commonly used Parent-Rating Scale for ADHD with a community sample of Spanish-speaking, Latino parents.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087054711427396">
<title>Mental Health Disparities</title>
<p>Understanding the current mental health disparities that exist among Latinos is a public health concern as they are one of the fastest growing ethnic minority groups in the United States and are estimated to compromise approximately one fifth of the children in our country by the middle of this century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1087054711427396">Ramirez &amp; de la Cruz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711427396">Day, 2010</xref>). This is of particular importance for the field of clinical child psychology as research suggests that Latino youth are at an increased risk for developing childhood externalizing disorders, such as ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711427396">Canino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711427396">Dominguez de Ramirez &amp; Shapiro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1087054711427396">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1087054711427396">Yeh et al., 2003</xref>). Despite this increased risk, they are less likely than any other ethnic minority group to be treated in clinical or school-based settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711427396">Garland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711427396">Hough et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711427396">Kataoka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1087054711427396">Rowland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1087054711427396">Woods et al., 2005</xref>), and their parents are less likely than Caucasian parents to pursue and successfully complete psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711427396">Kazdin, Holland, &amp; Crowley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711427396">Leslie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711427396">McCabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054711427396">McMiller &amp; Weisz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1087054711427396">Safer &amp; Malever, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Both practical and cultural factors have been identified as contributing to this discrepancy between need and utilization of mental health services by Latino families. Unfortunately, common practical barriers experienced by many of these families, such as lack of health insurance, unreliable transportation, and inability to pay for child care, are likely the direct result of limited parental education and poverty, which are far too common in ethnic minority families in this country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711427396">Alegría et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711427396">Flores, Abreu, Olivar, &amp; Kastner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1087054711427396">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1087054711427396">Vega &amp; Lopez, 2001</xref>). Although some barriers to care may not be specific to Latinos, but rather shared by families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, several additional barriers are specific to Latino families, including immigration status, command of the English language, lack of knowledge about and distrust of the mental health field, and lack of bilingual/bicultural providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427396">Callejas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427396">Flores et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1087054711427396">Peifer, Hu, &amp; Vega, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond these initial cultural barriers, research also suggests that culture likely influences Latino parental beliefs about the etiology of mental illness, as well as schemas for mental health disorders, such as ADHD. Specifically, initial findings suggest that Latino parents are less likely to perceive biopsychosocial (e.g., medical or physical) factors as causes of their children’s mental health disorders, which also may explain their underutilization of professional mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1087054711427396">Yeh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1087054711427396">Yeh, Hough, McCabe, Lau, &amp; Garland, 2004</xref>). It also has been suggested that the development of Latino parental schemas for ADHD are based on the child’s functioning (e.g., poor academic performance, peer problems), rather than the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427396">APA, 2000</xref>) symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427396">Arcia &amp; Fernández, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427396">Bauermeister et al., 2005</xref>). In sum, these findings suggest that Latino parents may not recognize ADHD symptoms in their children, and if they do, they may not perceive them as having a biopsychosocial origin, which may result in them not identifying the behaviors as problematic or in need of mental health assessment and treatment.</p>

<title>Assessment of ADHD</title>
<p>To meet <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria for ADHD, a child must be displaying a developmentally inappropriate level of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity <italic>and</italic> must be experiencing impairment due to these symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427396">APA, 2000</xref>). Although rarely used outside of university-based clinics, comprehensive ADHD assessments use a multimethod, multi-informant approach, which emphasizes the importance of gathering information using several methods (i.e., interviews, measures, and observations) and several informants (i.e., parents and teachers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711427396">Pelham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711427396">Pelham, Fabiano, &amp; Massetti, 2005</xref>). Using this approach allows for a thorough diagnostic assessment of ADHD symptomatology and other commonly occurring disorders, as well as an analysis of functional impairment, which is crucial for effective treatment planning. Unfortunately, most children in the United States do not receive a comprehensive assessment when they present with ADHD symptoms. The “typical” ADHD assessment involves the completion of an ADHD symptom checklist by the mother in the pediatrician’s office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711427396">Pelham et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, when examining evidence-based assessment of ADHD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711427396">Pelham et al. (2005)</xref> concluded that the “diagnostic phase of assessment should be completed with minimal time and expense” (pp. 449) given that the diagnostic label does not have treatment utility. Specifically, they argued that interviews do not provide incremental validity beyond the use of Parent- <italic>and</italic> Teacher-Rating Scales, which can be completed and scored quickly; however, they also emphasized that a <italic>diagnostic</italic> assessment is not sufficient for treatment planning and monitoring. Thus, Pelham and colleagues argued that in addition to establishing the presence and severity of <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptoms, an evidence-based ADHD assessment should include assessment of functional impairments, identification of specific behaviors to be targeted in treatment, and identification of any contributing environmental factors. Others also have argued that our current approach to clinical assessments has resulted in an overemphasis on symptoms with a neglect of functional problems or impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711427396">Gordon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054711427396">Raggi &amp; Chronis, 2006</xref>). In addition, even though ADHD symptoms create the functional problems observed in children with ADHD, research indicates that the assessment of symptoms and functional problems are not highly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711427396">Gordon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054711427396">Raggi &amp; Chronis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1087054711427396">Smith, Barkley, &amp; Shapiro, 2006</xref>), which suggests the importance of examining both when completing an assessment.</p>

<sec id="section3-1087054711427396">
<title>Culturally Appropriate ADHD Assessments</title>
<p>This overreliance on identification of ADHD symptoms may be particularly problematic when assessing ethnic minority children, such as Latinos. Although limited, research suggests that shifting our focus to the identification of <italic>functional impairment</italic>s commonly associated with ADHD (e.g., difficulty getting along with others or performing poorly at school) may serve as a more culturally appropriate way of assessing for ADHD given that impairment, rather than symptoms, may be a more universally shared construct across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427396">Arcia &amp; Fernández, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427396">Bauermeister et al., 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, research has not moved in this direction yet. Current recommendations emphasize the importance of conducting a linguistically and culturally appropriate assessment. Thus, to date, the focus of research has been on establishing the psychometric and cultural properties of Spanish translations of assessment measures that were designed for use with Caucasian families.</p>
<p>Specifically, several global measures of child psychopathology (e.g., the Child Behavior Checklist/6-18 [CBCL]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427396">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054711427396">Rubio-Stipec, Bird, Canino, &amp; Gould, 1990</xref>), as well as disorder-specific measures (e.g., the Conners-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427396">Conners, 2008</xref>) and diagnostic interviews (e.g., the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children–Version IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1087054711427396">Shaffer, Fisher, Lucus, Dulcan, &amp; Schwab-Stone, 2000</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711427396">Bravo et al., 2001</xref>) have been translated to Spanish and examined to determine their psychometric properties. Research suggests that these translated measures demonstrate good reliability and validity. Importantly, this line of research has been extended to include specific measures of functional impairment in addition to symptoms, as well as to examine cultural properties of the measures in addition to psychometric properties. Specifically, findings suggest that translated measures of parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index–Short Form; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711427396">Abidin, 1995</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1087054711427396">Solis &amp; Abidin, 1991</xref>), efficacy (Parental Sense of Competence Scale; as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711427396">Johnston &amp; Mash, 1989</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711427396">Haack, Gerdes, Schneider, &amp; Hurtado, 2011</xref>), and behavior (Alabama Parenting Questionnaire; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1087054711427396">Shelton, Frick, &amp; Wootton, 1996</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711427396">Haack, Gerdes, Schneider, et al., 2011</xref>) as well as family chaos (Confusion Hubbub and Order Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054711427396">Matheny, Wachs, Ludwig, &amp; Phillips, 1995</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711427396">Haack, Gerdes, Schneider, et al., 2011</xref>) demonstrate psychometric properties similar to the English versions. Recently, many of these measures also have been shown to demonstrate cultural validity in that they appropriately correlate with theoretically related measures of acculturation.</p>
<p>Beyond establishing the psychometric and cultural properties of commonly used assessment measures, additional measures assessing cultural factors also are recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054711427396">Padilla &amp; Medina, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1087054711427396">Rothe, 2005</xref>). This recommendation is based on research showing that relative to Caucasian parents, Latinos are more likely to hold collectivist values, spiritual beliefs about the etiology of mental health problems, and an external locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711427396">Lujan &amp; Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1087054711427396">Skinner, Correa, Skinner, &amp; Bailey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1087054711427396">Yeh et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1087054711427396">2005</xref>), which increase the likelihood that a parent may be more accepting of their child’s difficult behaviors, as well as less likely to perceive them as problematic or in need of mental health treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711427396">Arcia &amp; Fernández, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711427396">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1087054711427396">Rothe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1087054711427396">Schmitz &amp; Velez, 2003</xref>). Thus, as part of a comprehensive assessment, it may be helpful to have Latino parents complete a measure of acculturation to determine how acculturated the family is to Anglo culture versus Latino culture (e.g., Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans [ARSMA]-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711427396">Cuéllar, Arnold, &amp; Maldonado, 1995</xref>), as well as a measure of core Latino values (e.g., Mexican American Cultural Values Scale for Adolescents and Adults; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711427396">Knight et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1087054711427396">
<title>Psychometric Properties, Cultural Properties, and Diagnostic Utility</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, the first step toward providing a linguistically appropriate assessment involves translating the measures of interest and establishing their psychometric properties. Although there are many ways to determine if a measure is psychometrically sound, the most common methods include establishing the measure’s reliability or internal consistency as determined by a Cronbach’s alpha of .70 or higher, as well as construct validity, which is typically established by examining convergent and discriminant validity (i.e., examining how well the measure is correlated with measures assessing a similar construct and how well it is uncorrelated with measures assessing a different construct; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711427396">Cortina, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711427396">Cronbach, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711427396">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054711427396">Messick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1087054711427396">Sattler, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although determining the psychometric properties of a translated measure is essential, establishing the measure’s cultural properties also is necessary to provide a culturally appropriate assessment. Factors of acculturation and cultural values (e.g., familism) have been shown to affect parental and family functioning in Latinos, as well as parental perceptions related to normal child development and the origin and identification of mental health problems in their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711427396">Bornstein &amp; Cote, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711427396">Miranda, Bilot, Peluso, Berman, &amp; Van Meek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054711427396">Miranda, Estrada, &amp; Firpo-Jimenez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1087054711427396">Rodriguez, Mira, Paez, &amp; Myers, 2007</xref>). Thus, it is possible that a psychometrically sound measure may not be entirely appropriate for use with certain ethnic minority groups if cultural factors result in the measure no longer being culturally valid. Unfortunately, there is no well-established method for examining the cultural properties of translated measures. However, theoretical research suggests that ethnicity should not be examined as a categorical variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711427396">Comstock, Castillo, &amp; Lindsay, 2004</xref>), and recent research has provided evidence for the cultural properties of translated measures by examining their relation with a measure of acculturation, a dimensional variable assessing one’s cultural values and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711427396">Haack, Gerdes, Schneider, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, when examining measures that were designed to be used when conducting clinical assessments, determining the translated measure’s diagnostic utility is important to examine. This is typically accomplished by calculating the positive predictive power (PPP) and negative predictive power (NPP) of the measure, which examine the probability of the disorder given the presence or absence of a symptom, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711427396">Landau, Milich, &amp; Widiger, 1991</xref>). Several studies with predominately Caucasian samples (all of whom were English speakers) have provided evidence for the diagnostic utility of the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> ADHD symptoms in predicting the presence of ADHD (community sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711427396">Owens &amp; Hoza, 2003</xref>; clinical sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711427396">Frick et al., 1994</xref>). However, as discussed previously, it is quite possible that a measure demonstrating diagnostic utility in one population may not be entirely appropriate for diagnosing children of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Thus, in an effort to lessen the mental health disparities that exist for Latino families in our country and to provide evidence-based, culturally appropriate assessments of childhood ADHD, the goal of the current study was to determine the psychometric and cultural properties, as well as the diagnostic utility of the Spanish translation of the Parent Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBD-S), which is a commonly used measure of <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptoms of ADHD and related externalizing disorders. To establish the psychometric properties of the DBD-S, reliability and validity of the ADHD subscales (i.e., Inattentive and Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptom subscales as well as the Total ADHD subscale) were examined. It was predicted that the ADHD subscales of the DBD-S would demonstrate good reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values ≥.70. It was also predicted that the ADHD subscales would demonstrate good convergent validity by correlating with other measures of behavioral problems (i.e., the Broadband Externalizing Scale of the Spanish CBCL/6-18 [CBCL-S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427396">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054711427396">Rubio-Stipec et al., 1990</xref>] and the Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales of the Spanish Conners-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427396">Conners, 2008</xref>]). Finally, it was predicted that the ADHD subscales would demonstrate good concurrent validity by appropriately distinguishing problem children from nonproblem children as measured by the Broadband Externalizing Scale of the CBCL-S and the Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales of the Spanish Conners-3.</p>
<p>Consistent with theoretical research arguing against measuring ethnicity categorically and previous research methodology examining ethnicity dimensionally based on an individual’s values and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711427396">Comstock et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711427396">Haack, Gerdes, Schneider, et al., 2011</xref>), the cultural properties of the DBD-S were determined by comparing the relationship between the ADHD subscales and a measure of acculturation (i.e., Mexican and Anglo orientation on the ARSMA-II) to the relationship between acculturation and measures of functional impairment (i.e., Learning Problems, Aggression Problems, Executive Functioning Problems, and Peer Problems subscales on the Spanish Conners-3). Subscales were considered culturally unbiased if no relationship emerged between the subscales and measures of acculturation, suggesting that one’s cultural values and behaviors were not related to their ratings of symptomatology or functional impairment. It was predicted that measures of functional impairment would be culturally unbiased, whereas measures of ADHD symptomatology would be related to measures of acculturation, specifically Anglo orientation, suggesting potential cultural bias. Finally, to examine the diagnostic utility of the DBD-S with Spanish-speaking, Latino parents, the predictive power of individual ADHD symptoms was examined. It was predicted that the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms would not yield high diagnostic utility.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 68 Spanish-speaking, Latino parents who were recruited as part of a larger study examining the psychometric and cultural properties of several Spanish-language assessment measures. Parents had a mean age of 33.69 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.78) and were predominately female (85.30%) and of Mexican descent (85.30%). To be included in the study, parents had to have at least one child between the ages of 6 and 12 years. The majority of children were male (60.30%) and had a mean age of 7.96 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.01). Examination of demographic information revealed that participants were generally representative of the Latino population in that geographic region.

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Recruitment took place at elementary schools in a suburb of a moderate-sized midwestern city. Culturally appropriate recruitment strategies based on the National Institutes of Health (2002) recommendations were developed and used (for a more detailed explanation of recruitment, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711427396">Haack, Gerdes, Cruz, &amp; Schneider, 2011</xref>). Briefly, participants were initially contacted with a parent letter distributed by the school. Along with the letter describing the study, parents received a postcard indicating times that the research team would be available at the school. Parents were asked to return the postcard with their contact information if they were interested in participating. In addition, Latino parents from three of the four schools received automated phone calls from the school describing the project and encouraging interested parents to call the school. Bilingual and bicultural research assistants also attended family-oriented events at the elementary schools to provide additional information about the study, as research has shown that face-to-face contact is especially important when recruiting ethnically diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1087054711427396">Roosa et al., 2008</xref>). Participation took approximately 1 hr and occurred at the elementary schools, either following the school day or at school-sponsored events. Due to parental schedules, several parents needed to leave the session prior to completing their packets. These parents either completed the remainder of their packets over the phone with a bilingual research assistant or returned their packet via mail. All analyses were run with and without data from these parents, and the pattern of findings remained the same. Following consent, parents independently completed the measures and were encouraged to ask bilingual research assistants any questions that arose. Parents received a US$10 gift card for their participation.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Measures of interest for the current study included DBD-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711427396">Pelham, Gnagy, Greenslade, &amp; Milich, 1992</xref>), CBCL/6-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427396">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054711427396">Rubio-Stipec et al., 1990</xref>), Conners 3–Parent Short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427396">Conners, 2008</xref>), and ARSMA-II (Cuellar et al., 1995).</p>
<sec id="section10-1087054711427396">
<title>DBD-S</title>
<p>The DBD-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711427396">Pelham et al., 1992</xref>) is a 42-item parent-report measure that examines symptoms of disruptive behavior disorders, including ADHD, with symptoms measured on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3. Symptoms are considered to be clinically present if they receive a rating of 2 (<italic>pretty much</italic>) or 3 (<italic>very much</italic>). The English version of the Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBD) has demonstrated good psychometric properties. Internal consistency greater than .70 has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711427396">Gerdes &amp; Hoza, 2006</xref>), and the measure has been shown to have diagnostic utility in predicting the presence of ADHD in a community sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711427396">Owens &amp; Hoza, 2003</xref>). Consistent with recommendations by Brislin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427396">Brislin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711427396">Brislin, Lonner, &amp; Thorndike, 1973</xref>), the Spanish translation of this measure was forward and back translated by two different bilingual individuals. Initial modifications were made after comparisons between the original English and back-translated English were completed, and additional modifications were made after the Spanish translation was reviewed by a third bilingual mental health professional.</p>

<sec id="section11-1087054711427396">
<title>CBCL-S</title>
<p>The CBCL-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427396">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>; Spanish translation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054711427396">Rubio-Stipec et al., 1990</xref>) is a 112-item parent-report measure that assesses a wide variety of childhood problems, including both internalizing and externalizing problems. Items are scored on a 3-point scale; 0 indicates the item is <italic>not true</italic>, 1 indicates it is <italic>somewhat</italic> or <italic>sometimes true</italic>, and 2 indicates it is <italic>very true</italic> or <italic>often true</italic>. The measure provides broadband scores for internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, as well as more specific syndrome scales; the broadband externalizing score is the only one of interest in the current study. Extensive research with the English version has indicated strong psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427396">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001</xref>). The CBCL-S has also demonstrated good psychometric properties; the Broadband Internalizing and Externalizing Scales have good internal consistency, with alphas ranging from .89 to .94, and good concurrent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054711427396">Rubio-Stipec et al., 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Spanish Conners 3–Parent Short</title>
<p>The Spanish Conners-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427396">Conners, 2008</xref>) is a 23-item parent-report measure that examines ADHD symptoms (Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Scales) and related problems (Learning Problems, Executive Functioning, Aggression, and Peer Relations Scales). Items are measured on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not true at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very much true</italic>). Higher scores indicate more difficulty in that domain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427396">Conners (2008)</xref> reported good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .84) for the Spanish version; strong convergent and discriminate validity also have been reported for the English version.</p>

<sec id="section13-1087054711427396">
<title>ARSMA-II</title>
<p>The ARSMA-II (Cuellar et al., 1995) is a 30-item, bidimensional measure of acculturation that measures an individual’s Mexican orientation (Mexican Orientation subscale [MOS]) and Anglo orientation (Anglo Orientation subscale [AOS]). The measure assesses (a) language use and preference, (b) ethnic identity and classification, and (c) ethnic interaction on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely often or almost always</italic>). Cuellar et al. (1995) reported coefficient alphas of .83 for the AOS and .88 for the MOS. Good construct validity also has been demonstrated by the measure’s ability to differentiate five generational levels of Mexicans and Mexican Americans (Cuellar et al., 1995).</p>

<title>Psychometric Properties</title>
<p>To establish the psychometric properties of the DBD-S, reliability and validity were examined. Specifically, the internal consistency of the DBD-S was determined by computing Cronbach’s α values for the ADHD subscales. As predicted, the ADHD subscales (i.e., Inattentive, Hyperactive-Impulsive, and Total ADHD) all revealed good internal consistencies with alpha values ≥.83 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711427396">Table 2</xref>). To determine convergent validity, correlations between the ADHD subscales and other broad measures of behavioral problems (i.e., the Broadband Externalizing Scale of the CBCL-S and the Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales from the Spanish Conners-3) were examined. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711427396">Table 3</xref>, all three ADHD subscales revealed significant correlations with all other measures of behavioral problems, ranging from .29 to .63.</p>

<p>Finally, to investigate the concurrent validity, binary logistic regressions examining the likelihood of the ADHD subscales in distinguishing problem from nonproblem children as measured by borderline or clinical elevations on the Broadband Externalizing Scale of the CBCL-S (i.e., <italic>T</italic>-scores of 59 or higher) and Spanish Conners-3 (i.e., <italic>T</italic>-scores of 65 or higher on either Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales) were used. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054711427396">Table 4</xref>, results of the models suggest that the ADHD subscales reliably distinguished between children displaying clinically significant externalizing problems. Examination of Cox and Snell and Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values demonstrates that between 10% and 31% of the variability in the presence of externalizing problems was explained by parental ratings on the ADHD subscales of the DBD-S, and examination of odds ratios indicate that parents who reported higher severity of symptomatology on the ADHD subscales were between 1.42 and 31.05 times more likely to report their child as clinically elevated for externalizing problems on the CBCL-S or Spanish Conners-3.</p>

<title>Cultural Properties</title>
<p>To determine the cultural properties of the DBD-S in relation to the cultural properties of functional impairment scales, correlations examining the relationship between parental acculturation and the ADHD subscales of the DBD-S as well as the functional impairment subscales of the Spanish Conners-3 were conducted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1087054711427396">Table 5</xref>). Parental acculturation was significantly and positively related to the Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptom subscale of the DBD-S (<italic>r</italic> = .24), such that higher Anglo orientation was related to higher ratings of hyperactivity-impulsivity. In addition, a trend toward significance for the Total ADHD subscale was observed (<italic>r</italic> = .20), such that higher Anglo orientation was marginally related to higher ratings of total ADHD symptomatology. Interestingly, parental acculturation was not significantly related to the Inattentive Symptom subscale. Similarly, no significant relationships between parental acculturation and ratings of functional impairment on the Spanish Conners-3 (e.g., learning problems, aggression problems, executive functioning problems, peer problems) were revealed.</p>

<title>Diagnostic Utility</title>
<p>Finally, to examine the diagnostic utility of the DBD-S, diagnostic criteria had to be established before computing the analyses related to PPP and NPP. A child was considered to have a diagnosis of ADHD if he or she met criteria on two of three clinical measures (i.e., the DBD-S, CBCL-S, or Spanish Conners-3). Criteria were met on the DBD-S if the parent endorsed six or more inattentive and/or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms with a rating of 2 or 3, indicating a moderate or severe problem. On the CBCL-S, criteria were met if the profile indicated a borderline or clinical elevation on the Externalizing Scale (i.e., a <italic>T</italic>-score ≥59), and on the Spanish Conners-3, criteria were met if the profile indicated clinical elevations (i.e., a <italic>T</italic>-score ≥65) on either the Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales. Using this method, six children (8.8%) met criteria for ADHD, which represents a similar prevalence as would be estimated in the larger population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427396">APA, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the above criteria, the diagnostic utility of the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> ADHD symptoms was calculated using corrected PPP (cPPP) and corrected NPP (cNPP) statistics for parent-reported symptoms on the DBD-S. The formulas for these calculations are equivalent to the formulas used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711427396">Frick et al. (1994)</xref>. The PPP statistic indicates the conditional probability that the disorder is present if the symptom is present, whereas the NPP statistic indicates the conditional probability that the disorder is absent if the symptom is absent. Both are corrected to control for the base rates of each symptom, which enables researchers to compare symptoms of different base rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711427396">Frick et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1087054711427396">Table 6</xref>, results indicate that, in general, the inattentive symptoms on the DBD-S had moderately strong diagnostic utility for predicting the presence of the disorder (<italic>M</italic> = .51, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.22). Two inattentive symptoms had particularly high diagnostic utility. Specifically, “often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly” and “often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities” had cPPP values of 0.73 and 1.00, respectively. In general, the inattentive symptoms also provided moderately strong diagnostic utility in predicting the absence of the disorder (<italic>M</italic> = .49, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.16). Specifically, four symptoms (i.e., “often is easily distracted,” “often fails to give close attention to details,” “often has difficulty sustaining attention,” and “often loses things”) had cNPP values greater than 0.60.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The existence of mental health disparities among Latinos is well documented, and recommendations related to providing culturally appropriate assessments and interventions have been set forth in an effort to combat these disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427396">Callejas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427396">Flores et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711427396">Garland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711427396">Hough et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711427396">Kataoka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1087054711427396">Rowland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1087054711427396">Woods et al., 2005</xref>). To date, much of the assessment research in this area has focused on translating existing assessment measures and examining their psychometric properties (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711427396">Bravo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427396">Conners, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054711427396">Rubio-Stipec et al., 1990</xref>). Although this is a good starting point, it may not be enough, especially in light of research documenting cultural differences in parental schemas for childhood mental health disorders, such as ADHD. Specifically, initial research suggests that the field’s overemphasis on <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptomatology may be particularly problematic when completing ADHD assessments with Latino families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427396">Arcia &amp; Fernández, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427396">Bauermeister et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine not only the psychometric properties of the DBD-S, a commonly used parent-report measure of ADHD symptoms but also the cultural properties and diagnostic utility of the measure in a community sample of Spanish-speaking, Latino parents. Results suggest that although both ADHD subscales of the DBD-S are psychometrically sound (i.e., they demonstrated good reliability and construct validity), the Hyperactive-Impulsive subscale may not be culturally appropriate with some Latino families, particularly those who are less acculturated. This was further supported by preliminary evidence suggesting that this subscale also was not diagnostically useful with the current, community sample.</p>
<sec id="section19-1087054711427396">
<title>Psychometric Properties</title>
<p>As predicted, examination of the psychometric properties of the DBD-S suggested that the ADHD subscales (i.e., Inattentive, Hyperactive-Impulsive, and Total ADHD) demonstrated good reliability, as well as convergent and concurrent validity. Specifically, all subscales had Cronbach’s alpha levels in the .80s to .90s, and all subscales were significantly correlated with the Externalizing Scale of the CBCL-S, as well as the ADHD subscales of the Spanish Conners-3, measures assessing similar constructs. Finally, all three subscales were able to distinguish problem from nonproblem children in that they explained between 10% and 31% of the variability in the presence of externalizing symptoms as measured by the CBCL-S and Spanish Conners-3. These findings are consistent with psychometric data reported for the English version of the DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711427396">Gerdes &amp; Hoza, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1087054711427396">
<title>Cultural Properties</title>
<p>In addition to establishing that the DBD-S is psychometrically sound, we also wanted to determine if its use with Spanish-speaking, Latino families was culturally appropriate. As partially predicted, one of the three ADHD subscales was significantly correlated with Anglo orientation, suggesting a possible cultural bias. Specifically, the Hyperactive-Impulsive subscale was positively correlated with Anglo orientation, suggesting that parents who were more acculturated endorsed more hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in their children. A trend toward significance in the same direction also emerged for the Total ADHD subscale. In contrast, none of the ADHD subscales were significantly related to Mexican orientation, which is consistent with our predictions.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting and as predicted, acculturation (i.e., neither Anglo nor Mexican orientation) was not significantly correlated with subscales of functional impairment (e.g., learning and peer problems) as measured by the Spanish Conners-3. The current results provide further support for initial findings suggesting that focusing on <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptomatology may not be as culturally sensitive as assessing for functional impairment associated with ADHD, particularly when examining hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427396">Arcia &amp; Fernández, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427396">Bauermeister et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the administration of a culturally appropriate and comprehensive measure of functional impairment across multiple domains, including academic, social, and familial, may be critical when assessing ADHD in Latino youth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1087054711427396">
<title>Diagnostic Utility</title>
<p>Although preliminary given the nature of the current sample, the results related to the diagnostic utility of the DBD-S are perhaps the most interesting. Based on the limited research available examining cultural differences in parental schemas for ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427396">Arcia &amp; Fernández, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427396">Bauermeister et al., 2005</xref>), it was predicted that the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms would not yield high diagnostic utility. Interestingly, this prediction was only supported when examining the hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. In general, the inattentive symptoms demonstrated moderately strong diagnostic utility for predicting both the presence and absence of ADHD. Two symptoms in particular (i.e., “often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly” and “often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities”) emerged as potential inclusion criteria given that the presence of these symptoms almost guaranteed a diagnosis of ADHD. An additional four inattentive symptoms (i.e., “often is easily distracted,” “often fails to give close attention to details,” “often has difficulty sustaining attention,” and “often loses things”) emerged as potential exclusion criteria, as the absence of these symptoms indicated a greater likelihood of the absence of ADHD.</p>
<p>Although the predictive power of the inattentive symptoms was better than expected, it is considerably lower than previous reports for predominately Caucasian samples. For example, in their examination of the diagnostic utility of the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> ADHD symptoms in a clinical sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711427396">Frick et al. (1994)</xref> reported a range of 0.55 to 0.78 and a mean of .69 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.56) for the PPP of inattentive symptoms compared with a range of 0.31 to 1.00 and a mean of .51 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.22) that emerged for the current sample. Similarly, Frick et al. reported a range of 0.59 to 0.97 with a mean of .76 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.74) for the NPP of inattentive symptoms compared with a range of 0.14 to 0.63 and a mean of .49 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.16) for the current sample.</p>
<p>The results for the hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were even more striking. With one exception for NPP (i.e., “often has difficulty awaiting turn”), the hyperactive-impulsive symptoms had much lower diagnostic utility than the inattentive symptoms in predicting both the presence and absence of ADHD in a community sample of Latino children. The predictive power of these symptoms is also much lower than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711427396">Frick et al. (1994)</xref>. Specifically, in the current sample, the PPP of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms ranged from 0.03 to 0.45 with a mean of .31 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.17) compared with a range of 0.48 to 0.88 and a mean of .73 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.52) for a predominately Caucasian sample. Similarly, the NPP of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms for the current sample ranged from 0.09 to 0.62 with a mean of .34 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.17) relative to a range of 0.51 to 0.85 and a mean of .65 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.51) for Frick et al.’s sample.</p>
<p>The generally low numbers that emerged for the NPP of these symptoms are particularly interesting, as they suggest that many Latino parents in the current sample view hyperactive-impulsive behaviors as developmentally normative. The failure of these symptoms to provide diagnostically useful information also is consistent with the acculturation findings that emerged in the current study, providing additional evidence that these symptoms may be culturally biased. Although these findings are preliminary and in need of replication with a clinical sample, they are consistent with the theoretical literature. Given the collectivist nature of Latino culture, it has been theorized that this particular worldview would likely be related to Latino parents being more accepting of their children’s behavior and less likely to identify externalizing behaviors, such as hyperactive-impulsive behaviors, as problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1087054711427396">Schmitz &amp; Velez, 2003</xref>). However, to our knowledge, the current findings provide the first empirical evidence to support the theoretical literature. Together, the acculturation and diagnostic utility findings also provide support for the argument that a culturally appropriate ADHD assessment must include a measure of functional impairment in addition to a measure of ADHD symptomatology, especially when the child is displaying hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Interestingly, even in the context of working with Caucasian families, others also have argued that a measure of functional impairment in addition to a measure of symptomatology would likely improve our predictive power when diagnosing ADHD and is necessary for appropriate treatment planning and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711427396">Owens &amp; Hoza, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711427396">Pelham et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1087054711427396">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although the current study adds to our understanding of providing culturally appropriate assessments for childhood ADHD, several limitations could be improved on in future work. Our sample of Latino parents was rather homogeneous. In addition to being predominately female and of Mexican descent, more than half of the participants had a high school education or less and had a family income below the poverty level. In addition, less than a quarter of the participants reported that they were bilingual and more than a third of them reported that they spoke no English. Examining a more diverse Latino sample in terms of gender and subgroups, as well as socioeconomic status and acculturation, would provide additional insight into which Latino families would benefit the most from a more culturally sensitive assessment. Future work with a clinical sample examining concurrent teacher reports on the DBD-S, as well as the structured interview that accompanies the DBD (i.e., the DBD Structured Interview; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711427396">Pelham, 2002</xref>), is also recommended, especially with regard to replicating the diagnostic utility findings. As discussed previously, based on research with predominately Caucasian families, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711427396">Pelham et al. (2005)</xref> argued that a structured interview adds little diagnostic utility beyond parent- and teacher-rating scales; however, it may prove to be more useful with certain groups, such as less acculturated Latino families.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1087054711427396">
<title>Clinical Implications and Future Directions</title>
<p>In closing, the current study has important clinical implications with regard to providing culturally appropriate assessments for ADHD and other childhood mental health disorders. Research documenting the disparity between need and utilization of mental health services for Latinos is clear, as is research providing recommendations for culturally appropriate assessments and interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427396">Callejas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427396">Flores et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711427396">Garland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711427396">Hough et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711427396">Kataoka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1087054711427396">Rowland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1087054711427396">Woods et al., 2005</xref>); however, much work remains. The current findings highlight the potential problems of translating already existing measures with the intent of providing a culturally sensitive assessment and the importance of examining not only the psychometric properties of these translated measures, but also the cultural properties and diagnostic utility when appropriate. Perhaps, most importantly, the current study provides further evidence that our overemphasis on <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptomatology may be particularly problematic when working with some Latino families, particularly those who are less acculturated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427396">Arcia &amp; Fernández, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427396">Bauermeister et al., 2005</xref>), and highlights the need for assessing parental acculturation as part of the ADHD assessment process when working with Latino families. Furthermore, although culturally appropriate measures of functional impairment in specific domains are beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711427396">Haack, Gerdes, Schneider, et al., 2011</xref>), a culturally appropriate and comprehensive measure of functional impairment tapping multiple domains related to childhood ADHD needs to be developed or an existing measure (e.g., the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale–Parent Report; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1087054711427396">Weiss, 2010</xref>) needs to be translated and examined for its psychometric and cultural properties. We argue that the addition of such a measure to an ADHD assessment would improve the cultural appropriateness of the assessment and would allow for the examination of clinically meaningful change in impairment following treatment.</p>

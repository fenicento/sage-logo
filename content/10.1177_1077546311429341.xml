<abstract>
<p>Based on the fuzzy Lyapunov method, this work addresses the stability conditions for nonlinear systems with multiple time delays to ensure the stability of building structure control systems. The delay independent conditions are derived via the traditional Lyapunov and fuzzy Lyapunov methods for multiple time-delay systems as approximated by the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The fuzzy Lyapunov function is defined as a fuzzy blending of quadratic Lyapunov functions. A parallel distributed compensation scheme is utilized to construct a global fuzzy logic control (FLC) by blending all linear local state feedback controllers in the controller design procedure. Furthermore, the H infinity performance and robustness of the design for modeling errors also need to be considered in the stability conditions. In order to generalize in practical controlled systems, this controller design problem is reduced to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem by use of the Schur Complements. Efficient interior-point algorithms are now available in the Matlab toolbox to solve this type of problem. The simulation results show in an easy to check fashion the feasibility of the independent criterion of the proposed FLC design method based on LMIs.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1077546311429341" sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The problem of the stabilization of time-delayed systems has often been explored in recent years. Time delays are common in engineering processes. They frequently arise in chemical processes, in long transmission lines and in pneumatic, hydraulic and rolling mill systems. The problem of stability analysis in time-delayed systems has been one of the main concerns of research into the attributes of such systems. Many works on this subject have been published. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1077546311429341">Hong and Hughes (2001)</xref> stated that the effects of such time delays on the performance, or even the stability, of such closed-loop control systems were especially important for lightly damped vibratory responses. This current study focuses on the time-delayed rate feedback control of a lightly damped single-degree-of-freedom (d.f.) harmonic oscillator. Even though this situation is relatively simple, it possesses a lot of interesting characteristics and must be treated carefully. Root loci were analyzed to provide a basis for stability conditions, and stability boundaries were plotted, correcting the results derived many years ago. How to extend these results from one structural mode to an arbitrary number of structural modes is explained.</p>
<p>In the same year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-1077546311429341">Vahidi and Eskandarian (2001)</xref> proposed a predictive control methodology for active vehicle suspension control, taking into account the effect of the time delay as an inherent characteristic of active systems in the absence of preview information. In this method, at each time instant, the control signal was calculated by minimizing a performance index, based on the predicted response in a finite prediction horizon. The discrete predictive approach, compared with the widely used linear quadratic regulator method, is easier to formulate and results in a discrete-time control simulation suitable for digital control, and time delays can be more easily introduced in the formulation. In this study, the predictive control simulation results were compared with passive control results. It is shown that this method is capable of improving the ride performance of a single-degree-of-freedom quarter-car model for a wide range of input frequencies in the presence of a time delay, at the same time maintaining the maximum suspension travel below the maximum of passively controlled suspensions.</p>
<p>In the following year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr181-1077546311429341">Wang and Xu (2002)</xref>, studied the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of Hopfield neural networks with interneuron transmission delays. Some sufficient stability conditions related to the existence of a unique equilibrium point and its global asymptotic stability were derived.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1077546311429341">Marzbanrad et al. (2002)</xref> studied optimal preview control of a vehicle suspension system traveling on a rough road. They used a three-dimensional seven d.f. car-ride model and several descriptions of the road surface roughness, including haversine (hole/bump) and stochastic filtered white noise models in their analysis. It is assumed that there are contactless sensors affixed to the vehicle front bumper to measure the road surface height at some distances in the front of the car. The suspension systems were optimized with respect to ride comfort and road holding preferences including acceleration of the sprung mass, tire deflection, suspension rattle space and control force. The performance and power demand of the active, active and delay, active and preview systems were evaluated and were compared with those for the passive system. The results showed that the optimal preview control improves all aspects of the vehicle suspension performance while requiring less power. The effects of variation of preview time and variations in the road condition are also examined in this study.</p>
<p>In 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1077546311429341">Marzban and Razzaghi (2005)</xref> presented a method for finding the solution of time-delay systems using a hybrid function. They presented the properties of the hybrid functions, which comprise block-pulse functions plus Taylor series. The method was based upon expanding various time functions in the system to serve as their truncated hybrid functions. Operational matrices of integration and delay were presented and were utilized to reduce the solution of time-delay systems to the solution of algebraic equations. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique in this article.</p>
<p>In the following year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311429341">Cai and Yang (2006)</xref> asserted that time delay inevitably exists in active control systems. It may cause unsynchronized control forces that can not only degrade the performance of the control systems, but also induce instability in the dynamic systems. In this work, an active vibration controller (with time delay) for a flexible cantilever beam is studied and a method for treating the time delay was proposed. The dynamic equation of the control mode with time delay was first presented using the independent modal space control, and is then discretized and transformed into the standard discrete forms with no explicit time delays by augmenting the state variables. The continuous performance index was also transformed into a discrete form. Then a discrete optimal control algorithm was designed based on the augmented state system. No approximations or assumptions are made in the derivation of the control algorithm, system stability is guaranteed. Furthermore, the method for the extraction of modal coordinates from actual physical measurements and the conversion to the actual control force from the modal one are presented. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed control algorithm were demonstrated by numerical simulation studies, which indicated that the vibration of the beam may be significantly suppressed using the proposed control algorithm. Instability may occur if the time delays were neglected in the control design.</p>
<p>A shifted Chebyshev series approach for solving the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model based time-delay dynamic equations (TSFMTDE) was later developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1077546311429341">Hsu and Chou (2007)</xref>. The new method simplified the procedure of solving the TSFMTDE into the solution of the systems of recursive formulae involving only matrix algebra. An algorithm based on these recursive formulae, and including only straightforward algebraic computation was also proposed. The new approach was non-iterative, non-differential, non-integral, straightforward, and well-adapted to computer implementation. Two numerical examples were provided. The first showed that the proposed method, which is based on the shifted Chebyshev series, may yield close-to-exact solutions. The second (a nonlinear mass-spring-damper mechanical time-delay system with a fuzzy parallel-distributed-compensation controller) demonstrated the application of the proposed approach.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1077546311429341">Lu et al. (2009)</xref> developed a method whereby the time-delay discrete-time equations were derived directly from the differential vibration equations for structures in the state space, with discrete parameters obtained via the precise integration method. A state vector expansion method is then used to transform these equations into ones which do not contain the time-delay terms explicitly. Next, the orders of this system were substantially reduced by using the balanced reduction method to form a dominant subsystem which was based on the eigenmodes of the state subspace with the highest controllability. The controllers were then designed by the discrete time-delay optimal control theory, which contains the control terms not only of the current state but also of a few previous states, to reflect the effect of the time delays. By using the proposed approach, the order of the controller was very substantially reduced without causing any essential difference in the control effect. A numerical example for a shear-type building was presented and it shows the effectiveness of the proposed method even when time delays were quite large.</p>
<p>In the same year, there were also five other papers presenting the time-delay issue in the <italic>Journal of Vibration and Control</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1077546311429341">Karkoub (2009)</xref> dealt with the robust control of lateral movement of webs using pivoting guiders. Lateral shifting is generally caused either by changes in the physical properties of the materials being processed, or by variations of the mechanical conditions of the machine. The lateral motion of a web system was usually ignored; however, to achieve high productivity and improve the product quality, the lateral position had to be controlled. The theoretical model presented in this paper was based on the assumption that the moving web is a beam with a very small, but finite, thickness. This leads to a sixth-order transfer function with the time delay. The time delays were the result of the non-colocation of the sensor and actuator. Because there are many sources of errors, a robust control technique was used to control the lateral web shifting. Several controllers were synthesized using the mu-synthesis control design technique, accounting for modeling imperfections as well as the time delay. Robust performance was achieved with the designed controllers and the closed-loop response was acceptable, even under extreme conditions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr179-1077546311429341">Wang and Wang (2009)</xref> considered the global exponential robust stability analysis problem for a class of uncertain distributed parameter control systems with time-varying delays. The uncertain parameters are generated from modeling errors as well as parameter variations in the control systems. The purpose of the problem addressed is to derive some easy-to-test conditions such that the dynamics of the uncertain system are globally exponentially robustly stable. By employing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to establish the desired sufficient conditions. As a consequence global exponential robust stability for uncertain distributed parameter control systems with time-varying delays can be easily checked by utilizing the numerically efficient Matlab LMI toolbox. A numerical example is used to show the usefulness of the derived LMI-based stability conditions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1077546311429341">Li et al. (2009)</xref> developed a stochastic averaging technique for resonant and non-resonant quasi linear systems subject to multi-time-delayed feedback control and wide-band random excitation. The technique is then applied to predict the response of one and two d.f. linear oscillators with nonlinear damping subject to wide-band random excitations and multi-time-delayed feedback control. It is shown through comparison with the results from a Monte Carlo simulation that the proposed technique yields quite good results, even for a case with a long delay time, and that the time-delayed feedback control may result in phenomenological bifurcation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr183-1077546311429341">Xuan et al. (2009)</xref> designed a magnetic bearing system for the suppression of rotor vibration. The magnetic bearing is able to support the shaft without mechanical contacts, and is also able to control the rotational vibration. The magnetic bearing is composed of position sensors, a digital controller, actuating amplifiers, and electromagnets. In order to reduce the vibration of a magnetic bearing system effectively, time-delay control (TDC) is utilized. It is suggested that in the design of an optimal controller, when the system has uncertainty, i.e., it has difficulty in extracting the exact mathematical expressions, it also has external disturbances. The observer with the position information is employed as a feedback signal for regulating the rotor whirling motion. A simulation is first performed to check the validity of the proposed controller in suppressing the rotor whirling. Experiments are then performed to guarantee its usefulness in the rotor rig with a magnetic actuator. The suppression of vibration is confirmed with TDC and its effect is compared with that of the proportional and derivative controllers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077546311429341">Chen and Cai (2009a)</xref> studied active control of a flexible cantilever beam with multiple time delays. They designed a controller using a discrete optimal control method with piezoelectric patches used as actuators. The state equation for the control modes with multiple time delays in the system is first obtained using modal orthogonality. Then, the state equation is discretized and transformed into the standard form without any explicit time delays by a particular augmenting for the state variables. A continuous performance index is also discretized into a standard discrete formulation that is a function of the augmented states. Therefore, the discrete controller may be designed based on the augmented system. Every step of the computation for the controller contains not only the current step of the state feedback, but also a linear combination of some former control steps. The simulation results indicate that the system may suffer from instability at a small time delay if it is not treated. It may be well compensated for by the proposed controller and good control may be obtained simultaneously. In addition, the proposed controller may possibly offer more effective control than the one with no time delay.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077546311429341">Chen et al. (2009)</xref> combined a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model approach with a parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme for the time-delay control of the response of a tension leg platform (TLP) system subjected to an external wave force. A global PDC-based fuzzy logic controller is constructed by blending all local state feedback controllers. A fuzzy-model-based control is thereby developed which can attenuate the influence of the external wave force. The controller is evaluated in terms of stability analysis, and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions guaranteeing the stability of the TLP system are derived using Lyapunov theory. A simulation example is given to show the feasibility of the proposed fuzzy control approach. The example shows that the concept of a half-circle fuzzy number can be used in fuzzy control and the proposed control method can be employed in the practical engineering problems involved in the construction of oceanic structures.</p>
<p>Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-1077546311429341">Tan et al. (2010)</xref> proposed the H infinity information control method for structural vibration suppression with control delay within a discrete-time framework. First, the continuous-time system equation with control delay is discretized using the precise computation of matrix exponentials. By introducing an appropriate extended state vector, the time-delay system is transformed into standard discrete formulations without time delays. Then a controller is designed in terms of the discrete time H (infinity) full information control theory. The controller comprised a regular feedback closed-loop and a feed-forward compensator which employed external excitation signals measured in real time. The feed-forward plus feedback controller had better performance than feedback only controllers. The feedback loop of the deduced controller consists of linear combinations of former control inputs besides the current state feedback terms. Thus, the proposed approach was applicable to large time-delay cases. Considering the complexity of the transformed system, a 2(N) algorithm is introduced to seek into the optimal attenuation level and discuss the control law. The present algorithm can be executed in parallel, which makes the design of H infinity controllers very convenient. Finally, numerical simulations of a three-story structure control are implemented. Time-delay effects on the optimal attenuation level were given to show that it was an important factor for system stability. Simulation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control method.</p>
<p>In the same year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1077546311429341">Kuske (2010)</xref> studied the combined effect of different noise sources on systems with delay. In a model for machine tool vibrations, specifically regenerative chatter, variation of material parameters or external (additive) noise can amplify vibrations via the well-known coherence resonance, while random variation of delay can suppress these vibrations. A key feature was the interplay of the noise with several different inherent time scales in this system: the short period of the intrinsic oscillations, the long time scale of their envelope, and the intermediate time intervals for the variation of the time delays. Optimizing the suppression of vibrations depends on understanding how these time scales and the bifurcation structure influence the combined effect of the noise sources. Furthermore, this multiple-scale viewpoint provides predictions for related types of stochastic dynamics in other systems with time delays.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr188-1077546311429341">Yi et al., (2010)</xref> considered the problem of feedback controller design via eigenvalue assignment for linear time-invariant systems of linear delay differential equations (DDEs) with a single time delay. Unlike ordinary differential equations (ODEs), DDEs have an infinite eigenspectrum, and it was not feasible to assign all closed-loop eigenvalues. However, it was possible to assign a critical subset of them using a solution to linear systems of DDEs in terms of the matrix Lambert W function. The solution has an analytical form expressed based on the parameters of the DDE, and was similar to the state transition matrix in linear ODEs. Hence, one can extend controller design methods developed based upon the solution forms of systems of ODEs to systems of DDEs, including the design of feedback controllers by eigenvalue assignment. The approach is presented and illustrated using some examples, and then compared with other existing methods.</p>
<p>In 2010, there were also some successful applications in time delay systems. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1077546311429341">Deshmukh (2010)</xref> proposed a method for approximate stability analysis of nonlinear delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs) with periodic coefficients with a geometric interpretation of evolution of the linearized system. First, a numerical algorithm based on direct integration by expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials is derived for linear analysis. The proposed algorithm is shown to have deeper connections and is computationally less cumbersome than the solutions of the underlying semi-explicit systems obtained from a similarity transformation.</p>
<p>A closed-form calculation was also presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1077546311429341">Robert and Gabor (2010)</xref> for the analysis of period-doubling bifurcation in the time-periodic delay-differential equation models of interrupted machining processes such as milling, in which the nonlinearity is essentially nonsymmetric. They proved the subcritical sense of this period-doubling bifurcation and approximate the emerging period-two oscillations using the Lyapunov-Perron method for computing the center manifold and by calculating the Poincare-Lyapunov constant of the bifurcation analytically at certain characteristic parameter values. The existence of the unstable period-two oscillations around the stable stationary cutting was confirmed using a numericalcontinuation algorithm for time-periodic delay-differential equations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311429341">Abdel-Rohman et al. (2010)</xref> stated that, in order to increase the critical wind speed to avoid the vibrations of flexible suspension bridges, it is necessary to introduce additional damping. One feasible method for introducing additional damping to suspension bridges is to use the semi-active tuned mass damper control mechanisms. Determining the time delay for generating the active control action due to the actuator’s dynamics is, however, a major practical problem which may destabilize the semi-active controlled structure. In this study, the effect of the time delay on the stability of a semi-active controlled suspension bridge is investigated. It is shown that when the time delay for the semi-active controlled suspension bridge is considered, the critical wind speed should be less than that determined when the time delays were neglected. The reduction in the critical wind speed due to the time delays might cause the suspension bridge to gallop at normal wind speeds. The paper showed how to compensate for the time delay effect to ensure the galloping suppression. The time delays compensation were treated by two methods: the first method expresses the delayed control action using a truncated Taylor’s series based on the current control action and its derivatives; the second method expresses the delayed control action as the feedback of the delayed state variables. Both approaches are applied on a linear model derived from the actual nonlinear model. The controlled response considering the time delay is obtained by applying the designed active control on the actual nonlinear model. The results of both methods of time delays’ compensation were discussed and compared using a numerical example.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1077546311429341">Han et al. (2010)</xref> also studied the effect of parameter mismatch on lag synchronization of chaotic systems with time delay in the framework of a master–slave configuration. It is shown that lag synchronization ofcoupled systems may be weak in the presence of small parameter mismatches. The error bound of lag-synchronization arising from the parameter mismatches was also estimated by rigorous theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations on a Lu oscillator are presented to verify the theoretical results.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077546311429341">Chen (2010)</xref> presented a fuzzy robust control design which combines H infinity control performance with T-S fuzzy control for the control of delayed nonlinear structural systems under external excitations. He designed a nonlinear fuzzy controller based on parallel distributed compensation schemes. The controller design problem isreformulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem as derived from the Lyapunov theory. This robust method is designed to overcome the modeling error that can occur between delayed nonlinear structural systems with T-S fuzzy models. Given the fuzzy-model-based H infinity control and the stability conditions, the stability of a delayed nonlinear structuralsystem under external excitation is ensured. Furthermore, the delayed nonlinear structural system is equipped with a tuned mass damper designed according to the first mode of frequency. The feedback gain of the fuzzy controller is found using the Matlab LMI toolbox. The proposed method is then applied to a delayed nonlinearly tuned mass damper system. The simulation results show that not only is the proposed method able to stabilize delayed nonlinear structural systems, but also has strong robustness in terms of preventing modeling errors and external excitations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1077546311429341">Pai (2010)</xref> presented a proportional-integral sliding mode control (PISMC) methodology for the robust control of vibration in a linear uncertain control system with state and input time delays. The systems were assumed to have structured, unmatched and time-varying parameter uncertainties. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and linear matrix inequality (LMI) H infinity technique, the sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the global stability of the dynamics and achieve a prescribed H infinity norm bound of disturbance attenuation for all admissible uncertainties without the state predictors. Furthermore, the scheme assures robustness against state delays, input delays, parameter uncertainties and disturbances simultaneously. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control methodology.</p>
<p>In 2011, Mao and Wang also presented a delay-dependent control design for a time-delay supercavitating vehicle model. By extending a widely cited benchmark model on the pitch-plane dynamics of a supercavitating vehicle, several new models have been proposed that include the memory effect for characterizing the interaction of the vehicle and the cavity. Based on this time-delay supercavitating vehicle model, we develop delay-dependent control designs that explicitly address the cavity memory effect in the supercavitating vehicle dynamics. The pitch-plane dynamics of the vehicle are first reformulated as a time-delay quasi-linear-parameter-varying system, and then delay-dependent H infinity controllers are developed. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance and robustness of the proposed delay-dependent controllers for both initial and tracking responses.</p>
<p>In the same year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr180-1077546311429341">Wang and Wang (2011)</xref> considered global exponential stabilization for a class of distributed parameter control systems with Markovian jumping parameters and time-varying delay. By utilizing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to establish some easy-to-check criteria for global exponential stabilization in the mean square for the stochastic systems. A numerical example is used to show the usefulness of the derived LMI-based stabilization conditions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr189-1077546311429341">Yoshimura (2011)</xref> was concerned with discrete-time adaptive sliding mode control for a class of uncertain time-delay systems. It was assumed that the dynamic systems were described by a discrete-time time-delay state equation with mismatched uncertainties, and that the states were measured with contamination with independent random noise. The augmented state equations are derived based on the state of the time delay, and the weighted extended Kalman filter and the weighted least squares estimator are proposed as a means to make the estimates for augmented states and uncertainties. The discrete-time adaptive sliding mode control is designed using the integral-type sliding surface and the output information obtained from the estimators. It was verified that the estimation errors converge to zero as time increases, and the states for the dynamic systems were ultimately bounded under the action of the proposed adaptive sliding mode control. The effectiveness of the proposed method was indicated by the simulation experiment in a simple numerical example.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-1077546311429341">Song and Sun (2011)</xref> extended their earlier work on continuous-time approximation of time-delayed dynamical systems by introducing a lowpass filter-based approach. The proposed method substantially improved the accuracy of predictions in frequency as well as time domain. It was applicable to linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, and can be readily incorporated with real-time controls. In this work, they first reviewed the mathematics literature on numerical methods for delayed differential equations including the equivalent abstract Cauchy problem. They show that the mathematics work to provide a solid foundation for several well-studied numerical methods for the time-delayed dynamical systems in the engineering literature. Examples are presented to show the accuracy of the pole prediction for linear systems, and temporal responses for both linear and nonlinear systems. Furthermore, they discussed the bandwidth issue of the method, and demonstrated that many extraneous poles introduced by the discrete approximation of the time-delayed system that do not match any exact poles of the system were still very important and contribute to the accuracy of temporal responses.</p>
<p>However, this current work focuses on two slightly different issues. First of all, most of the results reported above deal with the stability analysis based on T-S fuzzy systems, rather than nonlinear systems. Restated, the T-S fuzzy model is adopted to represent practical nonlinear systems and controllers designed only for fuzzy systems. The effect of modeling errors between nonlinear systems and T-S fuzzy models is not addressed even though this modeling error might influence the performance of the controlled systems. The other issue is the extension of the Lyapunov functions for stability issues in T-S type systems, which is necessary in order to avoid conservatism of stability and stabilization problems. Increasing attention is being paid to multiple Lyapunov functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-1077546311429341">Tanaka et al<italic>.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1077546311429341">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1077546311429341">El-Farra et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, in this investigation, we seek to develop a fuzzy Lyapunov approach for the stability analysis of nonlinear systems subjected to external disturbances. To derive a stability condition, the fuzzy Lyapunov approach is extended to the stability analysis of time-delay T-S fuzzy systems by applying the linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory.

This is a generalization of the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-1077546311429341">Tanaka et al. (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1077546311429341">2003</xref>). Then, based on the criteria given in this work, we develop a PDC control design with <inline-formula id="ilm2-1077546311429341"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-1077546311429341"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> disturbance attenuation performance designed to stabilize the time-delay T-S fuzzy systems.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, T-S fuzzy modeling for analysis of the stability of a time-delay system is briefly reviewed, and the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme is utilized to construct a global fuzzy logic controller. The concept of robustness stability is proposed to overcome the modeling error, and LMI is employed to derive the stability conditions. The control performance of the <inline-formula id="ilm3-1077546311429341"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-1077546311429341"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> robust control is discussed and the delay-dependent stability conditions derived using single Lyapunov functions. To avoid conservation, fuzzy Lyapunov functions are proposed as a way to extend the stability analysis of time-delay T-S fuzzy systems. The controller design problem is reformulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. Finally, a numerical example of a nonlinear structural system with time delays is givento demonstrate the results, and conclusions are drawn.</p>

The E-W component of the Taiwan Chi Chi earthquake record in 1999, scaled to a maximum ground acceleration of 1g, is used as the input excitation, with a duration of 35 seconds. The structure is first equipped with a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) to reduce the response to the external force. The mass, stiffness, and damping ratio of the floor are 5184 kg, 560,000 nt/m, and 0.02, respectively. Similarly, the natural frequency of control with TMD is <inline-formula id="ilm95-1077546311429341"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math95-1077546311429341"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo/><mml:mo>[</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtable align="left"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mrow><mml:mo/><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo/><mml:mo>[</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtable align="left"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>66</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>77</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mrow><mml:mo/><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

<p>Therefore, according to Theorem 1, the structural system with the TMD equipped subjected to an earthquake is guaranteed to be UUB stabilized. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311429341">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311429341">3</xref> indicate that the UUB stability of the primary structural system and tuned mass damper are ensured. This happens because the responses are appropriately controlled under earthquake excitation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311429341">Figure 4</xref> displays the time histories of the response quantities of the control force.

In this study we address a fuzzy Lyapunov method for the stability analysis of multiple time-delay nonlinear systems subject to external disturbances. A T-S fuzzy model and parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme are first employed to design a nonlinear fuzzy controller for the stabilization of multiple time-delay nonlinear systems. According to the controlled system, the <inline-formula id="ilm111-1077546311429341"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math111-1077546311429341"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> criterion is derived based on the fuzzy Lyapunov method, which is defined in terms of fuzzy blending quadratic Lyapunov functions. Based on the stability criterion, the multiple time-delay nonlinear systems are guaranteed to be stable. The control problem can then be reformulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. A simulation is provided to explore the feasibility of the proposed fuzzy controller design method.</p>

<abstract>
<p>The ability to match individual patients to tailored treatments has the potential to greatly improve outcomes for individuals suffering from major depression. In particular, while the vast majority of antidepressant treatments affect either serotonin or noradrenaline or a combination of these two neurotransmitters, it is not known whether there are particular patients or symptom profiles which respond preferentially to the potentiation of serotonin over noradrenaline or vice versa. Experimental medicine models suggest that the primary mode of action of these treatments may be to remediate negative biases in emotional processing. Such models may provide a useful framework for interrogating the specific actions of antidepressants. Here, we therefore review evidence from studies examining the effects of drugs which potentiate serotonin, noradrenaline or a combination of both neurotransmitters on emotional processing. These results suggest that antidepressants targeting serotonin and noradrenaline may have some specific actions on emotion and reward processing which could be used to improve tailoring of treatment or to understand the effects of dual-reuptake inhibition. Specifically, serotonin may be particularly important in alleviating distress symptoms, while noradrenaline may be especially relevant to anhedonia. The data reviewed here also suggest that noradrenergic-based treatments may have earlier effects on emotional memory that those which affect serotonin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Major depression is a relatively common psychiatric disorder, which is estimated to affect up to 7% of adults in a given year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269881112474523">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>). The disorder is associated with substantial morbidity and significant mortality, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that it will be the leading cause of disability worldwide by 2030. However, despite the pressing need for effective treatments, it is estimated that more than 50% of patients treated for major unipolar depression will not respond to first-line treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0269881112474523">Trivedi et al., 2006</xref>) and that furthermore, up to half of all patients will not reach an adequate therapeutic response even after a treatment switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0269881112474523">Rush et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The first antidepressant treatments were discovered by chance some 50 years ago when it was reported that patients treated for tuberculosis with iproniazid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0269881112474523">Loomer et al., 1957</xref>) and for psychosis with imipramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269881112474523">Kuhn, 1957</xref>) exhibited improvements in mood. These drugs were subsequently found to potentiate serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112474523">Glowinski and Axelrod, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0269881112474523">Ross and Renyi, 1969</xref>), and it was hypothesised that this in turn resulted in the antidepressant action of the drugs. In the half a decade that has passed since this initial serendipitous discovery a range of antidepressant drugs have been developed which, with few exceptions, act to enhance either 5-HT and/or NA neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Existing antidepressants have different profiles of action on the serotonin and noradrenaline systems, and recent meta-analyses have compared the overall efficacy of these different agents for the treatment of depression (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112474523">Bradley and Lenox-Smith, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0269881112474523">Papakostas et al., 2008</xref>). Trials that compare the efficacy of different antidepressants, no matter how powerful, are not, however, designed to interrogate the fine detail of individual differences in treatment response, and it is possible that these different antidepressants are particularly beneficial to different sub-groups of patients. Termed stratified medicine, this approach promotes matching individual patients to tailored treatments by assessing a number of criteria. In depression, it has been suggested that it will be necessary to consider a range of factors including sociodemographic factors, biological markers (for example neural changes and genetic variation) and differences in clinical presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0269881112474523">Simon and Perlis, 2010</xref>). One study has used this approach to compare the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine with those of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NRI) reboxetine in terms of resolution of specific symptoms. In fact, rather similar effects of both drugs were found following 8 weeks treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0269881112474523">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>). However, more recent data suggest that it is possible to differentiate between symptom response to drugs which primarily potentiate NA (here nortriptyline) and 5-HT (escitalopram), such that escitalopram is more effective in treating mood and cognitive symptoms while nortriptyline demonstrates greater efficacy in improving neurovegetative symptoms such as disturbed sleep and poor appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0269881112474523">Uher et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that patients with melancholic features do not respond well to citalopram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0269881112474523">McGrath et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A more detailed approach to understanding which patients will respond best to which treatments will require a more complete understanding of the links between neurotransmitters, neural circuits and specific symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0269881112474523">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, a better understanding of the specific psychological processes affected by serotonin versus noradrenaline may be an important first step in making these predictions. And yet, despite advances in our understanding of the neurochemical basis for antidepressant treatments, the means by which these treatments correct the psychological symptoms which characterise the disorders remain underspecified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009a</xref>). Attempts to model the very human symptoms of the disorder in animal models have not always met with success, and the questionable validity of such models may have hampered research in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0269881112474523">Nestler and Hyman, 2010</xref>). Human models linking psychological changes to changes in neuropharmacology in unison with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may facilitate a better understanding of the psychological mechanisms by which antidepressants exert their effects, and enable us to interrogate the effects of different treatments on specific aspects of the disorder and the neurocircuits underlying them.</p>
<p>Recent research on the early effects of antidepressants on emotional processing suggests that this aim may be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112474523">Elliott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0269881112474523">Pringle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0269881112474523">Roiser et al., 2012</xref>). The cognitive neuropsychological model places key emphasis on early antidepressant-induced changes in emotional processing, a term used to describe the cognitive processing, including perception, attention and memory, of emotionally salient information. Rapid resolution of negative affective bias in emotional processing is then proposed to underlie the eventual symptom improvement following antidepressant treatment. This model has the advantage of being amenable to use in healthy volunteers, offering potentially greater validity than animal models of depression. Models of emotional processing appear to be sensitive across antidepressant treatments with different pharmacological (and even non-pharmacological) actions, and thus can be used to interrogate a range of different compounds.</p>
<p>This review will therefore consider the consider the effects of antidepressants which potentiate serotonin and noradrenaline on emotional processing, with the goal of understanding whether the effects of serotonin and noradrenaline can be dissociated and whether there are additive effects of drug treatments which potentiate both neurotransmitters. In the main, the SSRI citalopram is compared with the NRI reboxetine as these are believed to be the most specific examples of their respective classes.</p>

<title>A cognitive neuropsychological model of antidepressant drug action</title>
<p>Although improved mood is the ultimate goal of antidepressant treatment, the view that these drugs directly affect mood is problematic since drugs that act directly to immediately improve mood are not effective as antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0269881112474523">Satel and Nelson, 1989</xref>) and antidepressant drugs do not have immediate effects on mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">2004</xref>). The cognitive neuropsychological model of antidepressant drug action therefore hypothesises that the direct action of antidepressant treatment is rather to remediate negative biases in emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112474523">Elliott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0269881112474523">Pringle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0269881112474523">Roiser et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of such negative affective biases is emphasised in cognitive accounts of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112474523">Beck et al., 1979</xref>). Negative biases are apparent in patients suffering from depression across a range of cognitive domains (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0269881112474523">Mathews and MacLeod, 2005</xref>). For example, in relation to the recognition of facial expressions of emotion, depressed patients have been reported to shown either deficits in the processing of positive emotions and/or increased processing of negative emotional expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112474523">Bouhuys et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112474523">Gur et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0269881112474523">Surguladze et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, depression has been associated with reduced positive and/or increased negative affective recall in emotional memory paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112474523">Bradley et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112474523">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>These changes in the information processing of affective stimuli are thought to be important in the maintenance of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112474523">Elliott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0269881112474523">Pringle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0269881112474523">Roiser et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study in depressed patients suggests that these negative biases are reversed by a single dose of antidepressant drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009b</xref>). Specifically depressed patients, prior to treatment, showed reduced recognition of facial emotional expressions of happiness, took longer to respond to self-referent adjectives and were worse at recalling these adjectives (an effect that was particularly marked in the case of positively valenced words), compared with healthy volunteers. These effects were reversed with an acute dose of the NRI reboxetine. Consistent with this, studies utilising fMRI have shown that aberrant neural responses to both positive and negative social stimuli in depressed patients are ameliorated following antidepressant drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112474523">Fu et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112474523">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0269881112474523">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0269881112474523">Sheline et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In itself, in the short term, the shift away from negatively biased emotional processing in response to antidepressant drug treatment does not have an impact on subjective mood. Instead, it is argued that over time and as a result of interaction with the social environment these changes in emotional processing subsequently result in improved mood. The need for interaction with the social environment is perhaps best exemplified by a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0269881112474523">MacLeod and colleagues (2002)</xref> in which it was demonstrated that an experimentally induced negative bias did not affect mood until participants were later exposed to a stressful situation. We have proposed that the need for time for patients to interact with their social environment explains the lag between changes in emotional processing, which are seen even after a single dose of an antidepressant, (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>) and the eventual mood change experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009a</xref>). This fits with clinical observations that there is lag of 2–4 weeks before symptomatic improvement following the start of drug treatment. In support of this hypothesis a recent study demonstrated a correlation between changes in emotional bias (emotional memory) following short-term treatment with citalopram and subsequent resilience to a negative mood induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, a study in depressed patients demonstrated an association between the ability to recognise happy emotional expressions in the early stages of antidepressant treatment and later clinical improvement in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0269881112474523">Tranter et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, this latter study provides preliminary evidence in line with the key prediction of the model, that early emotional processing could be important in the subsequent clinical responses. One interesting outstanding question is whether interaction with the social environment (and therefore a time lag in clinical effects) is strictly necessary for an antidepressant response. Particularly relevant to this question are recent data suggesting that drugs such as ketamine (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0269881112474523">Murrough et al., 2012</xref>) and scopolamine (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112474523">Drevets and Furey, 2010</xref>) can induce rapid remission in treatment-resistant patients with hours or days. Ketamine has been demonstrated to induce positive biases in emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112474523">Deakin et al., 2012</xref>), but it remains unclear how such psychological effects could become translated into clinical action so quickly according to the predictions made by this model. One possibility is that these drugs induce relatively larger positive shifts than do conventional antidepressants, such that less time to interact with the social environment is necessary to relearn associations. A second intriguing possibility is suggested by cross-translation work in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0269881112474523">Robinson, 2012</xref>) which suggests that ketamine affects emotional memory reconsolidation, such that it may be able to retrogradely interfere with existing emotional memories. Such a profile would be expected to have a quicker effect on subjective experience, since it does not rely on new incoming information but could effectively re-code previously negative associations and memory processes, leading to a quicker improvement in the symptoms of depression. Exploring the mechanisms of rapid- acting antidepressants and their implications for the cognition neuropsychological model of antidepressant drug action will be an important avenue of future research.</p>
<p>A key prediction of this model is that if antidepressant drug treatments remediate negative biases in emotional processing, then this effect should also be apparent in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0269881112474523">Roiser et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, a number of studies suggest that healthy volunteer models of emotional processing are sensitive to antidepressant drug treatment. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112474523">Harmer et al. (2009b)</xref> study described above, healthy volunteers, similar to the depressed patients, also had increased recognition of happy facial expressions and faster responses to positive versus negative self-referent adjectives under reboxetine. These results support the idea that healthy volunteer models of emotional processing can be used to understand the psychological processes important in antidepressant drug action. A large number of studies have now considered the effects of antidepressant drug treatments in healthy volunteer models of emotional processing across acute and sub-chronic (usually 7-day) treatment regimens. Drugs with diverse pharmacological mechanisms of action have been examined, for example the SSRI citalopram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">2004</xref>), the NRI reboxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">2004</xref>), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2008</xref>), tetracyclic mirtazapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112474523">Arnone et al., 2009</xref>) and the novel antidepressant and melatonin agonist agomelatine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2011b</xref>). Studies such as these enhance our understanding of the psychological mechanisms of action of these treatments, providing an explanation of the intermediate step between beginning treatment and eventual mood improvement.</p>
<p>A possible explanation of such effects could be that they are simply secondary to non-specific effects of the drugs such as changes in arousal. Three lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case. Firstly, non-specific effects are usually prospectively measured in these studies, and treatment is not usually associated with subjective changes in these measures. When subjective effects of acute antidepressants are found (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2008</xref>), these are usually associated with their side effects, but there is a clear dissociation between these unpleasant experiences and positive biases in emotional processing. Secondly, the effects seem to be relatively specific in that, as opposed to performance being generally improved or reduced, there are effects on some facial expressions of emotion but not others, and memory for positive as opposed to negative stimuli tends to be enhanced. Thirdly, in studies where arousal is manipulated using alternative drug treatments such as the wake-promoting agent modafinil, positive emotional biases are not typically induced (Pringle, unpublished).</p>
<p>Further validity for this model of antidepressant drug action comes from research demonstrating the directional sensitivity of the model. Work exploring the effects of the cannabinoid receptor antagonist rimonabant produced a negative bias in emotional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881112474523">Horder et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881112474523">2012</xref>). Interestingly, rimonabant was subsequently withdrawn from clinical use because of its propensity to increase rates of depression during routine treatment. The model is also sensitive to the differences in acute and sub-chronic treatment. For example clinically, some antidepressant drugs appear to increase anxiety in the first few days of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881112474523">Kent et al., 1998</xref>), and this is reflected in the model by increased startle and fear responses following an acute dose of citalopram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112474523">Grillon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003b</xref>), although the neural underpinnings of this remain uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269881112474523">Murphy, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, such effects are not seen in the model following an acute dose of the tetracyclic mirtazapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112474523">Arnone et al., 2009</xref>), which has been demonstrated to be effective in treating anxiety earlier in treatment.</p>
<p>The model also appears to be able to differentiate between those antidepressant treatments that are useful in treating anxious symptoms (for example citalopram) and those which are not (for example reboxetine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0269881112474523">Murphy et al., 2009</xref>), as well as identifying those treatments, such as diazepam, which appear to have effects on anxiety and fear processing rather than the symptoms of low mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0269881112474523">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, the sensitivity of the model is such that it has been possible to identify compounds which may not be effective in treating depression. The NK1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant, and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine produced only limited positive effects in our emotional processing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112474523">Chandra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0269881112474523">Pringle et al., 2012</xref>) consistent with randomised controlled trial data in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269881112474523">Keller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0269881112474523">Zarate et al., 2006</xref>). Critically, if such a model is to be a useful means of assessing antidepressant efficacy, then it must be sensitive to drugs of diverse pharmacological mechanisms rather than simply being sensitive to drugs which modulate 5-HT and NA. Studies exploring the effects of the novel antidepressant and melatonin agonist agomelatine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2011b</xref>) and the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112474523">Deakin et al., 2012</xref>), suggest that the model has the potential to detect antidepressants with novel pharmacological mechanisms. Taken together, this evidence suggests that a healthy volunteer model of emotional processing could be a useful and sensitive means by which to explore the effects of different antidepressant agents.</p>

<p>Preclinical and clinical studies support a role for monoamines in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112474523">Brozoski et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0269881112474523">Park et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0269881112474523">Riedel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0269881112474523">Schmitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0269881112474523">Zahrt et al., 1997</xref>) with an additional modulatory role for NA in emotional memory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881112474523">Hurlemann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0269881112474523">van Stegeren, 2008</xref> for recent reviews). Key studies in human and non-human animals suggest that NA is crucial in enhancing memory for items with emotional versus neutral content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0269881112474523">McGaugh, 2004</xref>). The model of noradrenergic modulation of emotional memory suggests that noradrenalin release from the locus coeruleus which projects to basolateral amygdala results in enhanced attention to and sensory processing of emotional stimuli at the level of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112474523">Cahill and McGaugh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0269881112474523">LeDoux, 2000</xref>). Biased processing in the amygdala has downstream effects on hippocampal activity such that neuronal processing is upregulated, an effect thought to be mediated via a beta-adrenergic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0269881112474523">McGaugh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This model is supported by a large body of experimental work including evidence that upregulating NA with yohimbine specifically enhances memory for emotional versus neutral items (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0269881112474523">O’Carroll et al., 1999b</xref>), and the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol which selectively impairs emotional versus neutral memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112474523">Cahill et al., 1994</xref>). It should be noted, however, that while the effects of propanalol on emotional memory have generally been replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0269881112474523">Maheu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0269881112474523">Reist et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0269881112474523">van Stegeren et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0269881112474523">2005</xref>), this is not always the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0269881112474523">O’Carroll et al., 1999a</xref>). Moreover, a study using this model with the NRI reboxetine, which would be predicted to enhance memory for an emotional material, in fact failed to find this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0269881112474523">Papps et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies from our laboratory have considered the effects of the NRI reboxetine on the encoding, recognition and recall of emotional material using a self-referent categorisation task. A study using a sub-chronic (7-day) dosing regimen in healthy volunteers resulted in a recall memory bias for the positive versus negative emotional personality characteristic words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>). Similar results have also been reported on recall memory following even a single dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>), and such findings generalise to depressed patients where a single dose of reboxetine was shown to speed responses to positive versus negative words at encoding and to enhance subsequent recall memory for positive items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009b</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112474523">Table 1</xref> for a summary of the effects of depression and antidepressant drugs on emotional processing).</p>

<p>It is usual to see an affective modulation of the startle response such that startle responses are greater to negative than to positive or neutral pictures, this affective modulation does not appear to be present in depressed patients; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112474523">Allen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112474523">Dichter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112474523">Forbes et al., 2005</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>At the neural level, 7 days of reboxetine treatment resulted in increased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus to positive versus negative stimuli during encoding, but reduced the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal to these stimuli during recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0269881112474523">Norbury et al., 2008</xref>). This effect can be interpreted as a bias towards the enhanced attentional processing of the emotional descriptors at encoding, resulting in reduced neural effort being required at recognition. Again, the data from single-dose studies are remarkably consistent, such that while there was no effect of reboxetine on the BOLD signal at encoding, the signal was reduced in a fronto-parietal network during subsequent recognition of positive versus matched distractor words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0269881112474523">Miskowiak et al., 2007</xref>). A second single-dose study measured brain activity only at encoding, finding that reboxetine increased hippocampal activity during the encoding of emotional versus neutral pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269881112474523">Kukolja et al., 2011</xref>). The contradictory findings at encoding in these two studies may be the result of important differences in the encoding paradigm used (self-referent vs. passive viewing task); however, both results are interpreted as in keeping with suggestion that potentiating NA may increase encoding efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269881112474523">Kukolja et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Why enhancing NA neurotransmission should specifically enhance the encoding and later retrieval of positive versus negative emotional items is puzzling in view of the original studies suggesting that potentiation of NA increases memory for aversive material (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0269881112474523">O’Carroll et al., 1999b</xref>). There are a number of conceivable explanations for these seemingly contradictory findings. First, it is possible that NA enhances memory for salient, arousing stimuli rather than specifically the consolidation of negative cues, and that in the self-referential paradigm positive descriptors are generally more meaningful. Indeed, a positive self-bias is generally seen in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881112474523">Heine et al., 1999</xref>). Countered against this, however, the inherent negative bias in depressed individuals is reversed following reboxetine treatment, suggesting that the amplification of an inherent bias cannot be the sole explanation of the effects of reboxetine on emotional memory.</p>
<p>It may also be that there are important differences in the neurobiological processes underlying performance in the paradigms used in these studies, since most of the original studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112474523">Cahill et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0269881112474523">Maheu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0269881112474523">Reist et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0269881112474523">van Stegeren et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0269881112474523">2005</xref>) have looked at emotional memory using a negative emotional story describing sad events happening to an external character, with memory recall being assessed in a drug-free state after a week or more. In contrast, those considering the effects of reboxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112474523">2009b</xref>) have used the self-referent categorisation task with immediate or short delayed recall during drug exposure.</p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies using this emotional categorisation task point to the importance of the prefrontal cortex (especially medial), anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus in performing this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112474523">Fossati et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0269881112474523">Miskowiak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0269881112474523">Norbury et al., 2008</xref>), possibly influenced by catecholamine activity which is known to underlie executive functions in frontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112474523">Arnsten, 1998</xref>). In contrast, the non-self-referent tasks where memory is assessed after a longer time delay appear to be more amygdala and hippocampus dependent, as would be expected in the classic model of the role of NA in emotional memory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112474523">Dolcos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0269881112474523">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0269881112474523">Strange and Dolan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As well as differences in the psychological paradigm, differences in the pharmacological properties of the drug manipulations used across studies could be important. With this in mind, it is interesting that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0269881112474523">Papps et al. (2002)</xref> also used the negative emotional story paradigm, and yet found that reboxetine dose dependently decreased rather than increased recognition memory for the negative story. Perhaps then differences in the pharmacological manipulations used in these quite different emotional memory paradigms may be responsible for these different findings. Further work will be needed to disentangle these possible explanations and to fully elucidate the effects of reboxetine in different aspects of emotional memory.</p>
<p>Pharmacological manipulations which decrease central serotonin neurotransmission have been shown to impair memory and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0269881112474523">Park et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0269881112474523">Riedel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0269881112474523">Schmitt et al., 2000</xref>), while increasing central serotonin neurotransmission with citalopram has been demonstrated to enhance long-term memory recognition and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2002</xref>). Studies examining the effects of citalopram on emotional memory suggested differential effects depending on dosing regimen. Following a single dose, citalopram does not appear to affect emotional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>), conversely a 7-day study found that, similar to reboxetine, citalopram increased the recall of positive versus negative items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>) and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A single dose of the SNRI duloxetine had no effect on the number of emotional words correctly recalled but did, however, increase the number of falsely remembered positive words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2008</xref>), indicative of a more general positive processing bias. In a neuroimaging study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0269881112474523">Tendolkar et al. (2011)</xref> considered the effects of 2-week duloxetine treatment on emotional memory in healthy volunteers who had undergone a sad mood induction. They found that duloxetine treatment decreased activity in a network of brain regions (putamen, middle frontal gyrus, middle and anterior cingulate cortex) during successful memory formation for mood-congruent and incongruent items. However, there was a specific enhancement of amygdala activity during successful recognition of mood-incongruent positive stimuli. This study is interesting not only because it because it provides further evidence to support the utility of an SNRI in reversing negative biases in memory, but also because, unlike previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0269881112474523">Miskowiak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0269881112474523">Norbury et al., 2008</xref>), it evaluates neural activity at encoding on the basis of successful retrieval, allowing the evaluation of effective encoding. This study suggests a plausible mechanism by which a drug which upregulates NA neurotransmission may have behavioural effects specifically at successful retrieval.</p>
<p>Although not directly tested, taken together these findings suggest that reboxetine may have earlier effects on emotional memory than citalopram, since single-dose studies in healthy and depressed volunteers suggest memory effects following a single dose of reboxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112474523">2009b</xref>), but not citalopram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>). A single dose of duloxetine also appears to confer a positive bias in emotional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2008</xref>), and it is interesting that the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine (which increases NA neurotransmission through presynaptic inhibitory alpha-2 autoreceptor blockade) also has positive acute effects on emotional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112474523">Arnone et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Emotional memory is thought to be a particularly important aspect of emotional processing relevant to depression, from both experimental data from depressed patients (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0269881112474523">Leppänen, 2006</xref>) and theoretical models of depression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112474523">Bower, 1981</xref>). Therefore the possibility that drugs which increase NA neurotransmission may have earlier effects in this domain than those which increase 5-HT is of interest. The self-referent memory paradigm employed in a number of the studies described above is especially pertinent to negative self-cognitions in depression, and it is known that the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is important in this type of task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0269881112474523">Northoff et al., 2006</xref>). As noted above, it is well established that catecholamine neurotransmission in this region is important in memory, and it may therefore be relevant that the novel antidepressant agomelatine which increases catecholamine activity in the PFC (via blockade of 5HT2c receptors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0269881112474523">Millan et al., 2003</xref>) also increases recall for positive versus negative items in this task following a 7-day treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>

<title>Facial expressions of emotion</title>
<p>Facial expressions of emotion are a relatively universal social signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112474523">Ekman, 1993</xref>), and a large body of evidence suggests that recognition of these emotional cues is impaired in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0269881112474523">Leppänen, 2006</xref>). Antidepressant drug treatment has been found to decrease the perception of negative facial expressions and/or increase the perception of positive cues early in treatment. For example, 7 days of treatment with reboxetine reduced the recognition of the negative emotions of fear and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>). Much of the neuroimaging work has focused on the amygdala as this structure appears to play a key role in processing emotion (and especially threat-related) stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269881112474523">Murphy, 2010</xref>), and consistent with the behavioural findings, 7 days of treatment has been found to reduce amygdala activity to fearful faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0269881112474523">Norbury et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0269881112474523">Norbury et al. (2007)</xref> also reported increased responses to covertly presented happy faces following reboxetine in the fusiform gyrus. This fits with findings suggesting that activity in this region in response to happy faces is reduced in depressed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0269881112474523">Surguladze et al., 2005</xref>) and that biased sensory processing in this area may function to modulate attention to emotional stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0269881112474523">Vuilleumier, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In keeping with this, a single dose of reboxetine can enhance the recognition of happy facial expressions at the behavioural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>). However, in another study a single dose of reboxetine was found to enhance the amygdala response to fearful versus neutral facial stimuli, though responses to positive stimuli were not assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0269881112474523">Onur et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that these divergent fMRI findings can be explained in terms of differences in length of dosing or in methodology, since Onur et al. used short movies, whereas the data from Norbury et al. were based on covertly presented stimuli. Yet these data in healthy volunteers are validated by studies in depressed individuals, where a single dose of reboxetine reversed the reduced perception of happy faces which was evident in the unmedicated depressed group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009b</xref>). Moreover, in a further study, depressed patients receiving citalopram or reboxetine showed enhanced processing of happy facial expressions after 2 weeks of treatment, and this was predictive of therapeutic response after a further 4 weeks of treatment. These data support the hypothesis that emotional processing changes may be involved in the therapeutic actions of antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0269881112474523">Tranter et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Treating healthy volunteers with citalopram for 7 days reduces the recognition of negative emotional faces (fear and anger) in a similar way to reboxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, short-term citalopram treatment has been shown to reduce amygdala activity to fearful faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2006</xref>) and to increase amygdala responses to happy faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0269881112474523">Norbury et al., 2009</xref>). Paradigms using longer dosing schedules corroborate these findings; for example, 12 days of citalopram reduced the amygdala response in a facial discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0269881112474523">Windischberger et al., 2010</xref>) and in depressed individuals 8 weeks of treatment similarly attenuates the amygdala response to negative fearful faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0269881112474523">Sheline et al., 2001</xref>). Paradoxically, however, a single dose of citalopram appears to enhance fear recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003b</xref>), an effect which has not been observed behaviourally with reboxetine or duloxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112474523">2008</xref>). It has been suggested that this early anxiogenic-like effect models the tendency of citalopram to increase anxiety and agitation at the start of treatment in various patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881112474523">Kent et al., 1998</xref>). Amygdala changes in response to acute doses of citalopram are less clear cut, as most studies have shown decreased amygdala response to fear, while others have shown increased responding (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269881112474523">Murphy, 2010</xref>). It is possible, however, that the nature of this effect is modulated by the SSRI dose (which varies between studies) and the sensitivity of the volunteers taking part in the study to these early anxiogenic-like effects.</p>
<p>Very few studies have considered the effects of SNRIs on emotional face processing, and therefore our understanding of their effects is less clear. Behaviourally, duloxetine has been demonstrated to increase both happy and disgust recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2008</xref>). Increased disgust recognition is difficult to fully explain, though it is possible that it can be explained as being mediated by the unpleasant side effects experienced in this study. A neuroimaging study found that 2 weeks of duloxetine treatment reduced neural responses to angry and fearful faces in extended amygdala circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0269881112474523">van Marle et al., 2011</xref>). Evidence from other antidepressants which potentiate NA, such as mirtazapine, also suggests decreases in fear processing after a single dose both behaviourally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112474523">Arnone et al., 2009</xref>) and at the level of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0269881112474523">Rawlings et al., 2010</xref>). It is interesting to note that agomelatine specifically reduced the processing of sad facial expressions, an effect which could be considered to be more specific to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2011b</xref>). These results may therefore have relevance for a phenomenon referred to as emotional blunting which may be experienced following antidepressant treatment, and which is discussed in a later section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results suggest that there are some key overlapping effects of citalopram and reboxetine on facial expression recognition. Both drugs have, for example, been demonstrated to reduce fear processing after 7 days of treatment. However, in a study which directly compared the effects of citalopram and reboxetine, citalopram appeared to have broader effects on the processing of negative facial stimuli, reducing the perception of disgust and the more ambiguous signal of surprise in addition to fear and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>). Also of note is the finding that, in contrast to acute-dose studies, longer-term dosing does not appear to directly increase perception of positive facial expressions; however, negative expressions rendered more ambiguous by lowering the intensity of the emotion (morphing with neutral expressions) tend to be more often interpreted as positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>). Although the findings from the neuroimaging work are less clear, there is evidence to suggest that acute administration of citalopram, but not reboxetine, decreases the amygdala signal to fear. Further studies are required to directly compare these effects using the same experimental set-up in healthy volunteers.</p>

<title>Dot-probe task and emotion-potentiated startle</title>
<p>Both the dot probe and emotion-potentiated startle are thought to relate more to anxiety-related processes and therefore to the potential anxiolytic properties of antidepressants, and the effects of citalopram and reboxetine appear to be quite divergent in these paradigms. Studies in anxious individuals suggest that anxiety is associated with attentional biases towards threat (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0269881112474523">Mogg and Bradley, 1998</xref>), which can be measured using the dot-probe task. The dot-probe task assesses the reaction time speed to detect a probe when it is in the same versus other location to a threatening stimulus, and can measure attentional vigilance for both overt and covert stimuli (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0269881112474523">MacLeod et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0269881112474523">Mogg et al., 1995</xref>). Studies employing the dot-probe task find that citalopram increases vigilance for positive versus negative stimuli following both a single dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>) and sub-chronic dosing schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0269881112474523">Murphy et al., 2009</xref>). This effect is not seen following treatment with reboxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0269881112474523">Murphy et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the emotion-potentiated startle, which can be conceptualised as the human analogue of the rodent fear-potentiated startle, reveals effects of citalopram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112474523">Grillon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>), but not of reboxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>). The effects of citalopram on the emotion-potentiated startle are similar to findings in the facial expression recognition task, in that startle reactivity is increased following acute doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112474523">Browning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112474523">Grillon et al., 2007</xref>), while repeated administration decreases responses in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>). This is again concordant with the clinical observation that this drug can initially increase anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881112474523">Kent et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together these findings suggest, in line with the known clinical utility of these drugs, that blocking 5-HT reuptake can be an effective strategy in treating anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112474523">Dhillon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881112474523">Kent et al., 1998</xref>). Reboxetine, by contrast, does not typically affect responses in the emotion-potentiated startle and dot-probe paradigms and is not widely prescribed for anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0269881112474523">NICE, 2007</xref>). It may be therefore that potentiation of 5-HT is important in relieving anxious symptoms, however, not exclusively, as evidence reveals reboxetine is effective in the treatment of some anxiety disorders and especially panic disorder (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0269881112474523">Seedat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0269881112474523">Versiani et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The single study that has considered the effects of an SNRI, duloxetine, on the emotion-potentiated startle found no effect of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2008</xref>). Thus further studies are required to assess the effects of duloxetine after continued administration and to directly compare with the effects produced by SSRIs such as citalopram. It is interesting to note, however, that studies considering the drugs mirtazapine and agomelatine did report reduced startle responses following treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112474523">Arnone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, these findings suggest, in line with clinical experience, that drugs which potentiate 5-HT are more useful in treating anxiety-like responses in neuropsychological paradigms than those which potentiate NA alone. Further research exploring whether drugs which have combined action on serotonin and noradrenaline systems have greater longer-term benefits in these models is required.</p>

<title>Summary and discussion</title>
<p>Overall, although antidepressants appear to have overlapping effects in these models, the findings reviewed here suggest that it may be possible to distinguish between the effects of serotoninergic and noradrenergic drugs on emotional processing. Specifically reboxetine seems to effect early processing of emotional memory without anxiogenic-like side effects, yet has a less profound or consistent reduction in negative affective processing compared with citalopram, especially with longer-term dosing. It should be noted, however, that differences between these agents have not been directly tested in many studies and so remain speculative. The dichotomy between relatively more beneficial effects on positive aspects of emotional processing (NA) and relatively more beneficial effects on negative aspects (5-HT) is in keeping with previous observations and hypotheses about the relationship between these classes of drugs and depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0269881112474523">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0269881112474523">Shelton and Tomarken, 2001</xref>). Conceptually, psychological research has suggested that affect can be divided into two factors, positive and negative, which are distinctive and uncorrelated, and subsume more fine-grained differential emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0269881112474523">Watson and Tellegen, 1985</xref>). It has previously been argued that depressive symptoms can be divided across these dimensions, such that they are split into symptoms reflecting a loss of positive affect (loss of pleasure/enjoyment, loss of motivation and energy, loss of interest) and those reflecting negative affect (guilt, irritability, fear, anxiety), with low mood and sadness being common to both groups of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0269881112474523">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>). Using this dichotomy of symptoms it is argued that catecholaminergic drugs such that potentiate dopamine (DA) and NA are more effective in treating the ‘loss of positive affect’ symptoms than serotonergic drugs, which may be more effective in managing more generalised distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0269881112474523">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0269881112474523">Shelton and Tomarken, 2001</xref>). The emotional processing findings reported here fit broadly within this model, such that citalopram appears to affect those aspects of emotion processing aligned with negative affect such as fear and anxiety, while the effects of reboxetine (as well as other drugs which potentiate catecholamines, including SNRIs) are perhaps more effective in modulating positive affect. At the neural level, a study from Brühl and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112474523">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112474523">2011</xref>) examining the effects of a single dose of citalopram, reboxetine or placebo on the anticipation and perception of emotional stimuli in healthy volunteers provides evidence for biologically divergent effects of these drugs on emotional processing. In this study reboxetine increased brain activity in the thalamus, dorsolateral prefrontal and occipital cortices, while citalopram primarily affected the prefrontal and insular cortices. The authors suggest that these findings are in keeping with the idea that citalopram may have more modulatory, cognitive control and cognitive-integration effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112474523">Fuster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0269881112474523">Mayberg, 2003</xref>), while the effects of reboxetine may primarily be to moderate afferent pathways which are sensitive to visceral input and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112474523">Aston-Jones et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112474523">Berridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0269881112474523">Vogt, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing a distinction between 5-HT modulation primarily having downregulating effects of negative processing and NA modulation having more prominent effects on the upregulation of positive processing, suggests that consideration of anhedonia and reward processing would prove useful in further characterising the effects of these two neurotransmitter systems in antidepressant treatment.</p>

<sec id="section8-0269881112474523">
<title>Anhedonia and reward</title>
<p>Anhedonia is defined as a lack of positive reactivity to, and interest in, pleasurable stimuli, and it is considered to be a core symptom of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0269881112474523">Nelson and Charney, 1981</xref>) and has been suggested as a possible endophenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112474523">Hasler et al., 2004</xref>). As discussed above, depressed patients exhibit an emotional processing bias away from positive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0269881112474523">Mathews and MacLeod, 2005</xref>), and emotional responding to pleasurable stimuli also seems to be diminished in major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112474523">Berenbaum and Oltmanns, 1992</xref>). Behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms which probe reward processing represent a useful way of assessing reactivity to reinforcing stimuli which may be relevant to anhedonia in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0269881112474523">McCabe et al., 2009</xref>). Reward processing involves a number of component processes including pleasure, reward validation, cost benefit analysis, decision making, prediction, anticipation and motivation, and a network of brain regions are thought to subserve these processes including ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, PFC, ventral tegmental area and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112474523">Der-Avakian and Markou, 2012</xref>). Studies of reward processing in depressed patients suggest perturbations in these brain regions compared with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112474523">Elliott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881112474523">Keedwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269881112474523">Knutson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0269881112474523">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0269881112474523">Steele et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A recently developed neuroimaging paradigm allows the measurement of neural activity to primary rewarding and aversive stimuli and may provide a sensitive biomarker of anhedonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0269881112474523">McCabe et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0269881112474523">2010</xref>). The model examines the neural response to both rewarding and aversive food stimuli. The rewarding condition involves the sight/flavour of chocolate and the aversive the sight/flavour of mouldy and unpleasant strawberries. Using this paradigm McCabe et al. examined the effects of 7 days of treatment with citalopram and reboxetine on primary and secondary reward and aversion in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0269881112474523">McCabe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112474523">Figure 1</xref>). The authors show that while citalopram reduced ventral striatum and ventral medial/orbitofrontal responding to the reward stimulus, reboxetine did not. Furthermore, reboxetine actually enhanced the BOLD response in a key reward region, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, to the reward stimulus. For the aversive condition, both drugs decreased the BOLD response to the aversive stimulus in key areas involved in the processing of unpleasant stimuli such as the lateral orbitofrontal and insular cortices, (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269881112474523">Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004</xref>); however, this effect was weaker in the group receiving reboxetine. This study further highlights the differential effects of serotonergic versus catecholaminergic drug effects on the processing of positive and negative information.</p>

<p>Patient experiences suggest that SSRIs may result in a general dampening of all emotional experience (negative and positive), a phenomenon referred to as emotional blunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0269881112474523">Price et al., 2009</xref>). The finding that citalopram can reduce responses in brain regions associated with reward processing provides a plausible neural mechanism for this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0269881112474523">McCabe et al., 2010</xref>). Potentiating NA with reboxetine does not appear to confer this effect; rather, reboxetine increased neuronal activity in parts of this reward circuitry. This provides further evidence to support the notion of 5-HT mediating the reduction in negative (and possibly some aspects of positive) affective processing, while NA potentiation may actually have a stronger effect in upregulating the processing of positive stimuli. A recent study examining the effects of 2 weeks of SNRI (duloxetine) treatment on a monetary incentive delay task in healthy volunteers corroborates this interpretation, finding that the drug enhanced ventral striatal BOLD responses to reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0269881112474523">Ossewaarde et al., 2011</xref>). One important difference between these two studies is that while both studies demonstrate that potentiating NA can increase neural responses in areas of the brain known to be important in reward processing, they differ in the areas that were affected (medial orbitofrontal cortex vs. ventral striatum). This difference may be explained by the contrast between passive responses to primary rewards in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0269881112474523">McCabe et al., 2010</xref>), and the need for participants to respond for a monetary reward in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0269881112474523">Ossewaarde et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, instrumental responding for rewards has previously been associated with stronger BOLD responses in ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112474523">Bjork and Hommer, 2007</xref>), and therefore replication in the same paradigm would be interesting.</p>
<p>Studies have also begun to examine other primary rewards, sexual reward cues, and have contrasted the effects of the SSRI paroxetine with the NA-DA reuptake inhibitor bupropion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112474523">Abler et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112474523">2012</xref>). Together, these two studies suggest that while paroxetine reduced responding in reward circuitry, an effect which appeared to be mediated by increased PFC responses, bupropion did not. Not only do these studies further support the idea that potentiating NA can enhance primary reward processing, but by using psychophysiological interaction these data suggest a possible mechanism by which potentiation of serotonin could in fact downregulate reward processing. They also have obvious implications for the sexual side effects often associated with SSRI treatment, which may in itself be a further facet of reduced positive emotional responding.</p>
<p>Together these studies provide further evidence to support the emerging hypothesis that drugs which potentiate noradrenaline have greater effects in upregulating positive aspects of emotional processing than do those which potentiate serotonin. In fact, the studies investigating reward suggest that potentiating serotonin may even have an inhibitory effect on reward processing, providing a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of emotional blunting in some groups of patients.</p>

<title>Conclusions and caveats</title>
<p>We and others have argued that all effective antidepressant drugs act on a final common psychological pathway, by remediating negative biases in emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112474523">Elliott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112474523">Harmer et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0269881112474523">Pringle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0269881112474523">Roiser et al., 2012</xref>). However, there may be some subtle differences in the aspects of emotional processing that specific drug treatments target in keeping with their clinical profiles. In particular, the data discussed here are consistent with the hypothesis that potentiating the noradrenergic system effects symptoms related to a lack of positive affect more so than the serotonergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0269881112474523">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0269881112474523">Shelton and Tomarken, 2001</xref>). Recent clinical trials have questioned the efficacy of NRIs in treating depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112474523">Eyding et al., 2010</xref>), leading to the suggestion that NA potentiation alone is insufficient for successful treatment [although note that head-to-head comparisons of reboxetine and SSRI treatments have largely shown similar response rates especially when tolerability is considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0269881112474523">Papakostas et al., 2008</xref>)], and in terms of the neuropsychological data, these drugs have less impact on processing of negative affective cues. However, drugs which potentiate both the serotonergic and NA neurotransmitter systems could theoretically be more advantageous than those which potentiate serotonin alone in addressing both general distress symptoms (via 5-HT) and anhedonia/loss of positive affect (via NA). In terms of personalising treatment, these drugs should be more effective for patients whose symptoms are particularly characterised by those symptoms falling in the loss of positive affect dimension of depressive symptomatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0269881112474523">Nutt et al., 2007</xref>). The findings from the reward-processing studies are particularly interesting, and it may be that those patients who show impaired processing of reward coupled with heightened processing of negative affective stimuli would particularly benefit from dual-reuptake inhibition. They may also be useful in remediating the residual symptoms, such as fatigue and apathy, which have been demonstrated to be a significant predictor of relapse in patients in remission (for a review discussing residual symptoms see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112474523">Fava, 2006</xref>). We have also suggested that drugs which act on NA may also have earlier effects than those acting on 5-HT alone in terms of emotional memory. Broadly speaking, the limited research findings using the SNRI duloxetine and other catecholamine-potentiating agents corroborate these speculations, but further research using SNRIs and directly contrasting the effects of SSRI and NRI drugs on emotional processing will be required.</p>
<p>In terms of caveats, it should be noted that although we have reviewed the evidence for the most specific of the SSRIs and NRIs (citalopram and reboxetine, respectively), it is still the case that these drugs (depending on dose) have effects on systems that largely overlap, and also on other neurotransmitters. Early evidence suggested that 5-HT and NA neurons diffusely innervate all regions of the neocortex via extensive collateralisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112474523">Fuxe et al., 1968</xref>); however, more detailed examination suggests that monoamine projections in fact demonstrate a regional, laminate and intractortical specificity, findings that are interpreted as evidence for physiological specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0269881112474523">Parnavelas and Papadopoulos, 1989</xref>). The precise pharmacological mechanism(s) by which these different drugs effect behaviour is still unclear, but the neuroimaging data suggesting that different classes of drugs modulate brain activity in different brain regions merit further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112474523">Brühl et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112474523">2011</xref>). In a related point, there is currently no direct evidence to demonstrate that a given antidepressant increases a particular neurotransmitter and that it is this increase in neurotransmission which instigates changes in emotional processing; however, studies in which central 5-HT has been depleted via acute tryptophan depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112474523">Crockett et al., 2012</xref>) and which show negative changes in emotional processing (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881112474523">Harmer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0269881112474523">Roiser et al., 2008</xref>) at least provide some support for this notion. In addition, as noted in the introduction, this review has primarily compared and contrasted citalopram and reboxetine as the most specific examples of their respective classes. Other drugs from within each of these classes, however, possess different off-site targets; for example, the SSRI fluoxetine is also a 5-HT2C antagonist and could therefore potentially increase noradrenaline and dopamine neurotransmission, while another SSRI, paroxetine is also an M1 antagonist. This raises the interesting possibility that, as well as interclass differences in emotional processing, there may also be subtle intraclass differences in the profiles of these drugs. Within this framework, it seems likely that while drugs within given classes share a general pattern of effects on emotional processing, there may be fine-grained differences within this which may have important implications for treatment, and which may also be important for tailoring treatments in depression. We have also argued here that differences in neural responses to reward processing following antidepressant treatment may provide a plausible mechanism to explain emotional blunting; however, it should be noted that although anecdotally SSRIs have been more associated with emotional blunting, there is no evidence to suggest that the emotional blunting effects are greater than with any other particular class of antidepressant.</p>
<p>The findings reviewed here suggest that healthy volunteer models of emotional processing and the processing of rewarding stimuli may present a useful means by which to explore the differential effects of antidepressant drugs with differing pharmacological profiles. Future studies will be required to directly test the hypotheses suggested here in relation to SSRIs, NRIs and dual-acting agents. Moreover, human experimental models such as those described here, examining the processing of emotional and rewarding information, could also prove to be a practical framework for achieving personalised treatment, whereby symptom profiles might be better matched to the appropriate treatment.</p>

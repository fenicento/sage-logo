<abstract>
<p>Selective mutism (SM) is a relatively rare disorder and is most commonly found among young children. Children and adolescents presenting with SM and its associated features (e.g., social anxiety, social skills deficits) are often challenging to treat, and recent data suggest that SM is characterized by heightened levels of autonomic arousal, often coupled with behavioral avoidance. In this report, we present the case of Nina, a 17-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with comorbid SM and social anxiety disorder. Standard intervention designed to treat social anxiety disorder (i.e., intensive exposure based on an extinction paradigm) met with a minimal response and no changes in speech behavior. Reconceptualization of the treatment approach led to a decision to focus directly on speech using a graduated exposure (desensitization) paradigm. To create an emotional response incompatible with anxiety, initial desensitization sessions used Apple iPad applications that allowed for engagement in amusing tasks and the pairing of vocalization with positive emotions. Traditional social skills training constituted the final treatment component. Advantages and limitations associated with the various treatment modalities used are discussed as well as recommendations for future clinical research.</p>

<title>1 Theoretical and Research Basis for Treatment</title>
<p>Selective mutism (SM) is typically diagnosed in childhood and is associated with a number of concomitant features. The <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113483357">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>) classifies SM as a persistent failure to speak during certain social situations during which speaking is expected (e.g., at school, among peers), despite speaking in other situations (e.g., at home among family members), to the extent that refusal/failure to speak interferes with achievement (e.g., educational, occupational) or appropriate social communication. The typical age of onset for SM ranges from 2.7 to 4.1 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650113483357">Cunningham, McHolm, Boyle, &amp; Patel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534650113483357">Garcia, Freeman, Francis, Miller, &amp; Leonard, 2004</xref>) and its prevalence is less than 1% of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534650113483357">Bergman, Piacentini, &amp; McCracken, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534650113483357">Chavira, Stein, Bailey, &amp; Stein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650113483357">Elizur &amp; Perednik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650113483357">Steinhausen &amp; Juzi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534650113483357">Viana, Beidel, &amp; Rabian, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between SM and social anxiety has been of particular interest to researchers and clinicians, and various theories have been postulated regarding their shared clinical presentation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534650113483357">Viana et al., 2009</xref>, for a review). Specifically, SM may represent a developmental variant of social anxiety disorder (a disorder characterized by intense fear and avoidance of social interactions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113483357">APA, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534650113483357">Bergman et al., 2002</xref>), as the two disorders are strikingly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534650113483357">Anstendig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650113483357">Black &amp; Uhde, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534650113483357">Silveira, Jainer, &amp; Bates, 2004</xref>). Children presenting with SM report being too afraid to speak in social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650113483357">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650113483357">Dummit, Klein, Tancer, &amp; Asche, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534650113483357">Sharp, Sherman, &amp; Gross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534650113483357">Vecchio &amp; Kearney 2005</xref>) and may use withdrawal of speech as an avoidance mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534650113483357">Young, Bunnell, &amp; Beidel, 2012</xref>). Data supporting the diagnostic overlap include the findings that children with SM (a) frequently meet diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder, with the comorbidity ranging from 80% to 97% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650113483357">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534650113483357">Young et al., 2012</xref>); (b) endorse elevated levels of social anxiety and shyness on self-report measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534650113483357">Carbone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650113483357">Cunningham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650113483357">Dummit et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650113483357">Steinhausen &amp; Juzi, 1996</xref>); (c) demonstrate high familial loadings for anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650113483357">Black &amp; Uhde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113483357">Chavira, Shipon-Blum, &amp; Stein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534650113483357">Kolvin &amp; Fundudis, 1981</xref>); and (d) benefit from treatments designed to reduce social anxiety, pharmacological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650113483357">Black &amp; Uhde, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650113483357">Lafferty, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534650113483357">Lehman, 2002</xref>) and cognitive/behavioral (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534650113483357">Anstendig, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113483357">Cohan, Chavira, &amp; Stein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534650113483357">Pionek Stone, Kratochwill, Sladezcek, &amp; Serlin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534650113483357">Viana et al., 2009</xref>, for reviews).</p>
<p>There has been some noted efficacy for behavioral intervention for children with SM (e.g., contingency management, shaping, and systematic desensitization; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113483357">Cohan et al., 2006</xref>, for a review), but reports of their efficacy in late adolescents are few. Furthermore, the interventions are often lengthy, with multiple sessions required prior to achieving success. In addition, adult attention/pleas to speak often develop a paradoxical behavioral response from the child (i.e., as the adults plead with the child to speak, that attention may reinforce lack of speech). Using tasks that require vocalization but engage children in reinforcing game-like activities may shift direct focus away from speaking, which in turn could decrease social anxiety and allow speech to occur. Technology such as Apple iPad applications, which provides engaging activities, offers potentially important tools for the treatment of this disorder.</p>

<title>2 Case Introduction</title>
<p>In this report, we describe the treatment of a 17-year-old female (Nina) with comorbid diagnoses of SM and social anxiety disorder. Since age 4, Nina refused to speak to extended- and nonfamily members. According to Nina and her mother, her refusal was based on overwhelming anxiety. The goal of treatment was to decrease social anxiety and for Nina to speak during social situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534650113483357">
<title>3 Presenting Complaints</title>
<p>Nina had not spoken to anyone other than first-degree relatives since she was approximately 4 years old. The only exception was very infrequent whispers to a first-grade peer and a speech teacher (from kindergarten to third grade). At the time of intake, Nina communicated via written notes, text messages, and instant messages. Nina’s mother also reported that Nina had a long-standing history of being bullied and rejected by her peers (e.g., peers referred to her as “stupid” and often stole her belongings) secondary to her mutism. In addition to being bullied, Nina had few close friends and spent little time engaged in social interaction within and outside of school. She also demonstrated impairment in classes when speech was required (e.g., Spanish class). It is important to note that despite her lack of speech, Nina demonstrated strong academic achievement including advanced placement and dual-enrollment courses. In addition, she was an honors student and participated in the National Honor Society. She also served as an assistant athletic trainer for her high school sports program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534650113483357">
<title>4 History</title>
<p>Nina’s pre-, peri-, and post-natal history and her developmental history were unremarkable. Nina made appropriate eye contact, was easily comforted, exhibited appropriate use of and reaction to gestures, and bonded well socially as an infant and toddler. She achieved all developmental milestones within normal limits with the exception of toilet training. Specifically, she was toilet trained at 4 years of age but had monthly to bimonthly episodes of diurnal enuresis until age 7.</p>
<p>Nina spoke her first words by 9 months and used three-word sentences by 15 months. From an early age, she spoke infrequently and appeared quiet and withdrawn in the presence of others. She typically used gestures to communicate. On entering kindergarten at 4 years of age, Nina refused to speak to school staff or peers. She was enrolled in a half-day speech class from kindergarten to third grade and would whisper with limited frequency only to her speech teacher. During first grade, Nina whispered to one peer to facilitate communication with others, but this ceased 1 year later.</p>
<p>Nina’s medical history was unremarkable with the exception of three occurrences of otitis media at approximately 3, 4, and 6 years of age, with no impact on her hearing. At 4 years of age, she underwent intelligence and speech testing. Although scoring in the above average range intellectually, Nina was diagnosed with an articulation disorder (i.e., she was unable to pronounce the sounds th, ch, s, and r), which was still present at the time of intake. She was diagnosed with SM at 9 years of age and participated in play therapy for 22 sessions over 7 months and again for 6 sessions over 3 months at 11 years of age. This treatment was ineffective and Nina had an 18-month trial of fluoxetine (10 mg per day) at 16 years of age, with no result. After a 3-month discontinuation period, fluoxetine was reinitiated at 20 mg per day. Although the medication was not effective, she remained on that dose throughout the course of treatment.</p>
<p>One of the unique aspects of this case of SM was Nina’s age at the time of intake. SM is most often diagnosed in preschool or early elementary school–age children. Although there are no controlled longitudinal investigations, it is exceedingly rare to see a 17-year-old with such chronic SM. Thus, the extensive negative reinforcement history presented a unique challenge when designing a treatment program. Furthermore, younger children who do not speak around peers are typically accepted by their classmates, who often inadvertently reinforce their lack of speech by speaking for them. In contrast, Nina had a long-standing history of being bullied by her peers because of her mutism. Thus, there was little incentive for her to begin speaking at school as it was unlikely that engaging in social interaction would suddenly result in peer support or interaction.</p>

<title>5 Assessment</title>
<p>The assessment included a diagnostic interview, child- and parent-report measures, and a behavioral observation of social interactions with same-aged peers. Nina remained silent throughout the assessment with the exception of whispers to her mother when the clinician left the room.</p>
<sec id="section6-1534650113483357">
<title>Diagnostic Interview</title>
<p>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for <italic>DSM-IV</italic>–Child/Parent Version (ADIS-IV-C/P; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534650113483357">Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996</xref>) was administered to Nina and her mother. Nina communicated by nodding her head or writing her responses. The interviews confirmed a history of anxiety during social situations (e.g., answering questions in class, giving oral reports, asking the teachers questions, working in groups, and any other situations requiring her to speak to others) since Nina was a toddler. She endorsed worrying that others would make fun of and laugh at her regarding her weight and lack of speech, both of which had made her a target for bullying. Nina and her mother also reported lack of speech around extended family and other individuals both within and outside of their home. Nina reported that she felt that she was “unable to speak” due to overwhelming anxiety.</p>

<title>Self-Report Measures</title>
<p>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534650113483357">Table 1</xref> for scores on assessment measures. Nina completed the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650113483357">Beidel, Turner, &amp; Morris, 1995</xref>), which consists of 26 items assessing social distress. Items are rated using a 3-point Likert-type scale. Although Nina was 17 years old at intake, the SPAI-C was selected rather than the adult SPAI as the items were more applicable to Nina’s current environment and maturity level. Nina’s score of 46 exceeded the cutoff of 18 (suggestive of probable social anxiety disorder) recommended by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650113483357">Beidel et al., 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Behavioral Assessment</title>
<p>Following a 10-min resting baseline, Nina engaged in two social interactions and rated her anxiety level on a 0 to 8 Likert-type scale before and after each task. The first task was a 5-min unstructured interaction with a same-age peer while playing the Nintendo Wii. During the second interaction, Nina was instructed to give a 10-min speech in front of a five-member audience using any of the following topics: favorite hobbies, favorite music, recent movie seen, favorite school subject, favorite books, dream job, favorite sports team. She was given 3 min to prepare and was asked to speak for at least 3 min, after which she could end the speech if she felt too anxious to continue. Nina did not speak during either task. As soon as the 3 min time requirement was completed, Nina held up the STOP card to end the speech interaction. She rated her anxiety as 3 (mild) before and during the social interaction task, but reported ratings of 2 (mild) and 8 (extreme) for the speech task (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534650113483357">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>6 Case Conceptualization</title>
<p>Based on self- and parental-report as well as behavioral observations, Nina met diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder and SM. With respect to etiology, it appeared that Nina’s SM occurred secondary to her social anxiety and may have (a) functioned as an emotion regulation strategy (i.e., the avoidance of speaking served to decrease or limit anxiety during social situations) or (b) occurred as a result of a <italic>fright</italic> response to social situations (i.e., Nina believed that she was unable to speak in social situations due to heightened levels of anxiety; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534650113483357">Schauer &amp; Elbert, 2010</xref>). In addition, maintenance factors included a robust history of positive and negative reinforcement for her mutism. For example, Nina received marked attention (e.g., was well-known as “the girl who does not talk”) as well as academic accommodations (e.g., did not have to participate in oral assignments, did not have to answer questions during class, was allowed to communicate with instructors via written notes). Moreover, she reported experiencing decreased anxiety when she successfully avoided speaking in certain social situations when speech was expected. Treatment targeted decreasing social anxiety as well as increasing speaking behaviors and social skill.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1534650113483357">
<title>7 Course of Treatment and Assessment of Progress</title>
<p>Everyday throughout the course of treatment, Nina recorded the frequency of specific target behaviors (i.e., speech at school, speech outside of the home, and refusal to speak) as well as her distress during social interactions. These social interactions naturally fell into three categories (i.e., school-related interactions, interactions with grandparents, and anxiety in public places). Nina’s anxiety ratings as well as the frequency of her daily speech behaviors are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534650113483357">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534650113483357">2</xref>. Pre-treatment levels of anxiety across all social situations were moderate (<italic>M</italic> = 3.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.62). The frequency of daily speech was nonexistent at school and was minimal outside of school (<italic>M</italic> = 0.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.45). The three phases of Nina’s treatment as well as her progress throughout treatment are outlined below.</p>

<title>Treatment Phase I: Intensive Exposure</title>
<p>Given Nina’s age, the initial treatment plan consisted of intensive exposure (i.e., flooding), an empirically supported treatment for social anxiety disorder. Although graduated exposure is more typical for children with SM, intensive exposure is often more expedient with adults, who are more likely to understand the rationale for this approach and be willing to tolerate the higher levels of distress. Given Nina’s age, it seemed appropriate to initiate treatment in this fashion, particularly because she lived an hour’s distance from the clinic and the family had financial hardships, including difficulty paying for gasoline to come to appointments. Nina participated in one psychoeducation session and five sessions of exposure therapy. During the psychoeducation session, a contingency management plan was developed to reward Nina for her hard work and “courage” during each exposure session. Because Nina initially reported that her lack of speech was due to intense anxiety simply in the presence of others, treatment began with exposure to large groups of students in various locations on a college campus (e.g., the student union). Nina was also assigned weekly homework assignments to spend time in densely populated locations (e.g., a local mall) until her anxiety rating reached her baseline level.</p>
<p>The top half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534650113483357">Figure 3</xref> displays Nina’s anxiety ratings during each intensive exposure session. Between-session habituation was minimal across sessions and no changes in anxiety during daily interactions were observed outside of the therapy sessions. Although Nina reported lower anxiety at the end of the exposure session, she still did not speak during this phase of treatment either within the session or in her daily environment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534650113483357">Figure 1</xref> and the top half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534650113483357">Figure 3</xref>). Based on this lack of progress, the decision was made to change from an intensive to a graduated exposure paradigm.</p>

<sec id="section13-1534650113483357">
<title>Treatment Phase II: Graduated Exposure</title>
<p>A hierarchy was developed for Nina, with the lowest step including vocalization in the presence of the clinician. The highest step was speaking to teachers and peers at school (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534650113483357">Table 3</xref>). Phase II began with psychoeducation and behavioral contracting. Potential rewards for Nina’s compliant responses were discussed. Nina wanted to volunteer at a local animal shelter. Therefore, a reward system was developed which allowed Nina to receive 1 point, equivalent to 1 min of volunteer time, for each compliant response emitted during the initial treatment session. Sessions were held once per week and all sessions were video and/or audio recorded and speech duration was coded using the Noldus Observer XT (Version 10.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650113483357">Noldus Information Technology, 2010</xref>). Duration was calculated as the percentage of time spoken during each session.</p>

<title>Phase II: Session 1</title>
<p>The initial target was to emit any type of audible sound in the presence of the clinician. To make the task engaging, Apple iPad applications were used to decrease the focus on speech production. It was hypothesized that the iPad applications would make the sessions more game-like, and focus attention on “winning the game” rather than a singular focus on speech. To initially produce an audible sound, the Apple iPad Free Candle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534650113483357">Poets Mobile, 2011</xref>) application was used. Briefly, the Free Candle application displays a variety of lit candles that may be “blown out” by blowing/producing sound into the iPad microphone. Using a continuous reinforcement schedule, Nina was rewarded for raising the iPad toward and opening her mouth, and then after she successfully blew out each candle. Over time, the reinforcement schedule was changed to require blowing out the candle with increased pressure and frequency (e.g., blowing 3 times).</p>
<p>Next, Nina was instructed to answer yes or no questions from the clinician using one blow for yes and two blows for no. Following this, she was rewarded for shaping her mouth to produce vowel sounds as she blew out the candle, beginning with the letter “O” and then on to the letter “U.” Nina was then rewarded for sounding out each of the vowels and then each letter of the alphabet, in order (while still attempting to blow out the candle). She was then reinforced for spelling people’s names and then the names of various objects found in the treatment room. Following this, Nina was rewarded for sounding out the people’s names and the names of objects, and then answering open-ended, one-word response questions from the clinician. The session lasted for 75 min and concluded with a 30-min conversation between Nina and the clinician, remarkable because she had not spoken to a nonfamily member for approximately 10 years. Nina reported that she was proud of her performance. Although speaking in an audible whisper, Nina spoke for approximately 6.0% of the session and earned 261 min of volunteer time. Nina’s self-reported anxiety during this initial desensitization session was similar to what was reported during intensive exposure therapy. She reported a baseline rating of 8, which decreased to a rating of 3 within 50 min. However, unlike the intensive exposure approach, this graduated approach and focus on speech production produced audible speech at the end of one session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534650113483357">
<title>Phase II: Session 2</title>
<p>The goal of the second session was for Nina to speak at a voice volume typical for normal conversation. The Apple iPad SPL Decibel Meter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534650113483357">Smith, 2012</xref>), which displays the sound decibel level received by the iPad, was used to shape Nina to speak at an increasingly louder volume during the session. After 3 min of use, Nina spoke at an appropriate volume and the application was no longer needed. The clinician and Nina participated in a 1-hr conversation while discussing Nina’s school courses, career plans, and interests. Nina was reinforced with praise during this session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534650113483357">
<title>Phase II: Session 3</title>
<p>The goal for the third session was for Nina to speak at a normal voice volume while others were in the room. The SPL Decibel Meter application was used again during this session. The session began with a conversation with the clinician, during which a male research assistant sat on the opposite side of the room while wearing sound-canceling headphones. The research assistant gradually moved closer to Nina as the conversation progressed. He subsequently removed the headphones and began speaking with Nina. Following a brief conversation with the confederate, additional research assistants, male and female, entered the room and joined the conversation. A total of nine research assistants participated in the conversation simultaneously with Nina by the end of the third session. Nina’s mother joined the conversation for the last 10 min of the session. Nina was reinforced with praise during this session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534650113483357">
<title>Phase II: Session 4</title>
<p>The goal for the fourth session was for Nina to speak at a normal voice volume with a group of people outside of the clinic. The session began with a brief conversation between Nina and a group of 12 research assistants at the clinic, followed by a conversation in the atrium of the building. Nina and the research assistants then walked across campus to the student union, conversing in densely populated areas of the student union. Nina ordered verbally an ice cream cone from a shop at the end of the conversation. She was reinforced with praise during the session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1534650113483357">
<title>Phase II: Session 5</title>
<p>The goal for the fifth session was for Nina to speak at a normal voice volume with a same-age male peer. The session began with a brief conversation at the clinic followed by a longer conversation at a local frozen yogurt shop. Nina participated actively during the conversation while providing spontaneous statements and questions as well as appropriate responses to the peer’s questions. She was reinforced with praise during the session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1534650113483357">
<title>Phase II: Session 6</title>
<p>The sixth session took place at Nina’s high school. The goal was for Nina to speak at a normal voice volume while at school with a familiar male peer and male teacher. She was initially hesitant to speak but then participated actively throughout the session. Important to note is that Nina’s teacher spoke frequently and for long durations making it difficult for Nina to engage equally in the conversation. After achieving the highest level of the hierarchy, it was clear that Nina was still deficient in numerous social skills. Therefore, treatment continued with formal social skills training.</p>
<p>The percentage of time spoken during each session is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534650113483357">Figure 4</xref>. The bottom half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534650113483357">Figure 3</xref> displays Nina’s anxiety ratings during each desensitization session. As demonstrated by these graphs, in-session speech duration increased and anxiety during social interactions decreased inside and outside of the clinic. Furthermore, she reported an increase in the frequency of her speech at school and outside of her home (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534650113483357">Figure 1</xref>) as well as general decreases in her anxious arousal during daily social interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534650113483357">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment Phase III: Social Effectiveness Therapy (SET)</title>
<p>SET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534650113483357">Turner, Beidel, Cooley, &amp; Woody, 1994</xref>) is a multicomponent behavioral treatment program that aims to (a) reduce social anxiety, (b) increase participation in a greater number of social interactions, and (c) improve overall interpersonal effectiveness. The 12 social skills training sessions occur once weekly, typically in a group format. Skills addressed in SET include initiating and maintaining conversations, inviting others to join in activities, conversing on the phone, being assertive with peers and authority figures, and public speaking skills. Each session includes <italic>instruction</italic> on the current session’s social skill, <italic>modeling</italic> of the skill by the clinician, <italic>behavioral rehearsal</italic> of the skill by group members, and positive and constructive <italic>feedback</italic> provided by group members and the clinician. Following each session, group members complete weekly homework assignments that serve to increase social interaction, allow for “extra practice” of the social skill, and generalize the use of the social skill to various community settings.</p>
<p>SET was selected, rather than its child version (i.e., SET for Children; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650113483357">Beidel, Turner, &amp; Morris, 2000</xref>), to better prepare Nina for adult interactions, given that she was to begin attending college in a few months. Nina participated in SET with a same-age male peer who was also diagnosed with social anxiety disorder but who did not exhibit a history of SM. The treatment protocol was condensed to include 11 sessions due to time constraints (i.e., Sessions 10 and 11 were combined), and research assistants assisted with behavioral rehearsal/role plays to provide additional practice opportunities. In addition to noticeable qualitative improvement, self-monitoring data indicated a continued general decrease in anxiety during daily social interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534650113483357">Figure 2</xref>) and a continued general increase in the frequency of her speech outside of treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534650113483357">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1534650113483357">
<title>8 Complicating Factors</title>
<p>A complicating factor in this case was the chronicity of the SM. First, Nina began treatment at 17 years of age and thus had an extensive reinforcement history that strongly influenced her mutism. Specifically, and consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650113483357">Mowrer’s (1947)</xref> two factor theory, Nina’s mutism was reinforced by marked attention as well as special accommodations (i.e., opportunities for avoidance) which likely functioned to decrease anxiety in certain social situations. Moreover, having attended the same school for 4 years, Nina had a reputation among her peers as “the girl who does not talk.” Therefore, Nina received increased attention when she began to speak to some individuals at school, something that she feared intently. These factors hindered social skills practice with her peers as she was reluctant to engage them in conversation.</p>
<p>A complicating factor frequently observed in patients with SM, including Nina, is the presence of social skill deficits. Nina’s difficulties with social interaction were not evident until she began speaking and were especially salient given her age. In particular, Nina lacked knowledge about basic social skills such as how to initiate conversations. Furthermore, she experienced difficulties with basic social conventions such as establishing eye contact. This presented a major challenge for the clinician while attempting to encourage social interaction. Simply decreasing anxiety did not result in the emergence of skilled behavior. Nina had to be trained specifically in effective social discourse.</p>
<p>A final complicating factor was a lack of opportunities for socialization. Specifically, Nina had few peer relationships and therefore had limited options for social engagement. She was fortunate to have one peer with whom she could practice her social skills, but because of her reluctance to speak at school (drawing attention to herself), she was unable to practice with a variety of peers, other than research assistants at our clinic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1534650113483357">
<title>9 Access and Barriers to Care</title>
<p>Other than the complicating factors, few barriers to care were observed in this case. One barrier for Nina related to her family’s minimal financial resources. Although treatment was provided at no cost, Nina’s mother was frequently concerned about the cost of gasoline necessary for travel to the clinic. Fortunately, Nina’s extended family was supportive and contributed funds when necessary.</p>
<p>Despite the few barriers observed in this case, there are a number of barriers that may present for those seeking treatment for SM. First, limited financial resources often pose a barrier for those seeking treatment initially as well as those desiring to continue paid services from a clinician on a weekly or even biweekly basis. The authors recognize that few clinics, especially those in the community, are able to provide assessment and treatment services at no cost, so access to treatment for many families will certainly be limited. Second, many mental health clinics in the community may be limited in the resources that they have available for such a comprehensive treatment. For example, not all clinicians have access to an iPad and even fewer are likely to have access to a variety of persons with which the child may practice social skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1534650113483357">
<title>10 Follow-Up</title>
<p>Nina was evaluated 1 week following the completion of SET. During this evaluation, Nina’s mother completed the SPAI-C-PV and Nina completed the SPAI-C, CDI, and a behavioral assessment (i.e., a social interaction task and impromptu speech task). The results of the assessment are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534650113483357">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534650113483357">2</xref>. There was a 15-point decrease in Nina’s score on the SPAI-C from pre-treatment to post-treatment, although this score remained above the cutoff (18) noted earlier. Decreases in Nina’s social anxiety were also reported by Nina’s mother (SPAI-C-PV decrease from 46 to 7 from pre- to post-treatment). Nina’s initially elevated score on the Ineffectiveness subscale of the CDI decreased (i.e., a decrease in level from 66 to 38 from pre- to post-treatment). Although her self-reported anxiety was still elevated, functional improvement was evident in her report of daily experiences (e.g., increased speaking and participation in social interactions, decreased anxiety during daily social interactions) and her performance during the behavioral assessment. Specifically, Nina’s anxiety ratings decreased notably from pre- to post-treatment and she spoke more frequently (0% [pre] vs. 15% [post] duration during the social interaction task and 0% [pre] vs. 68% [post] duration during the impromptu speech task). She also responded to more questions from the peer during the social interaction task (0% [pre] vs. 95% [post] response rate), and spoke for the entire 10 min during the impromptu speech task (Nina actually spoke longer than the 10-min time limit to complete her thoughts).</p>
<p>Qualitative improvements were reported by Nina. She discussed being proud of herself and that it was “unbelievable how far [she] came in such a short period of time.” At the time of follow-up, Nina was preparing to move out of her parent’s home to attend college at a university 100 miles away from her home. She reported that she openly communicated with others, and appeared optimistic about her future studies and career goals. A longer follow-up would have been ideal but was not possible as Nina lacked the financial resources to travel to the clinic from her new university residence. The authors note that this is a limitation of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1534650113483357">
<title>11 Treatment Implications of the Case</title>
<p>The present case has implications for those seeking to treat youth with SM. Particularly, exposure to social situations did not result in significant anxiety decrements and did not produce the spontaneous emergence of public speaking behaviors. As illustrated by differences in anxiety ratings during the intensive (i.e., using extinction) versus gradual exposure (i.e., using desensitization) sessions, it may be the case that pairing the behavior with an incompatible emotional response is more efficacious. Furthermore, the “fright” response experienced by some with SM might be avoided as anxiety is not reaching intensive levels.</p>
<p>A sequence of steps that might be used during desensitization is also demonstrated, along with tools that might prove valuable in facilitating treatment engagement (i.e., Apple iPad applications), at least during initial stages. More engagement during treatment secondary to the use of instruments such as the iPad may also translate to faster behavioral change, as illustrated by the 30-min conversation held with Nina after only the first session using the iPad. Future dismantling studies may clarify the extent to which this occurs during treatment with and without the use of tools such as the iPad.</p>
<p>Another important implication of this case is that simply achieving the goal of speaking aloud may not be a sufficient treatment outcome for those with SM. Treatments such as formal social skills training may be needed to increase social effectiveness, especially in older patients presenting with SM. A history of a lack of social interactions may translate to skill deficits and therefore will need to be targeted during treatment. This may promote resiliency and the maintenance of treatment gains following discharge of the patient.</p>

<sec id="section25-1534650113483357">
<title>12 Recommendations to Clinicians and Students</title>
<p>Despite noted efficacy of behavioral intervention for SM (e.g., contingency management, shaping, and systematic desensitization), many therapists are not familiar with these procedures or fail to use them when treating children, turning instead to less empirically supported treatments such as nonbehaviorally focused play therapy. Moreover, therapists often experience difficulty engaging children in treatment and/or eliciting compliant responses from them. Technology such as Apple iPad applications provides potentially important tools for the treatment of SM, as the engaging and reinforcing applications may take the focus away from the emphasis on speech and produce an incompatible emotion, allowing audible sounds and eventually speech to occur. Thus, the use of such technology in conjunction with behavioral treatments offers an appealing and flexible means by which to implement behavioral interventions in this population, and should be considered for use in future interventions.</p>

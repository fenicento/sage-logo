<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the influence of fibroblast growth factor receptor type B (FGFRb) and fibroblast growth factor on cervical carcinogenesis associated with HPV16 E6/7 infection, using primary cancer cells isolated from Taiwanese patients with cervical cancer. Functional interaction between FGFRb in Cx cells and HPV16 E6/7 transfected Cx cells (CxWJ cells) following treatment with FGF-7, according to cell growth, invasive ability, and tumor growth in SCID mice. Our results indicate that the downregulation of <italic>FGFRb</italic> gene expression in CxWJ cells partially represses proliferation and the invasive ability provided by FGF-7 stimulation. In SCID mice, the <italic>FGF2</italic> and <italic>FGFR1</italic> gene expression ascend in CxWJ tumor nodule. These data provide evidence of a functional interaction between HPV16 E6/7 in FGFRb and FGF2, suggesting that cooperative stimulation of HPV E6/7 in inactivated FGFRb and the upregulation of FGF2 may be necessary to completely overcome the oncogenic function associated with the progression of cervical carcinogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cervical cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in women and a leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111432874">1</xref>
</sup> In Taiwan, cervical cancer is the sixth most common form of cancerous malignancy among females.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111432874">2</xref>
</sup> The majority of women diagnosed with cervical cancer exhibit advanced, widely disseminated malignancy and poor prognosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111432874">3</xref>
</sup> An overwhelming body of evidence has demonstrated that oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) play an important role in the development of cervical cancer precursors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111432874">4</xref>
</sup> However, only a small fraction of females infected with HPV develop cervical cancer, indicating that other factors contribute to the progression of lesions in invasive cervical cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111432874">5</xref>
</sup> The role of HPV as a cause of cervical cancer has been demonstrated, by its association with other malignancies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111432874">6</xref>
</sup> The serotype most frequently found in HPV-positive cervical tumors is HPV16.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111432874">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of structurally related polypeptides, comprising at least 23 members, commonly identified as classical FGFs. The traditional designations, acidic FGF and basic FGF, are now known as FGF1 and FGF2, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111432874">8</xref>
</sup> Fibroblast growth factors share between 35% and 50% amino acid sequence homology, acting as mediators in a diverse range of developmental and physiological processes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111432874">9</xref>
</sup> Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors are implicated in the development of several human cancers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111432874">10</xref>
</sup> Altered gene expression and protein levels of one or more of these receptors and ligands have been identified in cancers of the lung, kidney, colon, blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, head and neck, breast, and prostate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111432874">11</xref>
</sup> Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are tyrosine kinases with 3 extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembraneous region and a cytoplasmic split tyrosine kinase, which is activated upon FGF ligand binding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111432874">12</xref>
</sup> Stromal cell-independent epithelial cell growth is accompanied by a switch in the splicing of FGFR2 from the IIIb to the IIIc isoform. The IIIb isoform is expressed in epithelial cells, while the IIIc is usually expressed in mesenchymal cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111432874">13</xref>
</sup> There is also the ectopic expression of FGF2, a ligand for the IIIc but not the IIIb receptor isoform, suggesting the establishment of autocrine growth stimulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111432874">14</xref>
</sup> Fibroblast growth factor receptors undergoing alternative splicing generate a considerable number of isoforms with ligand specificity, determined according to deletions within the C-terminal sequences in the third immunoglobulin-like loop.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111432874">15</xref>
</sup> Several FGFR2b ligands have been implicated in this development, including FGF1, FGF7, and FGF10. Among these, FGF7 is a potent mitogen affecting cells in vitro in a manner comparable to that of hepatocyte growth factor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111432874">16</xref>
</sup> In vivo administration of FGF7 protein promotes a small degree of cell proliferation and enhances the efficiency of retrovirus infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111432874">17</xref>
</sup> Previous studies have indicated that FGF7 may exert mitogenic effects in hepatocytes during repair of liver injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111432874">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111432874">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this report, we investigate whether FGFRb downregulation induced by HPV16 E6/7 infection contributes to the tumorigenesis of malignant cells in human cervical cancer. The aim was to develop a scientific basis with which to provide technical support for cervical cancer therapy.</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Normal cervical epithelial cells (Epi) and cervical cancer cells were obtained from patients admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) Medical Center to undergo surgery for benign uterine neoplasm. All patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. Specimens were removed only from typical and clinically clear-cut (grade II) cases. Prior written informed consent was obtained from patients and all procedures were reviewed and approved by the ethics board at NCKU in adherence to Helsinki Principles.</p>
<p>Following surgery, cervical tissue was dissected and immersed in a culture medium for the preparation of normal cervical epithelial cells. The Cx cell is a cervical cancer cell line established by Prof C Y Chou.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111432874">20</xref>
</sup> The cells were obtained from a 48-year-old Taiwanese female with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, characterized as HPV negative and p53 mutation negative. CxWJ cells were established using a stable clone from Cx cells transfected with an amphotropic LXSN retroviral vector expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111432874">20</xref>
</sup> The CxWJ tumor cells were subsequently selected by G418 at 200 ng/mL for 2 days and 50 ng/mL for an additional 3 days before further serial passages. CxWJ cells had spindle-like shape morphologically and a short doubling time compared with parental Cx cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111432874">21</xref>
</sup> CaSKi and SiHa cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained on culture dishes, in a culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovie serum (FBS). The cells were cultured in an incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.</p>

<title>Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>A reverse transcriptase system (Promega, Southampon, UK) was used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from 1 μg of total RNA. Between 2 and 4 μL of cDNA were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Polymerase chain reactions (50 μL) were performed using 100 ng of each primer and 1 unit of dynazyme II (Flowgen, Lichfield, UK). Thermal cycling was conducted for 30 cycles at the following temperature/durations: 94°C for 1 minute, 65°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1 minute using a Progene thermal cycler (Cambridge, UK). A final extension at 72°C was performed for 10 minutes at the end of 30 cycles. The primers used for amplification of the human FGF receptor genes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719111432874">Table 1</xref>. All primers were checked against all other FGFR sequences for specificity. Polymerase chain reactions were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide/Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) minigels using the mini-Protean system (BioRad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and stained using 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide. Gels were visualized using an Apligene UV CCD camera system and PCR products were sequenced using the pmol DNA Cycle Sequencing System (Promega) to ensure specificity.</p>

<title>Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>Real-time PCR was conducted using SYBR Green PCR MasterMix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using approximately 200 ng of SYBR Green PCR MasterMix in an ABI Prism 7900 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 94°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds for 40 cycles. Sample cells from 3 plates were run in duplicate, using the threshold suggested by the software for the instrument to calculate Ct. To normalize readings, we used Ct values from 18 seconds as internal controls for each run, obtaining a delta Ct value for each gene.</p>

<title>Cell Proliferation Assay</title>
<p>Cells were seeded onto culture plates at 5000 cells/well. Individual cell wells were treated with 0, 25, and 100 ng/mL FGF-7 for 24 hours. The number of cells was determined microscopically and counted using a hemocytometer. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium MTS dye (1 mg/mL) was added to each well for an additional 4 hours following treatment. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and optical density was measured at 492 nm using a multiwell plate reader (Powerwave XS, Biotek), subtracting the background absorbance of the medium in the absence of cells. All samples were assayed in at least triplicate to calculate the mean for each experiment. Each assay was performed in triplicate and the results are expressed as mean (± standard error of the mean [SEM]).</p>

<p>FGFR type B (1b, 2b, and 3b) gene expression was analyzed in normal cervical epithelial (Epi) and cancer cells using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.

<title>HPV Infection Increases Tumor Formation in SCID Mice</title>
<p>Following injection of SCID mice with Cx and CxWJ cells, macroscopic tumors were observed from day 0 to 30, at which point, no mice had died and the tumors were resected and measured. The average size of tumors in the Cx group was 25.92%, smaller than those in the CxWJ group (100%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111432874">Figure 3B</xref>; *<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 vs Cx group). Small pale nodules were observed in all of the tumors, with large, red, hypervascularized tumors present in the nodules of CxWJ tumors but not in those of the Cx tumors (data not shown). These results indicate that HPV infection may increase tumorigenesis through the neovascularization of tumors in vivo. The gene expression <italic>FGF2</italic> and <italic>FGFR1</italic> in Cx and CxWJ tumor nodules was analyzed by RT-PCR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111432874">Figure 3C</xref> illustrates an increase in <italic>FGF2</italic> and <italic>FGFR1</italic> gene expression in CxWJ tumor nodules but not in Cx tumor nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111432874">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that FGF2 and FGFR1 gene expression was upregulated in cervical cancer cells in vivo. HPV 16 E6/E7 transfection enhanced the gene expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 more in CxWJ cells than in Cx cells. HPV infection in the tumorgenesis of cervical cancer induces <italic>FGF2</italic> gene expression and reduces <italic>FGFRb</italic> gene expression and plays an important role in cervical tumorgenesis induced by FGFRb downregulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cervical cancer remains a fatal disease despite considerable advances in treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111432874">24</xref>
</sup> Upon infection with HPV, cervical epithelial cells develop from premalignant cervical lesions to malignant invasive cancer via a multistep process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111432874">25</xref>
</sup> from normal, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I (mild), to CIN II (moderate), CIN III (severe), and finally invasive cervical carcinoma. Fortunately, most cases of CIN do not develop into cervical cancer and tend to develop only if appropriate treatment is not received.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111432874">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Studies have indicated that ovarian tumors produce FGF-7, a growth factor capable of binding to FGFRb, which are expressed in ovarian cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111432874">27</xref>
</sup> Little is known about the role of the FGF-7 in the maintenance or progression of carcinogenesis. FGF-7, however, can only activate FGFR2b.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111432874">28</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the cell growth in CxWJ cells is slower than Cx cells by FGF-7 treatment in vitro but not in vivo. This study investigated the role of HPV-infected cervical cancer and its synergistic effect on B type FGFR. A loss of B type FGFR noted in CxWJ cells results in a different response to FGF-7 ligand and a decrease in invasive ability in vitro. In vivo study, unknown ligands or FGFs family are possibly involved in this response. Further study concerning changes in the epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics will be required to elucidate the role of FGFR alteration in cervical carcinogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111432874">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Fibroblast growth factor 2 is involved in various stages of neovascularization by promoting differentiation and growth. Secretion of FGF2 has been described in both tumor and infiltrating inflammatory cells (macrophages).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111432874">30</xref>
</sup> When secreted from tumor cells, FGF2 is responsible for the metastasis of malignant cells,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111432874">31</xref>
</sup> observable in highly metastatic prostate cells and uterine endometrial cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111432874">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our results indicate that HPV 16 E6/7 transfection of CxWJ cells causes them to respond differently to FGF7 ligand stimulation, resulting in a decrease in growth and invasive ability. Further study regarding changes in epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics will be required to elucidate the role of HPV16 E6/7 in FGFRb and FGF2 alteration in cervical carcinogenesis.</p>

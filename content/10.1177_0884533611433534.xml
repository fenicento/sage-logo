<abstract>
<p>Zinc is an essential trace element required for normal cell growth, development, and differentiation. It is involved in DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and cell division and activation. It is a critical component in many zinc protein/enzymes, including critical zinc transcription factors. Zinc deficiency/altered metabolism is observed in many types of liver disease, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and viral liver disease. Some of the mechanisms for zinc deficiency/altered metabolism include decreased dietary intake, increased urinary excretion, activation of certain zinc transporters, and induction of hepatic metallothionein. Zinc deficiency may manifest itself in many ways in liver disease, including skin lesions, poor wound healing/liver regeneration, altered mental status, or altered immune function. Zinc supplementation has been documented to block/attenuate experimental ALD through multiple processes, including stabilization of gut-barrier function, decreasing endotoxemia, decreasing proinflammatory cytokine production, decreasing oxidative stress, and attenuating apoptotic hepatocyte death. Clinical trials in human liver disease are limited in size and quality, but it is clear that zinc supplementation reverses clinical signs of zinc deficiency in patients with liver disease. Some studies suggest improvement in liver function in both ALD and hepatitis C following zinc supplementation, and 1 study suggested improved fibrosis markers in hepatitis C patients. The dose of zinc used for treatment of liver disease is usually 50 mg of elemental zinc taken with a meal to decrease the potential side effect of nausea.</p>

<p>Zinc is the second most prevalent trace element in the body. It is integrally involved in the normal life cycle and has many important regulatory, catalytic, and defensive functions. Zinc was shown to be an essential trace nutrient for rodents in the 1930s and in humans in 1963, and it plays a catalytic role in a host of enzymes. Zinc plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression through metal-binding transcription factors and metal response elements in the promoter regions of the regulated genes. Zinc also plays a critical role in zinc-finger motifs. Zinc fingers typically have 4 cysteines within the protein that allow zinc to be bound in a tetrahedral complex.</p>
<p>Liver disease, especially alcoholic liver disease (ALD), has been associated with hypozincemia and zinc deficiency for more than half a century.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611433534">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611433534">2</xref></sup> These early ALD observations were confirmed by multiple investigators, and tissue concentrations of zinc have been demonstrated to be decreased in alcoholic cirrhosis as well as animal models of liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611433534">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611433534">11</xref></sup> This article updates these early observations on dysregulated zinc metabolism in liver disease with new advances in this area and will review (1) clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency and their relevance to liver disease, (2) zinc metabolism, (3) zinc and ALD, (4) zinc and viral liver disease, (5) zinc and other liver diseases, and (6) general recommendations concerning zinc supplementation and overall conclusions.</p>
<p>Much of our knowledge concerning the metabolic functions of zinc in humans is derived from manifestations of zinc deficiency in zinc-deficient animals, in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica (a hereditary disease of impaired zinc absorption), or in patients with acquired zinc deficiency due to an underlying disease process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611433534">12</xref></sup> It is also becoming clear that clinical and biochemical manifestations of zinc deficiency often occur when some stress is placed on the organism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611433534">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611433534">14</xref></sup> In liver disease, this stress may occur through increased gut permeability with endotoxemia, infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or release of stress hormones.

<title>Skin Lesions</title>
<p>The effects of zinc deficiency are particularly obvious on the skin, as manifested by an erythematous rash or scaly plaques. Many common dermatological conditions (eg, dandruff, acne, diaper rash) have been associated with zinc deficiency or effectively treated with zinc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611433534">15</xref></sup> Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by skin lesions, alopecia, failure to thrive, diarrhea, impaired immune function with frequent infections, and, in some cases, ocular abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611433534">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533611433534">19</xref></sup> The skin lesions (acrodermatitis) tend to occur around the eyes, nose, and mouth; over the buttocks and perianal regions; and sometimes in an acral distribution. The signs and symptoms of AE are caused by zinc deficiency due to impaired intestinal absorption of zinc. AE is caused by mutations of the SLC39A4 gene on the chromosome band 8q24.3, encoding a zinc transporter in humans (Zip4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533611433534">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with ALD and other forms of liver disease are predisposed to develop the skin lesions of zinc deficiency because of marginal underlying total body zinc stores. Several cases of acrodermatitis also have been reported in alcoholics with or without liver disease who were not receiving zinc in their hyperalimentation solutions or who had inadequate dietary intake of zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533611433534">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533611433534">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533611433534">24</xref></sup></p>

<p>Zinc deficiency is also associated with necrolytic acral erythema (NAE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533611433534">25</xref></sup> NAE is a recently recognized dermatosis, presenting in the form of pruritic, symmetric, well-demarcated, hyperkeratotic, erythematous-to-violaceous, lichenified plaques with a rim of dusky erythema on the dorsal aspects of the feet and extending to the toes. NAE is associated with decreased serum and skin zinc levels and is almost always associated with HCV infection, thereby serving as a cutaneous marker for underlying HCV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533611433534">26</xref></sup> Use of oral zinc therapy is highly effective and leads to NAE resolution in combination with treatment of the underlying HCV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533611433534">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Depressed Mental Function and Encephalopathy</title>
<p>Early studies by Henkin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533611433534">28</xref></sup> reported that experimentally induced zinc deficiency in humans may be accompanied by apathy or irritability, which is reversed with zinc supplementation. Similarly, children with AE may have apathy or confusion, which responds to zinc supplementation. We have observed patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) who developed severe depression or confusion and severe hypozincemia. Marked improvement in mental status coincided with zinc supplementation in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533611433534">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533611433534">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Portal systemic (hepatic) encephalopathy (PSE) is a derangement of mental function caused by liver disease or shunting of blood around the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533611433534">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533611433534">31</xref></sup> This disordered mental state ranges in severity from intellectual impairment detectable only by careful psychometric testing to frank coma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533611433534">29</xref></sup> Gut-derived toxins such as ammonia, mercaptans, short-chain fatty acids, false neurotransmitters, metabolites of tryptophan, and others are postulated to play an etiological role in this disordered mental status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533611433534">29</xref></sup> Patients with cirrhosis have depressed serum zinc levels, and those with hepatic encephalopathy have statistically reduced serum zinc concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533611433534">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533611433534">33</xref></sup> Zinc is integrally involved in the metabolism of ammonia. Zinc deficiency markedly decreases activity of the urea cycle enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase, and zinc supplementation corrects this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533611433534">34</xref></sup> Similarly, zinc deficiency has been reported to impair activity of muscle glutamine synthetase, which causes hyperammonemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533611433534">35</xref></sup> Glutamine synthetase activity has also been reported to be decreased in patients with encephalopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533611433534">36</xref></sup> Several trials have reported using zinc supplementation in various stages of PSE with somewhat inconsistent results. In the most recent large randomized clinical trial, polaprezinc supplementation plus standard therapy for 6 months (compared with standard therapy alone, protein-restricted diet with branched-chain amino acids and lactulose) was associated with a significant improvement in encephalopathy grade, blood ammonia levels, serum albumin levels, and a variety of psychomotor performance tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533611433534">37</xref></sup> Last, overt hepatic encephalopathy has been induced in a subject by creating zinc deficiency, and encephalopathy was then reversed with zinc supplementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533611433534">38</xref></sup></p>

<title>Impaired Night Vision</title>
<p>Impaired night vision has been recognized in alcoholic cirrhotics since the late 1930s, and this has been confirmed in recent studies in many types of cirrhosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533611433534">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533611433534">41</xref></sup> This is usually associated with vitamin A deficiency, and vitamin A supplementation improved night vision. Several groups, including our own, have shown that some individuals with cirrhosis require not only vitamin A but also zinc supplementation to correct or improve their dark adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533611433534">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533611433534">43</xref></sup> Zinc and vitamin A interact on many different levels, including production of retinol-binding protein and activity of retinol dehydrogenase. Studies in zinc-deficient experimental animals also demonstrated progressive anatomic deterioration of the retina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533611433534">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533611433534">45</xref></sup> Similar retinal degeneration was observed in a patient with AE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533611433534">46</xref></sup> Thus, there is strong clinical and experimental evidence that zinc affects retinal function, and zinc supplementation may improve dark adaptation in some patients with liver disease.</p>

<title>Anorexia With Altered Taste/Smell</title>
<p>A major and initial manifestation of zinc deficiency is anorexia with subsequent weight loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533611433534">47</xref></sup> The mechanism(s) by which zinc deficiency produces anorexia is unknown. Initially, alterations in taste acuity and in circulating amino acids were implicated as etiologic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533611433534">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533611433534">49</xref></sup> We showed that zinc deficiency in the rat affected catecholamine levels in total brain and in specific regions of the hypothalamus. We demonstrated that zinc-deficient animals are resistant to the central administration of known inducers of food intake such as norepinephrine and muscimol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533611433534">50</xref></sup> Zinc is extremely important for normal membrane structure and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0884533611433534">51</xref></sup> We speculated that there is a decrease in receptor responsivity in the zinc-deficient animal, possibly secondary to alterations in membrane fluidity, which may explain, at least partially, the severe anorexia noted in these animals.</p>
<p>Patients with alcoholic liver disease frequently complain of anorexia and have decreased food consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533611433534">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533611433534">53</xref></sup> Patients with acute liver disease also frequently complain of unpleasant olfactory and gustatory sensations, and this usually improves as the liver disease resolves. Burch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0884533611433534">54</xref></sup> reported decreased taste and smell acuity in cirrhotics with hypozincemia. Smith et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0884533611433534">55</xref></sup> demonstrated objective disordered gustatory acuity in both viral hepatitis patients and patients with chronic liver disease (both groups had hypozincemia).</p>

<title>Hypogonadism</title>
<p>Zinc deficiency is a well-recognized cause of hypogonadism in experimental animals and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533611433534">56</xref></sup> Chronic alcoholics with and without liver disease and other patients with liver disease of multiple etiologies may have hypogonadism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0884533611433534">57</xref></sup> The hypogonadism of zinc deficiency appears to be primarily a gonadal defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533611433534">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0884533611433534">58</xref></sup> Adequate levels of gonadotrophins and intact gonadotrophin response to luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone have been demonstrated in zinc-deficient animals. Zinc-deficient animals have reduced basal testosterone levels and depressed weights of testes and other androgen-sensitive organs compared with zinc-sufficient controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0884533611433534">58</xref></sup> Humans fed a zinc-deficient diet developed decreased libido, depressed serum testosterone levels, and marked reduction in sperm counts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0884533611433534">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0884533611433534">60</xref></sup> Moreover, zinc supplementation significantly increased serum testosterone in elderly men with marginal zinc deficiency.

<title>Depressed Wound Healing</title>
<p>The role of zinc in nucleic acid metabolism, in the synthesis of structural proteins such as collagen, and in a host of enzymatic pathways makes zinc balance important for wound healing. A clinical role for zinc in wound healing was initially postulated by Pories et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0884533611433534">63</xref></sup> with the observation of improved healing of pilonidal sinuses with zinc administration. Subsequent controlled studies by Hallböök and Lanner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0884533611433534">64</xref></sup> demonstrated that zinc supplementation improved wound healing in patients with both venous leg ulcers and decreased serum zinc concentrations. Several investigators then reported depressed wound healing in experimental animal models (eg, thermal and excised wounds, gastric ulcers) in zinc-deficient compared to zinc-sufficient animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0884533611433534">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0884533611433534">66</xref></sup> Recent studies have supported the important clinical role of zinc in wound healing, especially in leg ulcers.</p>
<p>Hepatocyte regeneration after liver injury represents a form of wound healing. After partial hepatectomy or liver injury, hepatocytes undergo a synchronized, multistep process consisting of priming/initiation, proliferation, and termination. These steps are essential for restoring the structure and functions of the liver. The regenerating liver requires a large amount of zinc over a short period of time. This demand is met, in part, by induction of the zinc/copper binding protein metallothionein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0884533611433534">67</xref></sup> Metallothionein can transfer zinc to various metalloenzymes and transcription factors, and metallothionein knockout mice have impaired liver regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0884533611433534">68</xref></sup> Thus, zinc is essential for wound healing at peripheral sites as well as for liver regeneration.</p>

<title>Altered Immune Function</title>
<p>The effect of zinc deficiency on immune function in humans was initially studied in children with AE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0884533611433534">69</xref></sup> Leukocyte function and cell-mediated immunity were impaired in these children and corrected with zinc supplementation. Golden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0884533611433534">70</xref></sup> described thymic atrophy in children with protein energy malnutrition and zinc deficiency, and this thymic atrophy reversed with zinc supplementation. We reported 2 patients who developed severe zinc deficiency with acrodermatitis while on PN. These patients had cutaneous anergy and markedly depressed T cell response to phytohemaglutinin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0884533611433534">71</xref></sup> which corrected with zinc supplementation alone.</p>
<p>Results from these early human studies have been supported by a variety of in vitro and animal research documenting a critical role for zinc in multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. Well-established effects of zinc deficiency include thymic atrophy, alterations in thymic hormones, lymphopenia, and compromised cellular and antibody-mediated responses, which can result in increased rates and duration of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0884533611433534">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0884533611433534">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies in experimental animals and humans support the concepts of dysregulated zinc metabolism during infections and zinc deficiency increasing morbidity and mortality following infection. Work from Knoell’s laboratory showed that zinc deficiency increases systemic inflammation, organ damage, and mortality in a small animal model of sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0884533611433534">75</xref></sup> Using a cecal ligation and puncture model, they showed that zinc-deficient animals had increased bacterial burden, enhanced nuclear factor–κB (NF-κB)–binding activity, increased expression of NF-κB-targeted genes such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and ICAM-1, and increased acute-phase proteins. Similarly, genome-level expression profiling in patients with pediatric septic shock demonstrated that altered zinc homeostasis predicted poor outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0884533611433534">76</xref></sup> Of the genes most prominently up- or downregulated, many play important roles in zinc homeostasis.

<title>Zinc Metabolism</title>
<p>Zinc is an essential nutrient for a broad range of biological activities. In the United States, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 8 mg/d for women and 11 mg/d for men older than age 19. Red meats, especially beef, lamb, and liver, as well as certain sea foods (eg, oysters), have some of the highest concentrations of zinc in food. Zinc and dietary protein directly correlate with each other. Patients with liver disease, especially ALD, often have poor diets that are low in protein and low in zinc. Moreover, some dietary fibers/phytates can reduce zinc absorption. Absorption of zinc is concentration dependent and occurs throughout the small intestine (mainly the jejunum). Absorption may be impaired in cirrhosis, and typically there is increased urinary excretion of zinc in cirrhosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611433534">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zinc absorption, transfer, and excretion are accomplished by 2 large classes of transporters that tend to have opposing effects (ZnT proteins and Zip transporters).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0884533611433534">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0884533611433534">77</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0884533611433534">79</xref></sup> The Zip family of transporters move zinc from the extracellular space into the cellular cytoplasm. Indeed, Zip4 plays a major role in intestinal zinc absorption, and a lack of this transporter causes acrodermatitis enteropathica. The ZnT proteins generally work in opposition to the Zip transporters.</p>
<p>Zinc status and the serum zinc level drop with low dietary zinc intake. There normally are multiple mechanisms in place to protect against zinc deficiency, including increased absorption and decreased excretion via modification of zinc transporters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0884533611433534">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0884533611433534">79</xref></sup> Zinc status is typically assessed by plasma/serum zinc concentration. However, inflammation/stress hormones may cause a decrease in serum zinc level, with an internal redistribution of the zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533611433534">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611433534">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611433534">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0884533611433534">79</xref></sup> This stress response is often associated with hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is a major binding protein for zinc, but the serum zinc concentration will decrease with an inflammatory stimulus even in the absence of hypoalbuminemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533611433534">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611433534">13</xref></sup> This is mediated at least in part by changes in zinc transporters, especially induction of Zip14 and induction of hepatic metallothionein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0884533611433534">73</xref></sup> Metallothionein is a metal-binding protein that serves many functions, including zinc transport, antioxidant activity, and modulation of zinc absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611433534">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0884533611433534">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0884533611433534">79</xref></sup> Indeed, ingestion of pharmacologic amounts of zinc causes induction of intestinal metallothionein, which then inhibits intestinal copper uptake and induces negative copper balance in the treatment of Wilson disease (discussed subsequently).</p>

However, there is still no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved therapy for this common and often devastating disease. Interactions between the bowel, immune system, and the liver are critical components of ALD. In this model, chronic alcoholism results in changes to the intestinal epithelial barrier, leading to increased gut permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0884533611433534">83</xref></sup> Subsequently, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, translocates across the disrupted intestinal barrier and enters the portal venous circulation to stimulate primed Kupffer cells. This results in both proinflammatory cytokine production and generation of reactive oxygen species, key mediators of ALD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0884533611433534">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0884533611433534">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0884533611433534">83</xref></sup> Zinc deficiency is well documented in both humans with alcoholic cirrhosis and in animal models of ALD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611433534">8</xref></sup> In a representative human study, the serum zinc concentration in alcoholic patients was 7.52 µmol/L, which was significantly lower than 12.69 µmol/L in control subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0884533611433534">84</xref></sup> Moreover, the decrease in serum zinc correlates with progression of liver damage.

<p>Because of the above-noted findings, we carried out a series of studies to determine whether zinc deficiency is related to the deleterious effects of alcohol on the intestinal barrier.

Reduction of tight-junction proteins in the ileal epithelium was observed in alcohol-fed mice. Alcohol exposure significantly reduced the ileal zinc concentration in association with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Using in vitro studies, Caco-2 cell cultures demonstrated that alcohol exposure increased the intracellular free zinc because of oxidative stress.

Zinc acetate was approved for maintenance therapy by the FDA in 1997, based on research that showed that zinc caused a negative copper balance, controlled urine and plasma copper levels, removed stored copper, and protected the liver, at least in part, by inducing the expression of intestinal and hepatic metallothionein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0884533611433534">121</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0884533611433534">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>Metallothionein is mainly a cytosolic peptide with a high cysteine content that binds metals such as zinc and copper quite avidly (copper having a higher affinity). In the cytosol of enterocytes, metallothionein binds newly absorbed copper and prevents it from passing from the intestine into the circulation. Shed enterocytes with copper still bound to metallothionein then result in a high fecal copper content and loss of copper from the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0884533611433534">121</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0884533611433534">123</xref></sup> The dose that is frequently used for adults with Wilson disease is 50 mg elemental zinc 3 times a day. The multiple dosing regimen is critical to impair copper absorption. Many investigators have also used zinc therapy for primary treatment of Wilson disease. However, recent communications have suggested that some patients are resistant to zinc therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0884533611433534">124</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0884533611433534">126</xref></sup> Moreover, compliance is often an issue, especially in asymptomatic patients on long-term therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0884533611433534">124</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0884533611433534">126</xref></sup> Thus, if zinc is to be used for Wilson disease therapy (especially primary therapy), careful patient monitoring and documentation of compliance are critical. Zinc therapy is an attractive therapeutic agent because it is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic compared to chelation therapy.</p>

<title>Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
<p>HCC is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and the ninth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0884533611433534">127</xref></sup> Its incidence and mortality rates in the United States are increasing. The survival rate continues to be dismal with an overall 5-year survival of only 13%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0884533611433534">128</xref></sup> The high mortality is due to late-stage detection of this cancer when most of the therapies available are not effective. Globally, 78% of HCC can be attributed to chronic HBV and chronic HCV viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0884533611433534">129</xref></sup> In United States, alcoholism is the most common cause of HCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0884533611433534">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several groups have reported decreased serum levels of zinc in HCC patients. In a case-control study comparing patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and benign digestive disease, serum levels of Zn in patients with HCC were significantly lower than in those patients with benign digestive disease and similar to levels in cirrhotic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0884533611433534">131</xref></sup> Nakayama et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0884533611433534">132</xref></sup> reported depressed levels of zinc in patients with chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma compared to healthy volunteers. They also tested the metallothionein levels of these individuals and found that patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma had levels significantly lower than those in patients with chronic hepatitis and controls. When levels of zinc in HCC tumor tissue were studied, they were found to be significantly decreased compared to surrounding nontumor tissue, and levels in nontumor tissue were significantly lower than normal liver tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0884533611433534">133</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0884533611433534">141</xref></sup> Kubo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0884533611433534">142</xref></sup> investigated metallothionein (MT) levels by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis in resected HCC tumors, surrounding noncancerous but diseased hepatic tissue, and normal liver tissue obtained from autopsies done on patients with no liver disease. They found that MT existed mainly as Zn-MT in normal hepatic tissue, whereas in the noncancerous parenchyma surrounding HCC, the Zn-MT was replaced to a significant extent by Cu,Zn-MT. In the cancerous tissue, the Cu,Zn- MT was largely displaced by Cu-MT, and Zn-MT was undetectable.</p>
<p>It is unclear if these changes in serum and tissue zinc concentrations contribute to the initiation or promotion of HCC or whether they are the effects of malignant transformation. Studies are under way to try to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Somewhat conflicting data have emerged. Most recently, Franklin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0884533611433534">143</xref></sup> have reported a downregulation of ZIP14 gene expression and the near absence of the protein within hepatoma cells in core biopsy samples, which could explain the decrease in intracellular zinc levels in HCC. ZIP14 localizes to the cell membrane of normal hepatocytes and is a functional transmembrane transporter involved in the uptake of zinc into the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0884533611433534">144</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0884533611433534">145</xref></sup> Thus, its downregulation may explain the decreased zinc levels in hepatoma cells. Because Zn has been proposed to have anticancer properties in multiple systems, the authors suggest that intracellular levels of zinc are downregulated early in HCC to suppress its antitumor effect. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 does not lose the ZIP14 transporter. Interestingly, exposure of HepG2 cells to even physiologic concentrations of Zn (5 µM) inhibits their growth by about 80%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0884533611433534">143</xref></sup> On the other hand, Weaver et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0884533611433534">146</xref></sup> observed an upregulation of the zinc transporter ZIP4 gene expression in human and mouse HCC tissue compared with surrounding noncancerous tissue. In fact, ZIP4 protein was rarely found in noncancerous tissue, but it was abundant in the cancerous tissue. They then inhibited ZIP4 in Hepa cells (mouse hepatoma cell line) using a RNAi-expressing lentivirus vector, and this increased apoptosis and modestly slowed progression from G0/G1 to S phase when these cells were released from the hydroxyurea block into the zinc-deficient medium but not in the zinc-adequate medium. Furthermore, migration of these cells through a fibronectin-coated membrane was inhibited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0884533611433534">146</xref></sup> Unfortunately, they did not measure zinc levels in these samples, so it is not known how the aberrant expression of ZIP4 in HCC tissue noted in this study affected tumor zinc levels.</p>

<title>Conclusions and General Recommendations</title>
<p>Zinc deficiency occurs in many types of liver disease, especially more advanced/decompensated disease. Zinc supplementation has been best studied in experimental models of ALD where it blocks most mechanisms of liver injury, including increased gut permeability, endotoxemia, oxidative stress, excess TNF production, and hepatocyte apoptosis. Zinc may have some limited antiviral effect in HCV therapy. Importantly, zinc therapy has shown some promising antifibrotic effects in chronic HCV. The dose of zinc we currently administer is 50 mg of elemental zinc (220 mg zinc sulfate) per day orally with a meal. Because of its effects on multiple targets and its relative lack of toxicity, we tend to give zinc long-term (months to years) or at least until the serum zinc level has normalized. Multiple forms of zinc are available, with some of the most widely used including zinc sulfate, zinc gluconate, zinc acetate, zinc picolinate, and others. To our knowledge, zinc acetate is the only zinc supplement requiring a prescription, and extensive information on these supplements, including tablet dosing, is available on the Internet.</p>
<p>Most forms of zinc salts have nausea and epigastric distress as potential side effects. Consuming zinc with a meal or switching types of supplements (eg, switch from zinc sulfate to zinc gluconate or acetate) may lessen these symptoms. We use a once-daily dose of 50 mg elemental zinc to not inhibit copper absorption. In Wilson disease, split doses (usually 50 mg of elemental zinc 3 times per day, separated from meals) are required to cause appropriate reduction in copper burden. Moreover, it appears that some patients may not be zinc responsive, and adherence to therapy and careful monitoring are absolutely critical.</p>

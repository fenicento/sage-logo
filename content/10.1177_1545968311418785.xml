<p><italic>Background</italic>. Individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) are predisposed to muscle fatigue during voluntary exercise. However, the origin of fatigue is unclear. <italic>Objective</italic>. The authors examined the motoneuron excitability, muscle activation level, and fatigue properties of the flexor carpi radialis muscle, just below the level of injury. <italic>Methods</italic>. Nine individuals with chronic, incomplete cervical cord injury and 9 age-matched healthy individuals were recruited. The authors tested maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), motoneuron excitability by the maximum amplitude of the H-reflex (Hmax at C-7), and muscle voluntary activation level measured by the interpolated twitch technique. Subjects were fatigued by repetitive maximal voluntary isometric wrist flexion. General fatigue index (GFI), central fatigue index (CFI), and peripheral fatigue index (PFI) of flexor carpi radialis were examined before, during, and immediately after exercise. <italic>Results</italic>. The Hmax in the SCI group was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = .0028) than in controls. The MVC (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and voluntary activation level (<italic>P</italic> = .016) in the SCI group were significantly lower. The GFI and CFI decreased in both the SCI and the non-SCI groups. The PFI in the SCI group was significantly higher (ie, less fatigue) than that in controls at 30 repetitive contractions. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. In individuals with incomplete SCI, the deficit in central drive is an important source of muscle weakness and fatigue in the muscle below the level of injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) have muscle weakness or paralysis below the level of injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1545968311418785">1</xref></sup> In SCI cases with partial paralysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1545968311418785">1</xref></sup> motoneuron death and muscle denervation may occur in weakened muscles around the level of lesion, which may enhance the fatigability during exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968311418785">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1545968311418785">3</xref></sup> Several factors, such as reduction of motivation, motoneuron excitability, and the contractile properties of muscle, have been proposed to cause activity-dependent fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1545968311418785">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1545968311418785">5</xref></sup> Butler and Thomas suggested that the decreases in motoneuron excitability during electrical stimulation-induced fatigue for paralyzed muscles in SCI subjects were a result of activity-dependent changes in motoneuron properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545968311418785">6</xref></sup> However, for those partially preserved muscles below the neurological level in incomplete SCI, the cause of weakness and the origin of fatigue are unclear.</p>
<p>Few studies have been done to investigate the fatigue properties in individuals with incomplete SCI. Cameron and Calancie used an electrical stimulator delivering 126 trains of stimuli to fatigue the wrist flexors of individuals with incomplete C3-C6 cord injury. They found that the peak isometric force was less in the SCI group than in the non-SCI group, but the force decline pattern was comparable between the 2 groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1545968311418785">7</xref></sup> This suggests that peripheral fatigue might not be a primary cause. Thomas et al analyzed the mean forces and integrated EMGs generated during 5 brief submaximal and 5 maximal triceps brachii voluntary contractions (MVCs) for 7 to 8 seconds each in individuals with chronic cervical SCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968311418785">2</xref></sup> The mean forces and integrated EMGs generated by those with SCI were significantly less than those of controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968311418785">2</xref></sup> This suggests that impaired central activation and/or central fatigue might be important, but these have not been quantified in incomplete SCI individuals.</p>
<p>The H-reflex measures the excitability of monosynaptic reflex loop with Ia afferent synapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545968311418785">8</xref></sup> Although the H-reflex could be modulated by suprasegmental drive, the motoneuron excitability at the spinal cord level is commonly quantified by the maximum amplitude of the H-reflex (Hmax). The H-reflex evoked in the flexor carpi radialis assesses the C-7 motoneuron level and median nerve function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1545968311418785">9</xref></sup> The Hmax is commonly normalized by dividing the Hmax with maximum M-waves (Mmax) to eliminate the influence of neuromuscular transmission and to correlate with motoneuron excitability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1545968311418785">10</xref></sup> An adapted increase in H-reflex amplitude has been found in patients with central nervous system lesions. Whether it has functional meaning, that is, compensation for impaired central activation or alleviating central fatigue, is not clear.</p>
<p>The muscle voluntary activation level represents the completeness of the muscle activation during voluntary contraction and can be analyzed by the interpolated twitch technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1545968311418785">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1545968311418785">11</xref></sup> The interpolated twitch technique records the force response after applying a single supramaximal electrical stimulus to the nerve, superimposed during a sustained maximal voluntary contraction. The supramaximal stimulus recruits motor units that have not been recruited and generates a superimposed twitch force response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1545968311418785">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fatigue can be defined as central fatigue and peripheral fatigue. Peripheral fatigue represents processes within the muscle, whereas central fatigue represents the decline of the level of voluntary activation of muscle. The 2 types can be quantified by the postexercise declination ratio of the twitch force elicited by electrical stimulation and declination ratio of the voluntary activation level, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1545968311418785">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1545968311418785">15</xref></sup> In healthy subjects, both peripheral and central fatigue impair maximal voluntary contraction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545968311418785">16</xref></sup> but this has not been investigated after incomplete SCI during volitional activities.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that subjects after SCI would have higher motoneuron excitability, decreased muscle activation level, and more general fatigue, central fatigue, and peripheral fatigue after exercise than healthy control subjects. Knowing the limitation factors (ie, central or peripheral fatigue) for individuals with incomplete SCI, clinicians may be able to develop rehabilitation programs to lessen fatigability.</p>

<title>H-reflex and M-wave</title>
<p>Subjects sat on a chair with the elbow flexed to 90° to 100° and forearm supinated. The surface electromyography (EMG) of the flexor carpi radialis was recorded by a bipolar electrode with a fixed interelectrode distance of 2 cm (B&amp;L Engineering, Santa Ana, CA). The recording electrode was located on the muscle belly of the flexor carpi radialis, parallel to the muscle fiber, and the reference electrode on the styloid process. The EMG activity was on-site preamplified with a factor of 350 and further amplified at the mainframe amplifier that had an input impedance greater than 10 MΩ, a common mode rejection ratio of 100 dB at 60 Hz, and a gain range from 0.5 to 100 000 times (Gould, Inc, Valley View, OH). The raw EMG data were fed through a 60-Hz notch filter and a band-pass (10-1000 Hz) filter to eliminate environmental interference and motion artifacts. EMG activity was monitored on an oscilloscope and digitized by a 16-bit resolution analog-to-digital converter (InstruNet Model 100, Input/Output A/D system, Somerville, MA) at 4000 Hz.</p>
<p>Electrical stimuli (ES) of 200-µs-width rectangular pulses were provided by an electrical stimulator (Digitimer DS7A, Digitimer Ltd, Hertfordshire, England). The cathode of the electrical stimulator was applied on the median nerve at the inner elbow joint, and the anode was on the olecranon. The stimulus intensity was initially low and was increased gradually until the maximum H-reflex (Hmax) was found. This intensity was used for eliciting Hmax throughout this study. Similarly, the stimulus intensity was gradually increased until the maximum M-wave (Mmax) was elicited. The supramaximum intensity was set at 120% of the intensity at which Mmax was elicited and was used throughout this study.</p>
<p>Peak-to-peak amplitude of the Hmax and Mmax were analyzed (Biopac AcqKnowledge version 3.8.1, Biopac System, Inc, Goleta, CA). To minimize the influence of interindividual variance, the Hmax was normalized by the Mmax. The Hmax/Mmax ratio represented the maximal percentage of alpha motoneurons that could be activated by electrical stimulation of Ia afferents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545968311418785">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1545968311418785">17</xref></sup> The Hmax/Mmax ratio is a common indicator used to represent neural adaptation in individuals with neurological disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1545968311418785">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1545968311418785">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Muscle force and muscle voluntary activation level</title>
<p>Subjects were seated with the elbows flexed at 90°. Their forearm, wrist, and palm were fixed on a wooden frame that was connected to a force transducer (BAB-50M, Transcell Technology, Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL) for recording muscle forces during isometric contractions. The recorded force signals were amplified by a Gould transducer amplifier (Gould Instrument System, Inc, Valley View, OH) and monitored on an oscilloscope and then digitized by a 16-bit resolution analog-to-digital converter (Instrunet) at 4000 Hz.</p>
<p>Before the fatigue test, 3 MVCs of flexor carpi radialis were recorded by holding for 4 seconds each and separated by 3 minutes of rest. Then, the initial voluntary activation level was assessed by the interpolated twitch technique to test whether a muscle was fully activated during a MVC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1545968311418785">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1545968311418785">23</xref></sup> Subjects were familiarized with supramaximal ES several times. Then, the subjects contracted their flexor carpi radialis to MVC and held for 4 seconds. During the initial 1 to 2 seconds of holding, supramaximal ES was applied to the median nerve to evoke a superimposed twitch force response (Ts). The Ts is generated from those motor units that have not yet been recruited. With increasing central drive to exert the force to a higher level, the Ts should become smaller and the voluntary activation level would be larger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1545968311418785">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1545968311418785">24</xref></sup> The supramaximum ES was also applied both before and after MVC of flexor carpi radialis to evoke 2 resting twitch force responses (Tr1 and Tr2). The Tr1 and Tr2 represent the unpotentiated and potentiated twitches, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1545968311418785">Figure 1</xref>). The Tr1 and Tr2 were averaged to represent the amplitude of resting twitch.

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 16, SPSS Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL). The nonparamatric Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to test the differences of Hmax, Mmax, Hmax/Mmax, MVC, voluntary activation level, GFI, CFI, and PFI between 2 groups. The Friedman test was used to test the changes of MVC, voluntary activation level, GFI, CFI, and PFI in different series of contractions (ie, time factor) during the fatigue protocol. A significance level was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. If significance was detected, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the pairwise differences between series of contractions with <italic>P</italic> value adjusted to &lt;.017. The correlation between GFI and CFI or PFI was analyzed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. A significance level was set at .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to quantify the central and peripheral sources of muscle weakness and fatigue in the muscle below the level of injury in individuals with incomplete SCI. This study found that the deficit of the central drive is an important source of muscle weakness and fatigue and could not be compensated by the increased alpha-motor neuron pool excitability. The major findings of this study are the following: (<italic>a</italic>) the MVC force and muscle activation level before fatigue exercise were significantly lower, but the Hmax and Hmax/Mmax were significantly higher in the SCI group than in the non-SCI group; (<italic>b</italic>) both the SCI and the non-SCI groups developed fatigue after repetitive isometric contractions; and (<italic>c</italic>) the non-SCI group developed both central fatigue and peripheral fatigue, whereas the SCI group developed only central fatigue.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the amplitude of H-reflex and M-wave of flexor carpi radialis in healthy subjects were about 0.36 to 2.23 mV and 4.29 to 7.6 mV, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1545968311418785">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1545968311418785">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1545968311418785">19</xref></sup> The results of our study were similar. The high Hmax and Hmax/Mmax in SCI were probably due to neural adaptation with central disinhibition and the release of presynaptic neurotransmitters to compensate for the loss of motor units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1545968311418785">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1545968311418785">31</xref></sup> However, the Hmax and Hmax/Mmax were associated with spasticity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1545968311418785">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1545968311418785">31</xref></sup> which might contribute to less voluntary contraction force of the muscle in SCI. Whether this high Hmax value was maintained during the fatigue exercise was not clear, because the H-reflex was not measured during the fatigue exercise in this study. Some studies showed that the normalized or standardized H-reflex did not change after fatigue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1545968311418785">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1545968311418785">33</xref></sup> but some studies showed that the H-reflex decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1545968311418785">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1545968311418785">35</xref></sup> The discrepancies could be explained by the methodology of the fatigue protocol and the measurement conditions of the H-reflex.</p>
<p>Our results found that the muscle MVC force in chronic, incomplete SCI was about half of that in the non-SCI individuals before and during fatigue exercise. This finding was consistent with that of Cameron and Calancie.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1545968311418785">7</xref></sup> The cause of the low MVC before and during fatigue exercise in SCI may be due to the reduction of sensory inputs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968311418785">2</xref></sup> the lack of extra activation of motoneurons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1545968311418785">5</xref></sup> and the loss of active motoneurons or the elevation of the threshold of residual motoneurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1545968311418785">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study showed that central fatigue (ie, decrease of CFI) evolved during the fatigue exercise in the SCI and control groups. However, the peripheral fatigue index, characterized by the declination of twitch force, was not significantly decreased in the incomplete SCI group. The twitch force was potentiated at 30 contractions, instead. Potentiation is characterized by the enhancement of muscle force following previous repetitive activation, which might be due to the myosin light chain phosphorylation, with increases of the number of attached cross bridges at submaximal calcium concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1545968311418785">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1545968311418785">38</xref></sup> Previous studies also demonstrate robust postfatigue potentiation in chronically paralyzed muscles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1545968311418785">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1545968311418785">41</xref></sup> The twitch potentiation in the present study suggested that the incomplete SCI individuals might suffer from sustained low-frequency fatigue before participation. Thus, repetitive isometric contractions did not induce further low-frequency fatigue in this study.</p>
<p>Greater neuromuscular fatigue might develop from isometric than concentric exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1545968311418785">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1545968311418785">42</xref></sup> The present study found a high correlation between central fatigue and general fatigue in both groups during repetitive isometric exercise. Thus, central fatigue might contribute to the reduced maximal voluntary contraction during fatigue exercise in both groups. The central fatigue in the SCI and the non-SCI groups might originate from the different proportions of supraspinal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545968311418785">16</xref></sup> and spinal components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968311418785">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1545968311418785">3</xref></sup> Other factors including metabolite (H+ and Pi) accumulation in muscle and a change of supraspinal descending drive might occur both in the SCI and the non-SCI individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1545968311418785">13</xref></sup> Future studies are needed to elucidate the different mechanisms of fatigue.</p>
<sec id="section17-1545968311418785">
<title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
<p>This study did not measure the H-reflex during the fatigue exercise. The main reason was that several H-reflexes would be necessary for averaging, but the consecutive H-reflexes had to be separated by 10 seconds to prevent postactivation depression. This delay would potentially interfere with the fatigue protocol and allow recovery of central fatigue. The measurement of H-reflex during fatigue exercise is suggested for future study. Furthermore, this study did not measure the motor cortex output to elucidate the central drive during the fatigue exercise. However, the strength of this study was to quantify both the central and peripheral fatigues. In addition, unlike ES-induced muscle contractions, the repetitive, brief, voluntary isometric wrist contractions resembled certain daily life activities, such as typing and writing, so the testing may be more relevant to rehabilitation strategies.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Deficits in activation failure are important sources of muscle weakness in individuals with chronic incomplete cervical SCI. Repetitive isometric wrist flexion caused central fatigue, which reduced voluntary contraction force in people with an SCI above the C-7 level. The influence of peripheral fatigue could not be totally excluded because subjects showed twitch potentiation. Strategies to reduce central fatigue of the muscles below the level of injury should be developed in clinical rehabilitation.</p>

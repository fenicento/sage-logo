<abstract>
<p>Social ecological models that describe the interactive characteristics of individuals and environments that underlie health outcomes have long been recommended to guide public health practice. The extent to which such recommendations have been applied in health promotion interventions, however, is unclear. The authors developed a coding system to identify the ecological levels that health promotion programs target and then applied this system to 157 intervention articles from the past 20 years of <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic>. Overall, articles were more likely to describe interventions focused on individual and interpersonal characteristics, rather than institutional, community, or policy factors. Interventions that focused on certain topics (nutrition and physical activity) or occurred in particular settings (schools) more successfully adopted a social ecological approach. Health education theory, research, and training may need to be enhanced to better foster successful efforts to modify social and political environments to improve health.</p>

<p>The health promotion field is often criticized for focusing on lifestyle change while ignoring contextual forces that influence health. Social ecological models recognize individuals as embedded within larger social systems and describe the interactive characteristics of individuals and environments that underlie health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111418634">Sallis, Owen, &amp; Fisher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111418634">Stokols, 1992</xref>). More than 20 years ago, an issue of this journal was dedicated to the exploration of an ecological model for health promotion. Building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111418634">Urie Brofenbrenner (1977)</xref>, who had previously articulated a multilevel framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111418634">McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, and Glanz (1988)</xref> offered five levels of influence specific to health behavior: intrapersonal factors, interpersonal processes and primary groups, institutional factors, community factors, and public policy.</p>
<p>In addition to articulating level-specific influences on health behavior, the authors described possible intervention strategies at each level of influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111418634">McLeroy et al., 1988</xref>). What is particularly important, they argued, is to conceptualize model levels as more than just settings for interventions. Specific individual and environmental changes sought by a program help identify the level of intervention. For example, the authors suggest that intrapersonal level interventions aim to change the knowledge, beliefs, and skills of individuals. Interpersonal-level and institutional-level interventions, by contrast, are designed to create change in social relationships and organizational environments. The authors propose that changes in communities derive from partnerships with agencies, churches, neighborhoods, and other mediating structures; the objective of community-focused interventions is usually to increase health services or empower disadvantaged groups. Finally, implementing public policies with health behavior implications or facilitating citizen advocacy are frequent targets of interventions at the public policy level.</p>
<p>Ecological models assume not only that multiple levels of influence exist but also that these levels are interactive and reinforcing. Stokols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111418634">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111418634">1996</xref>) argues that the social, physical, and cultural aspects of an environment have a cumulative effect on health. He further contends that the environment itself is multilayered, since institutions and neighborhoods are embedded in larger social and economic structures, and that the environmental context may influence the health of individual people differently, depending on their unique beliefs and practices. Creating sustainable health improvements, therefore, is most effective when all of these factors are targeted simultaneously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111418634">Stokols (1996)</xref>, however, notes that influencing all aspects of the environment and characteristics of an individual may be impractical and therefore recommends that interventions focus at least on two levels of influence.</p>
<p>McLeroy and Stokols are not alone in recommending a multilevel focus for health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111418634">Sallis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1090198111418634">Winett, 1995</xref>). Ecological models are now commonplace in public health discourse. Both the World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111418634">Blas &amp; Kurup, 2010</xref>) and <italic>Healthy People 2010</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1090198111418634">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000</xref>) conceptualize health as determined by an interplay of environments and individual factors, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urge many of their grantees to adopt a social ecological perspective in program design. Training in social ecological models is also increasingly emphasized; the Institute of Medicine and the Association of Schools of Public Health recommend that public health students be taught to use multilevel conceptual models to improve health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111418634">Gebbie, Rosenstock, &amp; Hernandez, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198111418634">Smedley, 2000</xref>). Within the health promotion field, ecological approaches have been used as foundations for planning and evaluation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111418634">Glasgow, Vogt, &amp; Boles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111418634">Green &amp; Kreuter, 1999</xref>) and to better understand determinants of behaviors such as smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111418634">Commit Research Group, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111418634">De Vries et al., 2003</xref>), physical activity and nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111418634">Brownson, Baker, Housemann, Brennan, &amp; Bacak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111418634">Egger &amp; Swinburn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111418634">Elder et al., 2007</xref>), and sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111418634">DiClemente, Salazar, &amp; Crosby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111418634">Latkin &amp; Knowlton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1090198111418634">Raneri &amp; Wiemann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198111418634">Salazar et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The extent to which these appeals for a more comprehensive approach to solving public health problems have been adopted in practice, however, is unclear. Research documenting the frequency of multilevel approaches within the health promotion field has been limited. In the few notable exceptions, assessments were limited to a relatively small number of interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111418634">Kok, Gottlieb, Commers, &amp; Smerecnik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1090198111418634">Richard, Potvin, Kishchuk, Prlic, &amp; Green, 1996</xref>) or focused on a specific health topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1090198111418634">Richard, Gauvin, Potvin, Denis, &amp; Kishchuk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1090198111418634">Richard, Gauvin, &amp; Raine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198111418634">Salazar et al., 2010</xref>). To enhance our understanding of whether interventions continue to primarily address intrapersonal and interpersonal factors, we used the intervention recommendations originally offered by McLeroy to develop a literature coding system to identify the ecological levels that health promotion programs target and then applied this system to intervention articles from the past 20 years of <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic> and its predecessor, <italic>Health Education Quarterly</italic>. Although the breadth of health promotion practice cannot be captured by examining one journal alone, articles describing health promotion strategies and interventions in <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic> showcase many of the promising and proven efforts of health educators across health topics. We aimed to identify which ecological levels received the most attention in these intervention efforts and determine the extent to which programs simultaneously target multiple levels of change. Our results may prove useful to practitioners and lay audiences advocating for inclusion of intervention targets previously underrepresented in public health work in future endeavors.</p>
<sec id="section1-1090198111418634" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The literature collected for this analysis was designed to capture <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic> articles that included in-depth descriptions of interventions, so that the targets and activities of those interventions could be analyzed using a social ecological model. We used the Medline database to identify all articles that included the search string “intervention” in any search field, including title and abstract, that were published online or in print in either <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic> or its predecessor, <italic>Health Education Quarterly</italic>, between January 1, 1989, and December 31, 2008.</p>
<p>The Medline search identified 236 articles. One author read abstracts of all articles, labeling each based on whether the reader believed an intervention was described in the article. All articles were labeled <italic>include, eliminate</italic>, or <italic>read full article to determine inclusion</italic>. For articles in the final category, the reader examined the complete article text to determine whether an intervention description was included. Abstracts and articles were usually marked for elimination because they reviewed a particular intervention technique without describing a specific program or described data gathered about a potential target population that had not yet been used to design an intervention. A second reader reviewed the abstracts and articles tagged for elimination; if this reader concurred with the removal recommendation of the first reader, the articles were eliminated from the collection. This process resulted in the removal of 79 articles. The remaining 157 articles were subjected to the review using the social ecological model assessment tool designed for this purpose (available on request).</p>
<p>We developed a coding system designed to capture identified intervention activities, targets for change, behavioral health topics, program settings, and theoretical bases for the interventions described in each article. The coding system was applied by two readers to three articles from different journal years as a pilot test and revised to clarify codes. Two readers then independently applied the coding system to all 157 articles in the collection. The two readers agreed on whether an article included activities or measures from a specific ecological level between 61% and 96% of the time, depending on the level. Kappa scores measuring interrater reliability for different sections of the coding system ranged from .12 to .69. One limitation of kappa scores, however, is that they are often poor measures of concurrence when an event, such as assignment of an intervention to a particular ecological level, is either rare or very prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198111418634">Viera &amp; Garrett, 2005</xref>), as was often the case in these data. To resolve interrater disagreements, interventions were categorized at particular ecological levels if either rater coded them as such.</p>
<p>To determine the number and types of social ecological levels articulated in the intervention literature, certain categories in the assessment tool were collapsed, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111418634">Table 1</xref>. Level-specific groupings were determined in conjunction with the five-level model outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111418634">McLeroy et al. (1988)</xref>; additional levels suggested in later work, such as physical environments and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198111418634">McLeroy, Norton, Kegler, Burdine, &amp; Sumaya, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198111418634">Stokols, Pelletier, &amp; Fielding, 1996</xref>), were incorporated into the community-level group. Social ecological model analysis was conducted along two dimensions: activities and targets for change. Activities were grouped according to the individuals who received education, training, or skills enhancement or according to the level of environmental modification made. For example, education, training, and skills enhancement of institution members beyond the intervention target audience as well as efforts to modify institutional environments, policies or services were analyzed as institutional-level activities. The intervention activities dimension was coded for all articles in the analysis.</p>

<p>Intervention targets were identified based on the type of health behavior determinant identified and/or measured in the article as a mechanism for change. For example, interventions that targeted or measured knowledge, perceptions, intentions, or self-efficacy of the target population were coded at the intrapersonal level, whereas community-level targets and measures included improvement to community services, environments, or capacities. Some articles described or measured changes only in health or health behaviors but not determinants of these outcomes. Our coding system was designed to assign behavioral determinants of social ecological levels; where this did not occur, articles were coded as not describing targets at any social ecological level (<italic>n</italic> = 26).</p>
<p>Codes were entered into an Access database and then converted for use with conventional statistical software for analysis. In addition to descriptive statistics, we conducted a series of Pearson chi-square tests to identify differences in intervention activity and target levels by behavioral health topic, intervention setting, and theoretical basis. Time trends were assessed over 1-, 5- and 10-year increments using chi-square tests and logistic regression.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 157 articles reviewed here described 132 unique interventions, addressing 21 behaviors, in eight different settings. Primary among these were nutrition initiatives, found in more than one third of all articles, and physical activity programs, described in more than one quarter. School and communities were the most common intervention setting, each included in more than one third of all articles reviewed. Two thirds of the articles described results of impact or outcome evaluation, and more than one third included process evaluation information. Although the majority of articles referred to specific theories used in developing the interventions they described, one third reported on interventions that had no stated theoretical underpinning. Social cognitive theory was the most prevalent theory undergirding the interventions, followed by social support and the transtheoretical model/stages of change framework. Fewer than 10% of all articles identified the social ecological model as an intervention basis.</p>
<p>Regardless of topic, setting, theory use, or time period, articles were more likely to describe intervention activities and targets for change for the lower levels of the social ecological model proposed by McLeroy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111418634">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111418634">Figure 1</xref>). Whereas 95% of all articles described individual-level activities and 67% described interpersonal activities, only a little more than a third (39%) described institutional-level activities. Community- and policy-level activities, by contrast, were much less common, found only in 20% and 6% of articles, respectively. Similar patterns emerged for stated targets. Furthermore, almost two thirds of all articles (63%) described interventions that focused on only one or two social ecological levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111418634">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Analysis of articles by behavioral topic, intervention setting, and theoretical underpinning revealed some distinctions in the types and number of social ecological levels employed by the intervention. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111418634">Table 2</xref> describes the results of descriptive and bivariate analysis of intervention activities; results for analyses of intervention targets were similar. Nearly 60% of the articles that addressed nutrition and a little fewer than half of the physical activity or smoking articles included institutional-level activities; for all other topics the percentage that included institutional activities was at or less than 33%. Bivariate analysis suggests that rates of institutional activities were significantly higher for nutrition interventions and significantly lower for sexual behavior and disease screening, when compared with all other topics. Nutrition, physical activity, and smoking interventions were also most likely to be multilevel in nature; between one third and one half of the articles in each of these topic areas included activities at three or more levels, although only nutrition was significantly different from the other topics in the chi-square test.</p>

<p>Additionally, interventions in certain settings had higher prevalence rates for particular social ecological intervention levels. For example, more than half of the interventions set in schools or workplaces included institutional-level activities, as compared with only 22% of health care–based interventions and 26% of community-based interventions. Family-based interventions included interpersonal level activities at rates higher than other settings (93%), and community-based interventions were most likely to include community-level (44%) and policy-level (15%) activities. Furthermore, a statistically significant proportion of school-based (52%) and sizable proportions of family- (48%) and community-based (40%) intervention articles included activities on three or more levels.</p>
<p>Articles that used a specific theoretical perspective were no more likely to describe intervention activities at the upper social ecological levels, or at three or more levels, than articles lacking a theoretical orientation. Distinctions are more evident, however, in the small group of articles that specifically referenced a social ecological model as foundational to the intervention. Although articles might use a social ecological approach without naming it as such, our analyses revealed that multilevel interventions were significantly more prevalent in articles that used social ecological language explicitly. More than two thirds (71%) of these articles described institutional-level intervention activities, nearly half (43%) included community-level intervention activities, and one fifth (21%) noted activities on the policy level as compared with 37%, 19%, and 7%, respectively, of articles using any theoretical approach and 44%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, of articles without theoretical basis. Furthermore, more than two thirds of the articles specifying a social ecological approach described intervention activities at more than three social ecological levels compared with just more than one third of the theoretical or nontheoretical articles in general.</p>
<p>A comparison of the first and second decade of reviewed articles suggests some increases in institutional and multilevel interventions. Bivariate analyses of potential time trends, however, demonstrated no statistically significant differences in specific intervention ecologic levels or likelihood of multilevel intervention between the two decades. Results remained nonsignificant when 1-year and 5-year increments were analyzed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intervention literature analyzed here suggests that the calls for multilevel interventions that better incorporate social, institutional, and policy approaches to health promotion have gone largely unheeded. Despite this journal’s introduction, more than 20 years ago, of a model recognizing health as influenced by intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy factors, nearly two thirds of the reviewed articles described intervention activities and targets at only one or two of these levels. Expecting any single intervention to focus on three or more ecological levels may be unrealistic, however, given the limited scope and resources with which most interventions are endowed. Furthermore, social ecology may be most useful as a tool to help us understand health behavior as determined by a set of interconnected individual and contextual factors, rather than a prescription for intervention (K. McLeroy, personal communication, April 27, 2011). A full assessment of a health issue within a situationally specific population might reveal a single intervention leverage point as the most effective and feasible way to create change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198111418634">Meadows, 2008</xref>). This observation suggests that even single-level interventions are not necessarily inconsistent with a social ecological approach.</p>
<p>Yet our analysis identified not only a high prevalence of single- or dual-level interventions but also continued emphasis on specific levels of the social ecological model. Interventions remain focused on individual beliefs and intentions and on the attitudes and actions of social networks as levers for change. Although institutional and community approaches do make limited appearances in the literature reviewed here, interventions that target public policies remain essentially absent. It seems unlikely that health promotion planning processes that are based in a social ecological understanding of a problem would consistently deem institutions, communities, and policies as inefficient leverage points for change across all health topics in all intervention settings.</p>
<p>The articles subject to analysis here necessarily represent only a small fraction of the body of health promotion work underway. Our search strategy may not have generated a complete list of all articles describing interventions in <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic> in the relevant time period because of limitations of the Medline search system. Furthermore, articles in one journal are only a subset of all health promotion work and may reflect editorial preferences for intervention type rather than accurately sampling work in the field. Additionally, many health promotion interventions are summarized in other public health journals, and other excellent public health practice is not depicted in the academic journals at all. Finally, the data for this research are based on what was described about an intervention in an article, not observation of the actual intervention itself. To accommodate the style and length of a journal submission, authors and editors may have limited their incorporation of certain intervention details that could have resulted in different coding had they been included.</p>
<p>Although the results here do not summarize the entirety of the field, they may still reflect general patterns in current health promotion efforts. The interventions analyzed do cover a wide range of health topics and intervention settings and include both large, well-funded efforts and smaller, local projects. Moreover, <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic> is one of the leading health promotion journals, especially for practitioners who may rely on a few select journals to detail innovations in, and models of, health behavior interventions. As such, it serves as a key mechanism for disseminating ideas and thus may strongly influence current and future trends. The review time period included several issues dedicated entirely to a few national, multilevel projects, such as the <italic>Coordinated Approach to Child Health</italic> (CATCH) initiative. Additionally, our coding strategy provided relatively liberal assessments of ecological efforts, since only one reader was required to identify an intervention level to result in its inclusion. The significant presence of large, multilevel projects and our use of an inclusive coding strategy suggest our estimates of upper and multilevel projects are, if anything, likely to be inflated compared with the field as a whole.</p>
<p>The primary conclusion of this analysis—that health educators need to extend our efforts to better address structural levels of social ecological influence on behavior in order to have a more enduring health impact—has been echoed elsewhere in the literature. Numerous articles have recently issued calls for increased focus on the contextual and social determinants of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111418634">Koh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111418634">Marmot, Friel, Bell, Houweling, &amp; Taylor, 2008</xref>) or offered new definitions and tools to assist public health practitioners in these efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111418634">Brownson, Chriqui, &amp; Stamatakis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111418634">Frieden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111418634">Brownson, Seiler, &amp; Eyler, 2010</xref>). Empirically, the results presented here are consistent with recent reviews that document limited numbers of policy-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111418634">Eyler &amp; Dreisinger, 2011</xref>), environmentally focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198111418634">Salazar et al., 2010</xref>), systems-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1090198111418634">Ryerson Espino &amp; Trickett, 2008</xref>), and multilevel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111418634">Kok et al., 2008</xref>) articles within the public health literature. Our results, however, differ in its conclusion from one of the most recent articles to examine published research; that article demonstrates an increasing ecological trend in the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1090198111418634">Richard et al., 2011</xref>). The latter analysis, however, was limited to physical activity and nutrition-based literature; our results suggest that ecological success stories may be most prevalent in these topic areas, with limited improvement for other topics.</p>
<p>Although subgroup analyses of the data presented here highlight differential progress by health behavior and setting, these results may also provide guidance for meeting both the long-standing recommendation to approach health from a social ecological perspective and the current calls for more policy and contextual efforts. Interventions addressing certain health topics or in specific settings have more established traditions of implementing and publishing the results of multi- and upper level approaches. For example, many of the school-based interventions described in the literature targeted not only students but also teachers, staff, administrators, and the school environment. Similarly, nearly half of the community-based interventions were designed to consider communities as both settings to access individuals and modifiable structures that affect health. Nutrition, physical activity, and smoking interventions were more likely than interventions addressing other topics to adopt a social ecological approach that focused change at multiple levels beyond the individual target population. Practitioners may benefit from applying more broadly intervention structures designed for these settings and topics. Fortunately, school and community settings, and nutrition, physical activity, and smoking interventions, were also the most prevalent settings and topics in the literature reviewed. Examples of interventions that fulfill the social ecological recommendations of the field, therefore, are available as models for health promotion practitioners, even if they remain limited in number.</p>
<p>As with health behavior change, modification of health promotion efforts may be influenced by a wide range of practical and conceptual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111418634">Sallis et al., 2008</xref>). Limited resources may preclude the development of programs that target multiple levels of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111418634">Stokols, 1996</xref>), requiring practitioners to prioritize some intervention strategies over others. Planning models suggest selecting interventions based on evidence, health behavior theory, and community input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111418634">Butterfoss, Goodman, &amp; Wandersman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111418634">Green &amp; Kreuter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111418634">Kreuter, 1992</xref>). Intrapersonal and interpersonal strategies, such as tailored health communication, lay health advisor programs, and motivational interviewing, have long histories in health promotion practice. For practitioners looking for best practices, the public health and medical literature provides review articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111418634">Dunn, Deroo, &amp; Rivara, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111418634">Eng, Parker, &amp; Harlan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111418634">Kreuter &amp; Wray, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198111418634">Rhodes, Foley, Zometa, &amp; Bloom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1090198111418634">Rubak, Sandbæk, Lauritzen, &amp; Christensen, 2005</xref>) describing the strengths, challenges, and lessons learned from implementing these strategies in multiple settings. Additionally, these types of programs are grounded in theories that have matured and gained widespread acceptance in the past two decades, such as the health belief model, the theory of planned behavior, and social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198111418634">Rimer, 2008</xref>). Each of these theories is rooted in utility concepts from psychology and focuses on changing individual motivations to stimulate behavior change. Constructs often included in these theories, such as self-efficacy and subjective norms, are usually clearly defined, with validated measurement scales that facilitate both assessment of target audiences and evaluation of intervention results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111418634">Ajzen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111418634">Anderson, Funnell, Fitzgerald, &amp; Marrero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111418634">Lorig, Chastain, Ung, Shoor, &amp; Holman, 1989</xref>). Although our review found theory-grounded work twice as prevalent as indicated by a previous review of several public health journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198111418634">Painter, 2008</xref>), the predominant theories in the literature we reviewed continue to have an individual orientation.</p>
<p>Although interventions targeting upper levels of the social ecological model, such as empowerment education, media advocacy, and policy change, have resulted in a number of public health successes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111418634">Clark et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198111418634">Minkler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198111418634">Wakefield et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1090198111418634">Wallack, Dorfman, Jernigan, &amp; Themba-Nixon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198111418634">Wallerstein, 1992</xref>), replicating these approaches is likely more challenging than adapting intrapersonal- and interpersonal-level programs. On a practical level, many public health professionals working in government or nonprofit agencies face strict limits on their engagement in specific activities common to upper level interventions, such as policy advocacy. Even if some of these barriers were removed, however, health educators may not have the training or resources to successfully plan and implement institutional-, community-, or policy-level programs. Commonly used theories and frameworks that guide higher level social and behavioral change, such as diffusion theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198111418634">Rogers, 2003</xref>) or grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1090198111418634">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>), focus more on the process of creating change rather than specific outcomes. In some cases, researchers and practitioners describe the influence of social inequities on health using grand theories that provide overall explanations of human interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111418634">Cockerham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111418634">Lynch &amp; Kaplan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198111418634">Szreter &amp; Woolcock, 2004</xref>). Although appropriation of sociological perspectives to undergird interventions at upper ecological levels makes sense, practitioners may be unfamiliar with these perspectives unless they are regularly included in public health training programs. Even if taught, however, these grand theories do not usually include the types of operationalized constructs that characterize psychological theories. Despite recent efforts to recommend potential metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111418634">Lantz &amp; Pritchard, 2010</xref>), validated methods for measuring changes at the upper social ecological levels remain limited or poorly adopted. For example, several researchers have developed scales to measure community capacity and competence, but with the exception of several notable studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111418634">Eng &amp; Parker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111418634">Goodman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111418634">Lochner, Kawachi, &amp; Kennedy, 1999</xref>), application of these constructs for program evaluation in the public health literature is rare. For practitioners who are accountable to private or taxpayer-supported funding sources, well-defined intrapersonal and interpersonal interventions with easily measurable objectives may hold more appeal.</p>
<p>As with any multifaceted problem, a multipronged approach is likely required to change our current intervention approaches. Within the constraints of their resources, and guided by the literature that does exist, practitioners should aim to enhance their current interventions, even in small steps. Designing and distributing materials to the social networks of target audiences, building new community partnerships, and advocating for environmental changes could be feasible initiatives that would ultimately result in stronger public health promotion. Researchers should continue to develop and test the tools necessary to implement multilevel interventions, including theories about the role of social networks, institutions, communities, and policies in determining health, and practical mechanisms for measuring the constructs of those theories. As others have recently recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111418634">Allegrante et al., 2009</xref>), public health training programs should work to ensure that such tools become integrated into teaching curricula, alongside more established theories and intervention strategies. Furthermore, even as changes in the theoretical, empirical, and training structures are implemented, health educators may need to increasingly rely on multidisciplinary teams to provide the breadth of knowledge and experience required to facilitate effective health behavior change. Finally, as improvements are made in both research and practice, dissemination of multilevel interventions, through professional societies, peer-reviewed journals, and public health networks, is critical.</p>

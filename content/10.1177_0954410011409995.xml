<abstract>
<p>In this article, a hybrid electric propulsion system which consists of a fuel cell (FC) and a battery is proposed for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) propulsion application. Based on the UAV propulsion power requirements during take-off, climb, endurance, and maximum velocity, the hybrid electric power plant specifications are defined to respond to any propulsion power demand. A power and energy management system is introduced to control the hybrid system power flow while optimizing the FC system performances. The power and energy management system consists of three sections called, power management system, power electronic interface, and energy management system. The power management system decides the operating power of the each power source based on the propulsion power demand and the battery state of charge. The power electronic interface is an implementation protocol of the power management decisions through a unidirectional power converter and a bidirectional power converter which are connected to the FC, the battery, and the DC bus. Based on the FC current decided by the power management system, the energy management system controls the air supply system of the FC to maximize the FC system net power output. A referenced model is used to obtain the optimum inlet air pressure of the FC and a neuro-fuzzy-based adaptive control architecture adapts the FC air compressor power to the optimum value. The results show that the optimum compressor power configuration is superior than the constant power configuration.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011409995"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Long endurance electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerged in modern aerospace industry due to the recent technological advances in electric propulsion and modern mission requirement. The electric propulsion directly converts the chemical energy into mechanical power without internal or external combustion. The proposed hybrid electric UAV propulsion system mainly consisted of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), a Li-Ion battery and a permanent magnet brushless (PMBL) DC motor and power converters. The FC/ battery hybrid configuration shows a potential to replace conventional combustion engines from the UAV due to the high power and energy densities of the hybrid system. The PMBL DC motor has advantages such as high efficiency, high speed range, reduced acoustic operation and improved speed <italic>versus</italic> torque characteristics [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011409995">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011409995">2</xref></bold>]. In addition, the PEM FC and the Li-Ion battery hybrid power plant has higher energy conversion efficiency than the similar size combustion engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011409995">3</xref>]. The PEM FC powered UAV's endurance capability has improved considerably due to the high energy density of the power plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011409995">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011409995">5</xref>]. In addition to that, the electric propulsion is considered as an environment friendly propulsion concept due to its stealth operation and minimum carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The propeller driven piston engine aircraft efficiency is low at the high-speed operation and much noisier than the low speed operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011409995">6</xref>]. The wax deposit inside the fuel storage at low temperature is an another drawback of the piston engine driven aircraft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011409995">6</xref>]. Therefore, the propeller driven aircrafts were developed with low r/min piston engines with variable pitch propellers. In the electric powered aircrafts, the high speed PMBL DC motors can operate at higher efficiencies than the piston engines and hence eliminate the requirement of the low-speed propeller operation.</p>
<p>In the hybrid electric propulsion, the power management system controls the power flow between the propulsion system and the power plant. The FC system is combined with the Li-Ion battery as the secondary power source to supply the additional power required for take-off and climb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011409995">2</xref>]. In addition to that, the secondary power source eliminates the FC stack transient delay caused by the chemical reaction. The importance of the FC system power management with the secondary power source has been described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011409995">7</xref>] and outlined the requirement of the advanced control architecture for hybrid power sharing.</p>
<p>The proposed power and energy management system is a control architecture which has three sections called, energy management system, power management system, and power electronic interface. The energy management system optimizes the energy usage of the PEM FC system. The power management system decides the operating power mode of the propulsion system and develops the logical sequences for the power electronic interface to switch the current flow direction of the power plant. The power electronic interface is the implementation protocol of the power management system decisions through a bidirectional and a unidirectional power converters according to the propulsion power demand.</p>
<p>The proposed power and energy management architecture will be discussed in following sections. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0954410011409995">Section 2</xref>, the UAV propulsion power requirements during the different flying conditions are derived. The hybrid electric propulsion is discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0954410011409995">Section 3</xref>. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-0954410011409995">Section 4</xref>, a power and energy management system is introduced to control the hybrid system power flow. An adaptive control architecture for the energy management system is discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0954410011409995">Section 5</xref>. The hybrid power plant specifications are defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-0954410011409995">Section 6</xref>.

<sec id="sec2-0954410011409995"><title>2 UAV PROPULSION POWER REQUIREMENT</title>
<p>The propulsion power requirement during the mission is depended on the flying modes of the aircraft such as aircraft take-off, climb, cruising, endurance, descent, and landing. Initially, the aircraft critical parameters are analysed for a specific intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. Then, the propulsion power required for the aircraft take-off, the climb, the endurance, and the maximum velocity modes is obtained. The hybrid UAV performance specifications described in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011409995">8</xref>] are considered for the FC UAV propulsion analysis. The proposed aircraft performance requirements are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011409995">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The HEUAV's components such as an IC engine, a clutch, a fuel tank are replaced by the PEMFC system, a controller, power converters and a hydrogen gas cylinder. It has assumed that the glider which was used in the HEUAV is fitted with the proposed FC-UAV. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011409995">Table 2</xref> shows that the FC-UAV mass has increased by approximately 4.2 kg than the HEUAV.

The FC-UAV total weight is obtained as 174.6 N. The authors assume that the FC system and the hydrogen fuel storage can be installed into the HEUAV airframe without major modifications.

<p>A regulated hybrid power architecture which consists of a PEMFC system, a Li-Ion battery, a DC/DC boost converter, a DC/DC bidirectional converter and a PMBL DC motor with a three-phase inverter is proposed for the FC-UAV. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011409995">Figure 1</xref> shows the schematic diagram of the hybrid power plant. The compressed hydrogen cylinder supplies the required hydrogen gas to the PEM FC system and a hydrogen regulator controls hydrogen pressure and flow rate. The FC system air compressor pressurizes the inlet manifold air supply. The hydrogen and the oxygen gases are reacted at the electrodes and produce electricity, water, and heat. The unidirectional power converter (UDC) boosts the PEMFC voltage output and regulates the DC bus voltage. The bidirectional converter (BDC) boosts the battery voltage during the high power state and operates as a buck converter during the low power state of the propulsion system. The three-phase inverter converts the DC supply into the three-phase signals. The PMBL DC motor speed is controlled by varying the duty ratios of the inverter signals based on the sensor feedback.

<sec id="sec10-0954410011409995"><title>4 POWER AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT</title>
<p>The power and energy management is a process which addresses power flow and energy usage for each power source. The power and energy management system (PEMS) is sectioned into three subsystems called, energy management system (EMS), power management system (PMS), and power electronic interface (PEI). The energy management system formulates the strategies to optimize the energy usage of the PEMFC. The PMS decides the amount of power shared with each power source by controlling the unidirectional and the bidirectional power converters. The PEI regulates the power converters currents and voltages according to the pulse width modulations (PWM) signals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011409995">Figure 2</xref> shows the flow diagram of the power and energy management system.

</p>
<p>In the power and energy management architecture, the hybrid power plant operating power is divided into three states called, start-up, charging, and the high power. The power management system decides the operating power state based on the battery terminal voltage and the DC bus current. In each power state, the current flow is controlled by the UDC and the BDC power converters. As the second stage of the control architecture, the PEMFC air supply system is controlled based on the FC current determined by the power management system. The referenced model obtains the optimum compressor power and adapts the actual system to the optimum state.</p>
<sec id="sec11-0954410011409995"><title>4.1 Power management system</title>
<p>The power management system consists of a power sharing algorithm which decides the operating power state of the hybrid system. The power management system is developed as a state machine and the states are transited based on the DC bus current and the battery terminal voltage. The power management algorithm is shown in flowchart (Fig. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954410011409995">3</xref>). The Start-up process of the power plant is activated at the initial stage of the propulsion and later the operating state is varied between the high power and the charging states. The Start-up state prevents the FC system transient delay and allows the battery to supply the propulsion power. If the battery power is not sufficient, an external power supply is required to power the FC balance of plant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011409995">Figure 4</xref> shows the current flow during the start-up state of the PMS.
<fig id="fig4-0954410011409995" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Hybrid system current flow during the start-up state</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011409995-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The start-up condition remains until the FC system generates the electricity. When the FC system is gradually increased to the rated power level, the PMS switches the BDC into the buck mode and starts the initial charging before the aircraft takeoff. The FC system supplies the propulsion power and charges the battery until the battery terminal voltage (Bat vol) &gt; 12 <italic>V</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011409995">Figure 5</xref> shows the current flow direction of the propulsion system during the battery charging state.

<p>After the battery is fully charged, the BDC is switched back the boost mode and increases the propeller motor speed for the aircraft takeoff. Then, the high power state is activated and remains until the aircraft has achieved desired altitude or velocity. At this stage, the BDC and the UDC are operated in the boost mode. The power flow during the high power state is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011409995">Fig. 6</xref>.

<sec id="sec12-0954410011409995"><title>4.2 Power electronic interface</title>
<p>The power electronic interface consisted with an unidirectional boost converter for the PEMFC system and a bidirectional converter for the Li-Ion battery. Non-isolated PWM-controlled DC/DC power converters are developed to regulate the power flow of the hybrid system. The UDC and the BDC are operated in voltage control mode or current control mode depending on the DC bus current. When the DC bus current is lower than the propulsion system rated value, the UDC is operated in the voltage control mode and the BDC is operated in the current control mode. If the DC bus current is higher than the rated value, the UDC is operated in the current control mode and the BDC is switched to the voltage control mode. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954410011409995">Table 4</xref> shows the control modes of the UDC and the BDC at the high power and the charging power states. The amount of load current distributed between the PEMFC and the battery is changed by varying the PWM signals duty ratios. The voltage and the current compensators generate the errors between the referenced values of the DC bus voltage/current and the actual values. Based on the current or the voltage error, the PWM signal duty ratio is determined. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011409995">Figure 7</xref> shows the schematic diagram of the voltage and the current regulation processes at the DC bus.

<p>The energy management system is developed to optimize the energy usage of the FC system.

The optimum compressor power can be represented as the optimum compressor motor voltage by considering the relationship of the compressor and the compressor motor characteristics. The compressor map is used to determine the optimum air flowrates for the different pressure ratios. In order to generate the optimum pressure ratio and the flowrate, the compressor motor speed is changed according to the FC current variations. The required optimum air flowrate and the optimum pressure can be achieved by varying the terminal voltage of the compressor motor. However, investigating the compressor characteristics and the compressor motor control methods deviate from the scope of this article. Therefore, the compressor power is considered for the control architecture analysis.

<sec id="sec14-0954410011409995"><title>5.1 Adaptive control strategy</title>
<p>The FC air supply system should maintain the optimum compressor power to maximize the FC system net power output during the mission. In the literature, the control approaches such as PI controllers, fuzzy logic, neural networks, optimal control, adaptive control, and genetic algorithm were mostly used as the FC control methodologies. However, in dynamic systems, the applicability of the control methodology is bounded by the limitations on gain, overshoot, and time response. An advanced control architecture with online learning and training algorithms gives considerable benefits in terms of the controllability of the non-linear system. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) can learn from the feedbacks and trains the system output to achieve the referenced value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011409995">13</xref>]. The main advantages of the ANFIS based control architecture are the dynamic adaptability to the non-linear system and ability to define the approximated initial conditions for the training process from the fuzzy logic rule based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011409995">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In the FC control architecture, the optimum compressor power which is described in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-0954410011409995">9</xref>) is implemented as the referenced model to the ANFIS controller which adapts the actual compressor power to the optimum value in each time step. The schematic diagram of the adaptive controller is shown in (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula10-0954410011409995">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Figure shows that the input parameters <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>fc</italic></sub> and <italic>SoC</italic> are trained to produce the optimum compressor power in the ANFIS controller and the control signal is sent to the actual plant. Initially, the controller operates as a fuzzy logic controller and after several time steps (10 s for this analysis), it operates as the ANFIS controller. After identifying the initial conditions of the compressor optimum power, the ANFIS controller starts the online training process. The layered fuzzification structure which is developed with the neural network feedback loops trains the fuzzy output using the back-propagation algorithm and the error minimization algorithm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011409995">Figure 11</xref> shows the network representation of the ANFIS controller.

<sec id="sec22-0954410011409995"><title>7 SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS</title>
<p>The hybrid propulsion system was modelled in Matlab Simpower system tool box and the ANFIS control architecture was developed in Simulink. The DC bus current profile which is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0954410011409995">Table 6</xref> was simulated to verify the robustness of the proposed control architecture. Initially, the performances of the power management system was investigated. Later, the FC current profile obtained from the power management was used to verify the energy management performances. The EMS performances were compared with a optimum compressor power and a constant compressor power.</p>
<p>The PMBL motor was loaded with a mechanical torque in order to generate the required DC bus current profile. The DC bus current profile which is obtained from the simulations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011409995">Fig. 17</xref>.

<p>The start-up state was limited to the 100 s and then, the high power state was activated for 60 s time period. The charging power state remained 6 min and 20 s. Again, the high power state applied for 1 min period when the aircraft flew at the maximum velocity. The aircraft lowering and the landing period last long for 1 min.</p>
<p>The load current distribution between the UDC and BDC are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011409995">Figs. 18</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954410011409995">19</xref>. During the startup state, the UDC current is gradually increased after 40 s. After the 40 s, the BDC current flow gradually declines. At 100 s, the UDC current was 2 <italic>A</italic> and the BDC current was 4 <italic>A</italic>. Then, the PMS activated the high power state and at the same time, the PEI changed the UDC operating mode into the current control mode. The UDC current was regulated to the maximum 9.2 <italic>A</italic> and the FC system was operated at the rated current 23.5 <italic>A</italic>. During the high power state, the BDC was operated in the voltage control mode and supplied 12.5 <italic>A</italic> current. When the charging state activated, the UDC was switched into the voltage control mode and the BDC was in the buck mode and regulated the current for the battery charging.

The battery SoC variations during the mission is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-0954410011409995">Fig. 22</xref>.

<p>Based on the FC current which was decided by the power management system, the energy management system optimized the compressor motor power usage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-0954410011409995">Figure 23</xref> shows the optimized compressor power obtained from the referenced model of the ANFIS controller. When the FC current was high, the compressor power was increased to supply the excess air to the FC system. The charging state consumed less compressor power than the high power state. The compressor power was increased to 10.3 W during the high power state.

<p>The FC system net power outputs with the optimized compressor power and the constant 10 W compressor power were compared. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-0954410011409995">Figure 24</xref> shows the net power output of the FC system with optimized compressor power. The difference between the FC system net power and the FC stack power was high during the high power state and the power deviation reduced during the charging power state. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25-0954410011409995">Figure 25</xref> shows that the FC system net power output with the constant compressor power. The compressor operating at the constant power consumed more FC stack power than the actual required compressor power during the charging state. Hence, the constant compressor power configuration loss was higher than the optimized compressor power loss, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-0954410011409995">Fig. 26</xref>. By considering the net power differences at charging state, 2.6 per cent energy saved in the optimized compressor power mode.

<sec id="sec23-0954410011409995"><title>8 CONCLUSION</title>
<p>In this article, a power and energy management system is proposed for the FC UAV propulsion application. The propulsion power required for the different flying modes such as take-off, climb, endurance, and maximum velocity are defined. The hybrid system operating power is categorized into the three sections called, the start-up state, the charging state, and the high power state. The power management system implements the state sequences based on the feedbacks received from the battery terminal voltage and the DC bus current. The power electronic interface generates the required PWM signals duty ratios in order to control the unidirectional and the bidirectional power converters. The power converters are controlled in the voltage control mode or current control mode depending on the operating power state.</p>
<p>The energy management system is introduced to optimize the FC system energy usage. Based on the FC electrical current which is controlled by the power management system, the FC system inlet air supply system is also controlled. The FC compressor optimum pressure ratio which generates the maximum net power output from the FC system is obtained as a function of the FC current. Then, the optimum compressor power is used as the referenced model for the adaptive neuro-fuzzy controller to adapt the actual compressor power to the optimum value. The FC system net power output is compared with the optimum compressor power and with the constant compressor power and identified 2.6 per cent energy saving in the optimum compressor configuration.</p>
<p>The proposed power and energy management system dynamically controls the hybrid system power flow according to the propulsion power demand. At the same time, the FC controller optimizes the FC system energy utilization and hence consequently extends the UAV endurance capability.</p></sec>

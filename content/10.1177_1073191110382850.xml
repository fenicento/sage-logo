<abstract>
<p>This study examined the psychometric equivalence of paper-and-pencil and Internet formats of key questionnaires used in couple research. Self-report questionnaires assessing interpersonal constructs (relationship satisfaction, communication/conflict management, partner support, emotional intimacy) and intrapersonal constructs (individual traits, psychological symptoms, contextual influences) were administered to young adults in committed dating relationships. The same measures were administered twice via paper-and-pencil and/or Internet methods over a 2-week period. Method order was counterbalanced among participants, and temporal stability was controlled. Intrapersonal and interpersonal measures generally remained reliable when administered online and demonstrated quantitative and qualitative equivalence across methods. The implications of online administration of questionnaires are discussed, and specific recommendations are made for researchers who wish to transition to online data collection.</p>

<p>Self-report questionnaires are perhaps the most common research tool used in the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191110382850">Fife-Schaw, 2006</xref>). Traditionally administered as paper-and-pencil instruments, over the past decade, questionnaires have been increasingly administered via the Internet by researchers desiring a more efficient and less expensive method of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191110382850">Birnbaum, 2004</xref>). Although Internet administration has numerous advantages, there are certain differences between written and Internet formats (e.g., participant anonymity, control over research environment, differences in visual presentation of items) that may have consequences for the integrity of data collected online. Specifically, questionnaires originally developed as paper assessments may be less reliable and/or valid when administered via the Internet. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine the psychometric equivalence of questionnaires across written and Internet formats before widely implementing Internet administration of a particular questionnaire. Whereas examinations of equivalence have been conducted for measures of personality, individual psychopathology, and physical health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191110382850">Carlbring et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191110382850">Coles, Cook, &amp; Blake, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191110382850">Davis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191110382850">Hewson &amp; Charlton, 2005</xref>), they have yet to be conducted for measures of relationship constructs (e.g., relationship satisfaction, conflict, support). Nevertheless, Internet administration of traditional couple measures is becoming increasingly commonplace. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the psychometric equivalence of questionnaires commonly used in <italic>couple research</italic> in order to inform researchers considering a transition from paper-and-pencil to Internet data collection. By examining both intrapersonal and interpersonal measures of key constructs widely used in couple research, we sought to make specific recommendations regarding the use of Internet versions of questionnaires.</p>

<title>Advantages of Administering Paper-and-Pencil Questionnaires Over the Internet</title>
<p>The shift to Internet administration of questionnaires has been driven by the numerous advantages inherent in online data collection. For example, Internet administration is less time-consuming for the researcher compared with paper-and-pencil administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191110382850">Coles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073191110382850">Naglieri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191110382850">Schmidt, 1997</xref>). Researchers can eliminate time spent (a) preparing paper copies of questionnaires, (b) setting up laboratory appointments for questionnaire administration and/or mailing questionnaire packets, and (c) entering data into the computer. Furthermore, online data collection is far less expensive than data collection in written form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191110382850">Buchanan &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191110382850">Coles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191110382850">Hertel, Naumann, Konradt, &amp; Batinic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191110382850">Luce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191110382850">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073191110382850">Naglieri et al., 2004</xref>). Researchers can eliminate costs associated with copying paper surveys and mailing questionnaires and can reduce personnel costs associated with preparing materials, running laboratory appointments, and entering data.</p>
<p>Internet administration of questionnaires also has numerous sampling and methodological advantages. First, more accurate scoring of questionnaires is possible through Internet data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191110382850">Buchanan &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191110382850">Coles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191110382850">Luce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191110382850">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073191110382850">Naglieri et al., 2004</xref>). Errors resulting from transferring data from paper to computer are eliminated because data are directly entered into a computer program by the participant rather than by a third party (i.e., research assistant). Second, research participants view Internet administration as more convenient than paper-and-pencil administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191110382850">Luce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191110382850">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073191110382850">Naglieri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191110382850">Pettit, 1999</xref>). Internet administration allows participants to complete questionnaires at any time, day or night. It also reduces the amount of time that participants need to invest (e.g., eliminating time spent traveling to and from the laboratory), which also reduces the amount of compensation required. Because of these advantages, researchers are likely to improve response rates (e.g., the proportion of individuals who agree to enroll in a study after receiving an invitation) and participation rates (e.g., the proportion of individuals who complete questionnaires after being enrolled in a study). Furthermore, completing online surveys at their own convenience may also enhance participants’ motivation to respond to questions more carefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073191110382850">Riva, Teruzzi, &amp; Anolli, 2003</xref>). Third, collecting data via the Internet allows researchers to access larger, more representative, and more diverse samples, thus enhancing the external validity of collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191110382850">Coles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191110382850">Luce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073191110382850">Riva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191110382850">Schmidt, 1997</xref>). Specifically, individuals who are unable or unwilling to attend laboratory appointments can still participate if they have access to a computer at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>). This advantage has important implications for retention of participants in longitudinal research given that participants may relocate throughout the course of a study, making laboratory visits inconvenient and costly.</p>

<title>Potential Problems With Administering Paper-and-Pencil Questionnaires Over the Internet</title>
<p>Despite the advantages of Internet administration, there are two key differences between paper-and-paper and Internet methods of data collection that may have consequences for data integrity. First, the format of data collection differs—on a computer screen versus on paper. In this case, the primary threat to data integrity results from differences in the visual presentation of items. Second, the primary reason why researchers have transitioned to Internet data collection is because participants can complete questionnaires outside of the laboratory (e.g., at home). Consequently, the difference in method of administration is almost always confounded with differences in environmental factors (e.g., distractions, privacy) and clinical factors (e.g., rapport with the researcher, degree of anonymity). We now turn to a discussion of each of these seminal issues.</p>
<sec id="section3-1073191110382850">
<title>Differences in Method of Administration: Issues Regarding Visual Presentation of Items</title>
<p>Before deciding how to respond to items on a questionnaire, participants must first process and organize visual material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191110382850">Dillman, Smyth, &amp; Christian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073191110382850">Tourangeau, Couper, &amp; Conrad, 2004</xref>). Differences in visual presentation of a questionnaire may lead individuals to interpret items in different ways, which then influences how they respond to each item. Whereas visual presentation of items and response choices is generally fixed for paper-and-pencil versions of questionnaires, visual presentation varies tremendously across online administrations of questionnaires. Visual presentation of items may differ as a result of differences in computer screen size, screen settings (e.g., resolution, brightness, contrast, and color), and browser settings (e.g., text size, font, and spacing). Each of these differences has unique consequences for data integrity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191110382850">Dillman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073191110382850">Tourangeau et al., 2004</xref>, for detailed discussion). In sum, there are differences in how questionnaires are visually presented <italic>between</italic> paper-and-pencil and Internet methods and substantial variability in visual presentation <italic>within</italic> Internet administrations of questionnaires.</p>
<p>There are numerous sources of variability in visual presentation that emerge when transitioning to online administration of paper-and-pencil questionnaires, each having unique consequences for data integrity. First, <italic>proximity of items</italic> varies across questionnaire administrations. Consistent with the principles of gestalt theory, greater physical proximity of items will lead participants to interpret those items as being <italic>conceptually</italic> similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073191110382850">Tourangeau et al., 2004</xref>). As a result, participants are more likely to respond in a more similar manner to items with greater proximity (i.e., item responses will be more strongly correlated). To illustrate, consider the administration of a 30-item questionnaire. Participant A may complete this questionnaire on a large computer screen that allows her to view all the items simultaneously, increasing item proximity and interrelatedness of item responses. In contrast, Participant B may have a smaller computer screen that requires him to scroll through the items, minimizing proximity between the first and last items on the questionnaire (and lowering correlations among item responses). Browser settings may further influence item proximity. Participant A may experience greater item proximity that Participant C (who completed a paper-and-pencil version of the questionnaire) because Participant A’s browser settings group the items more closely than they appear in the paper version.</p>
<p>Second, and also consistent with Gestalt psychology, proximity of <italic>item response choices</italic> differs across administrations. For example, if participants are asked to respond to items using a 5-point Likert-type scale, the physical distance between each point on this scale will vary. If points on the scale have greater physical distance between them, the magnitude between responses will be perceived as greater (i.e., it is a bigger conceptual jump from response 4 to 5). As a result, participants may be more likely to interpret endpoints on this scale as more extreme and, consequently, may be less likely to choose these “extremes.” The resulting problem is a restricted range of responses. In contrast, if points on a scale are closer together, they are viewed as being more closely related (conceptually), thus increasingly the likelihood that participants will respond to the full range of response choices.</p>
<p>Finally, text size and font influence how salient questions are and how readily interpretable they are to participants. Researchers have no control over the legibility of text when questionnaires are administered online. If text appears in a font or size that is not as legible, this will have consequences for how the text is perceived and, consequently, how individuals respond to each item. Furthermore, the brightness, contrast, and color of visual presentation—which vary depending on computer screen settings—influence how well text stands out from the background, which also has consequences for item responding.</p>

<title>Internet Administration Outside of the Laboratory: Environmental and Clinical Issues</title>
<p>The primary reason why Internet data collection has become increasingly popular is because participants can complete measures at home at their convenience. Eliminating the need to visit a laboratory reduces the time commitment for participants (eliminates travel time) and increases flexibility with regard to <italic>when</italic> participants can complete questionnaires. Thus, not only does transitioning to Internet administration of paper-and-pencil questionnaires introduce problems resulting from variability in visual presentation, but the trend toward Internet administration occurring outside of the laboratory also results in the method of data collection being confounded with differences in environmental and clinical factors. Indeed, there are numerous issues that arise as a result of participants completing questionnaires online <italic>and</italic> outside of the laboratory.</p>
<p>First, from a clinical perspective, <italic>degree of anonymity</italic> often differs across these two contexts (i.e., laboratory vs. nonlaboratory). Specifically, the extent to which a participant’s identity is known to research personnel is limited for online (nonlaboratory) administration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191110382850">Luce et al., 2007</xref>). This greater anonymity may result in participants feeling more comfortable reporting sensitive information (prior or current abuse, illegal activities) when providing this information over the Internet as opposed to completing a written version of that same questionnaire in a laboratory. Consequently, average scores on a questionnaire assessing a construct such as relationship conflict may be higher for Internet versus paper-and-pencil administrations. On the other hand, the lack of personal contact limits the opportunity to build rapport with research personnel, which may leave individuals <italic>less</italic> comfortable disclosing sensitive information. Regardless of the direction, differences in anonymity/rapport with research personnel may result in differences in responses.</p>
<p>Second, methodologies differ with regard to degree of <italic>researcher control over the environment</italic> in which questionnaires are completed (e.g., environmental stimuli, distractions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>). Participants completing questionnaires online may choose a computer in a location full of environmental distractions (e.g., at a coffee shop, at a time when children are around), which may lead to more careless responding patterns. Participants may also take more care when answering questions in a laboratory setting, where an “authority figure” (i.e., the person running the session) is present, relative to when they answer questions at home with no researchers present.</p>
<p>Third, issues of privacy (a related environmental issue) cannot be controlled when data are collected online and outside of the laboratory. If participants choose to complete an online questionnaire in a location where friends, family, or one’s children are present, they may be more prone to underreport negative attributes (e.g., psychological symptoms) and overreport positive attributes (e.g., quality of social support) to present themselves in a more positive light. This issue becomes particularly salient when administering questionnaires relevant to couples research, particularly when couples cohabit. Although it is customary to instruct participants to complete questionnaires in a private place (without one’s partner in the room), researchers do not have control over whether participants actually follow these instructions. If one’s partner is in the room while completing questionnaires, this may lead one to underreport negative qualities or behaviors (e.g., the presence of partner aggression) or overreport positive qualities or behaviors (e.g., relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction). Moreover, a lack of privacy might lead a participant to prioritize speed over accuracy of responses, reducing measurement precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191110382850">Hertel et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1073191110382850">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Because of the notable and myriad visual (presentational style), environmental (distractions, privacy), and clinical (anonymity, rapport with the researcher) differences between written and Internet forms of data collection, researchers cannot assume that these methods are interchangeable. Specifically, researchers should not assume that a questionnaire developed via a paper-and-pencil method will still be reliable and valid when administered over the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191110382850">Coles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191110382850">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). As stated in the American Psychological Association’s <italic>Guidelines for Computer-Based Tests and Interpretations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191110382850">1986</xref>), “When interpreting scores from the computerized versions of conventional tests, the equivalence of scores from computerized versions should be established and documented before using norms or cutting scores obtained from conventional tests” (p. 18). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191110382850">Buchanan et al. (2005)</xref> contend that any measure to be administered online must first be independently evaluated for psychometric equivalence, in order to preserve the integrity of the data being collected. For example, the independent examination of psychometric equivalence for a given measure is necessary if scores attained via the Internet are to be compared with normative data collected in written form of that questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>). In sum, before researchers adopt Internet administration of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, the psychometric properties of the measure must be reexamined based on data that are collected online.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1073191110382850">
<title>Examining the Psychometric Equivalence of Measures Used in Couple Research</title>
<p>Psychological researchers have demonstrated the relative psychometric equivalence of written and Internet forms of frequently used measures in numerous research areas, including personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191110382850">Davis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191110382850">Meade, Michels, &amp; Lautenschlager, 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>, for review), eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191110382850">Luce et al., 2007</xref>), obsessive–compulsive disorder (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191110382850">Coles et al., 2007</xref>), panic/agoraphobia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191110382850">Carlbring et al., 2007</xref>), alcohol use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191110382850">Miller et al., 2002</xref>), and physical health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191110382850">Hewson &amp; Charlton, 2005</xref>). Therefore, there is evidence that supports the transition to online data collection in psychological research in general. However, self-report questionnaires typically used in <italic>couple research</italic> have yet to be examined for psychometric equivalence across methods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191110382850">Hamby, Sugarman, &amp; Boney-McCoy, 2006</xref>, for an exception); therefore, couple researchers cannot conclude that they are collecting reliable and valid data on interpersonal constructs if they administer these questionnaires online.</p>
<p>The need to analyze the psychometric equivalence of interpersonal measures extends beyond the simple argument that little attention has been paid to these measures to date. The psychometric equivalence of interpersonal measures has unique implications for couple researchers. First, as couple researchers increasingly embrace a developmental perspective in their research, longitudinal rather than cross-sectional designs are becoming the norm. In such research, subject retention becomes of paramount concern. Moreover, if a study has already begun and will continue for many years (e.g., over the early, high-risk period of marriage), researchers will have presumably been collecting data in written form in the past but may wish to now capitalize on the advantages of collecting data via the Internet. If interpersonal measures do indeed demonstrate psychometric equivalence across methods of administration, researchers can confidently transition from paper-and-pencil to Internet administration (or vice versa) during the longitudinal course of a given study.</p>
<p>Second, couple data already present unique sources of covariation with which couple researchers must contend. When data are collected from both members of a couple, interdependence among the two individuals should be statistically controlled or incorporated into predicted associations among variables by including (a) both actor and partner paths, (b) correlations accounting for the nonindependence between partners’ predictor variables, and (c) correlations accounting for the nonindependence between the error terms of partners’ outcome variables. In short, issues of method and source variance are already uniquely complicated when one is analyzing couple data. We cannot begin to speculate about the extent to which such issues might be moderated by method of administration, let alone the specific nature of that influence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191110382850">Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006</xref>, for more details about issues of actor–partner interdependence).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1073191110382850">
<title>Quantitative and Qualitative Equivalence</title>
<p>There are three widely adopted requirements necessary for establishing psychometric equivalence across different methods of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191110382850">Ghiselli, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191110382850">Ghiselli, Campbell, &amp; Zedeck, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191110382850">Meyerson &amp; Tryon, 2003</xref>). The first requirement is that means attained for each method of administration do not differ significantly from one another. The second requirement is that equal variances are attained for each method. The third requirement is that the covariance structure of the measure with other related or dissimilar constructs is consistent across methods of administration.</p>
<p>The first two requirements (i.e., equal means and variances across methods) are often referred to as <italic>quantitative equivalence</italic>. By examining quantitative equivalence of methods, researchers can determine whether normative data gathered in written form can be applied to data collected via the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073191110382850">Preckel &amp; Thiemann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191110382850">van der Vijver &amp; Harsveld, 1994</xref>). Quantitative <italic>in</italic>equivalence of paper-and-pencil and Internet versions of a given measure can be corrected through transformations or by adding or subtracting constants to final scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191110382850">Meyerson &amp; Tryon, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the examination of quantitative equivalence of distinct measures is necessary for determining <italic>if</italic> transformations are necessary when a given measure is administered online, and <italic>what</italic> transformations should be applied if they are needed. The third requirement (i.e., similar covariance structures) is often referred to as <italic>qualitative equivalence</italic>, and addresses the question of whether or not construct validity of a measure is preserved across methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191110382850">Buchanan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073191110382850">Preckel &amp; Thiemann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191110382850">van der Vijver &amp; Harsveld, 1994</xref>). Qualitative <italic>in</italic>equivalence of paper-and-pencil and Internet methods would suggest that the construct being assessed is not being adequately measured when data are collected via the Internet. Whereas transformations might be applied in the case of quantitative inequivalence across methods, <italic>qualitative</italic> inequivalence must be addressed by redeveloping the measure to ensure construct validity.</p>

<title>Overview of the Present Study</title>
<p>The principal goal of the present study was to examine the psychometric equivalence—across paper-and-pencil and Internet methodologies—of key interpersonal and intrapersonal questionnaires used in couple research. We examined our aims in a sample of young adults (college students) in committed dating relationships for two reasons. First, the need to demonstrate psychometric equivalence of paper-and-pencil and Internet methods is most urgent for populations consisting of college students given that (a) the majority of psychological research is conducted with undergraduate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191110382850">Buchanan &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>) and (b) college students typically have Internet access, making them the most convenient targets for Internet data collection. Second, Internet administration (but not paper-and-pencil administration) may introduce <italic>computer anxiety</italic> (apprehension, insecurity, and lack of comfort using a computer), depending on how familiar and comfortable participants are with using a computer and navigating the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073191110382850">Wilfong, 2006</xref>). State-specific computer anxiety may artificially inflate scores on certain questionnaires (e.g., measures of anxiety) and lower scores on other questionnaires (e.g., measures of self-esteem). Furthermore, response <italic>patterns</italic> may be influenced by the extent to which participants are comfortable using computers. For example, if participants are not effective at using a mouse, they may struggle with clicking on response choices on the web survey, leading to errors in responding. Examining our aims in a sample of undergraduate students allowed us to experimentally control for computer anxiety as a source of method variance. Specifically, younger adults reportedly experience relatively low levels of computer anxiety relative to populations that include older participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191110382850">Pettit, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>There were three aims to the present study. The first aim was to determine whether self-report questionnaires developed for paper-and-pencil administration remain <italic>reliable</italic> when administered via the Internet. Specifically, we examined whether (a) internal consistencies (i.e., Cronbach’s alphas) were adequate when questionnaires were administered online and (b) test–retest reliabilities (i.e., intraclass correlations across a 2-week period) were comparable for written and Internet methodologies. The second aim was to examine the <italic>quantitative equivalence</italic> (i.e., absence of mean and variance differences) of written and Internet methodologies, while controlling for (a) order of method administration (i.e., Internet before written or written before Internet) and (b) temporal change in the variable under investigation over 2 weeks. The third aim was to examine <italic>qualitative equivalence</italic> (i.e., similar correlations among measures) across written and Internet methodologies. Specifically, we examined whether correlations among measures administered in written format would differ from correlations among measures administered via the Internet. We had no reason to expect psychometric <italic>in</italic>equivalence across written and Internet administrations for any of the questionnaires examined in the study; however, this is an empirical question that must be addressed for couple researchers to transition from written to Internet data collection.</p>
<p>Self-report questionnaires examined for psychometric equivalence were chosen to represent the principal constructs assessed in couple research. We chose questionnaires that were (a) widely used in the close relationships literature and (b) that had strong, published psychometric data based on paper-and-pencil administrations of the measures. First, global relationship satisfaction is one of the most common variables examined in the couple research field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073191110382850">Lawrence, Barry, Langer, &amp; Brock, 2009</xref>); therefore, we included two measures of relationship satisfaction in the present study. Second, interpersonal processes (i.e., specific classes of behaviors exchanged between partners) are frequently examined as predictors of relationship satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191110382850">Bradbury, Fincham, &amp; Beach, 2000</xref>). Specifically, the overwhelming majority of research in the close relationships field has been focused on the quality of a couple’s ability to solve problems and conflicts (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191110382850">Bradbury, Fincham, Frank, &amp; Beach, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191110382850">Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995</xref>). Within the last decade or so, there has also been a tremendous increase in attention to the role of partner support as an adaptive dyadic skill (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191110382850">Gable, Gonzaga, &amp; Strachman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191110382850">Neff &amp; Karney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073191110382850">Pasch &amp; Bradbury, 1998</xref>). Still other researchers have focused specifically on emotional intimacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191110382850">Barnes &amp; Sternberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191110382850">Cordova, Gee, &amp; Warren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191110382850">Laurenceau, Barrett, &amp; Rovine, 2005</xref>). Thus, we chose questionnaires assessing these widely investigated interpersonal processes in couple research: communication/conflict management, partner support, and emotional intimacy. Third, researchers also recognize the importance of intrapersonal factors (e.g., partner characteristics, individual stressors) in the developmental course of relationships. Thus, we included measures of key intrapersonal variables that have been conceptualized as correlates of relationship functioning: individual traits and psychological symptoms (positive and negative affect, self-esteem, depression, anxiety, anger and hostility, and attachment styles) and the contextual factors that influence such individual variables (chronic stress and social support from one’s broad social network).</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>Participants included 176 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology course at a public Midwestern university. Eligible participants were older than the age of 18 and in ongoing, exclusive heterosexual romantic relationships. Of the 176 participants who participated in the study, 5 did not complete both waves of data collection and 1 was in a new relationship at Time 2; thus, data from these 6 participants were removed. Furthermore, one participants’ data were deleted because it was revealed during the initial appointment that the participant was not in a relationship and, therefore, was not eligible. Thus, the final sample consisted of 169 participants (135 women and 34 men). Participants ranged in age from 17 to 28 years (<italic>M</italic> = 18.84 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.56 years) and were predominantly Caucasian/non-Hispanic (91.6%). Relationship duration ranged from 1 to 100 months (<italic>M</italic> = 15.07 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.53 months), and 25.4% of participants were cohabiting.</p>
<p>Participants were assigned to one of four groups:</p>

Participants were asked to complete the online questionnaires at a computer of their choosing over the subsequent 48-hour period.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Group 2 (IW), Internet at Time 1, Written at Time 2</italic>: At Time 1, participants attended a laboratory appointment during which they were given the URL for a secure website and asked to complete the questionnaires on this website at a computer of their choosing over the subsequent 48-hour period.

<list-item><p><italic>Group 3 (WW), Written at Time 1, Written at Time 2</italic>: At Time 1, participants attended a laboratory appointment during which they completed written versions of the questionnaires in private laboratory rooms.

<list-item><p><italic>Group 4 (II), Internet at Time 1, Internet at Time 2</italic>: At Time 1, participants attended a laboratory appointment during which they were given a URL and asked to complete the questionnaires at a computer of their choosing over the next 48 hours. Two weeks later (Time 2), participants were e-mailed a URL and asked to complete the questionnaires online over the subsequent 48-hour period.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Participants were recruited via a university-managed online sign-up system. They were told that the purpose of the study was to see how individuals and their relationships change over time, and whether individuals prefer to complete questionnaires in a laboratory or over the Internet. All participants first attended a laboratory appointment during which they were assigned to one of the four groups; order of group assignment was counterbalanced. Groups 1 and 2 were included to control for order effects, and Groups 3 and 4 were included to control for temporal change in the phenomena under investigation. To maintain relevant equivalence between the two methods of administration, questionnaires were administered in the same order for both written and Internet formats. On completion of both time points of data collection, participants received credit for partial fulfillment of a course requirement.</p>

<p>The Quality of Marriage Index (QMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073191110382850">Norton, 1983</xref>) is a 6-item, self-report questionnaire designed to assess the “essential goodness of a relationship.” Participants indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with 5 items using a scale from 1 (= <italic>very strong disagreement</italic>) to 7 (= <italic>very strong agreement</italic>), and rate their global marital “happiness” on a scale from 1 (= <italic>very unhappy</italic>) to 10 (= <italic>perfectly happy</italic>). Items are summed, and composite scores can range from 6 to 45. The QMI demonstrates good convergent and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073191110382850">Heyman, Sayers, &amp; Bellack, 1994</xref>).

<title>Communication and conflict management</title>
<p>The Marital Coping Inventory (MCI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191110382850">Bowman, 1990</xref>) includes 66 items representing actions, thoughts, and feelings specific to dealing with one’s most serious recurring relationship disagreement. First, partners write down their most serious recurring intimate relationship difficulty and rate the seriousness of the problem on a scale from 1 (= <italic>not serious</italic>) to 5 (= <italic>extremely serious</italic>). Second, spouses rate the degree to which they engaged in conflict management behaviors (e.g., sit down and talk things out with my partner). In the present study, a higher score is indicative of greater conflict management (possible range: 64-320). The Quality of Relationships Inventory–Conflict subscale (QRI-Conflict; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191110382850">Pierce, Sarason, &amp; Sarason, 1991</xref>) is a 14-item measure of perceived conflict in one’s relationship. Items are summed, and the possible range of composite scores is from 14 to 70. The Conflict scale of the QRI has demonstrated adequate reliability and validity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191110382850">Pierce et al., 1991</xref>). The Marital Satisfaction Inventory–Revised (MSI-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191110382850">Snyder &amp; Aikman, 1999</xref>) is commonly used to assess the level of distress in couples along 11 dimensions of relationships. We included the Problem Solving Communication (PSC) and Affective Communication (AFC) subscales to measure the degree of negative communication between partners. The PSC and AFC consist of 19 and 13 items, respectively, and participants answer “true” or “false” to each item. Scores can range from 0 to 19 for the PSC and 0 to 13 for the AFC, and higher scores indicate more negative communication patterns.</p>

<title>Partner support</title>
<p>The Support in Intimate Relationships Rating Scale–Revised (SIRRS-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191110382850">Barry, Bunde, Brock, &amp; Lawrence, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191110382850">Dehle, Larsen, &amp; Landers, 2001</xref>) is a 25-item, factor-analytically derived self-report measure of received partner support. The original 48-item SIRRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191110382850">Dehle et al., 2001</xref>) was designed to capture perceptions of support rather than objective indices of support, and to further capitalize on this strength we made two modifications to the SIRRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191110382850">Barry et al., 2009</xref>). First, rather than collecting daily measures of support frequency (as was proposed in the original SIRRS), we collected perceptions of support frequency over the prior month to generate a measure of global support perceptions. Second, in the original SIRRS, participants reported the specific number of supportive behaviors received and the specific number of behaviors preferred. In line with our interest in global perceptions of support adequacy, we asked participants whether they wished to have more, less, or the same amount of each supportive act. Scores of frequency of support could range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicative of more frequent support. Scores of support adequacy could range from 0 to 25 with higher scores representing more adequate support (i.e., closer match between desired and received levels of support). Factor analyses of the SIRRS-R in samples of dating and married couples strongly support the reliability and validity of this measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191110382850">Barry et al., 2009</xref>). The Quality of Relationships Inventory–Support Subscale (QRI-Support; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191110382850">Pierce et al., 1991</xref>) is a 7-item measure of perceived support in one’s relationship.

Participants “rate the extent to which [they] . . . have felt each of the following emotions in the last 2 weeks” on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (= <italic>very slightly or not at all</italic>) to 5 (= <italic>extremely</italic>). Scores are summed across items on each scale and can range from 10 to 50. The PANAS demonstrates strong interrater agreement, temporal stability, and factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191110382850">Watson et al., 1988</xref>). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory (RSEI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073191110382850">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire measuring individual self-esteem. Respondents rate items on Likert-type scales ranging from 1 (= <italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (= <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Summed scores can range from 10 to 40.

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073191110382850">Radloff, 1977</xref>) is a 20-item self-report questionnaire used to assess depressive symptoms experienced in the past week. The CES-D was developed specifically for use with the general population, and items are unambiguous (“I felt sad”). Composite scores can range from 0 to 60, and a higher score is indicative of more frequent depressive symptoms experienced over the week prior to completing the questionnaire. The CES-D not only demonstrates good reliability and validity, but it is also sensitive to changes in depressive symptoms over time; therefore, it has great utility for longitudinal research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1073191110382850">Weissman, Sholomska, Pottenger, Prusoff, &amp; Locke, 1977</xref>). The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191110382850">Beck &amp; Steer, 1990</xref>) is a 21-item self-report questionnaire measuring anxiety symptoms over the last week. The BAI is used in clinical and nonclinical samples. Summed scores can range from 0 to 63. The BAI demonstrates strong internal consistency (α = .92), strong test–retest reliability over 1 week (<italic>r</italic> = .75), and good discriminant and convergent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191110382850">Beck &amp; Steer, 1990</xref>). The Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191110382850">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>) consists of 29 items assessing physical, verbal, affective, and cognitive components of an overall trait of aggression. The Anger Subscale consists of 7 items, represents the affective component of aggression, and involves physiological arousal and preparation for aggression. The Hostility Subscale consists of 8 items, represents the cognitive component of aggression, and consists of feelings of ill will and injustice. Participants respond to items using a 1 (= <italic>extremely uncharacteristic of me</italic>) to 5 (= <italic>extremely characteristic of me</italic>) scale. Scores were summed for each scale (possible ranges include Anger: 7-35 and Hostility: 7-40). Internal consistency of these scales is consistently high (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191110382850">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073191110382850">Martin, Watson, &amp; Wan, 2000</xref>).

<title>Aim 1: Are Paper-and-Pencil Measures Reliable When Administered via the Internet?</title>
<p>To assess internal consistency, we calculated Cronbach’s alphas four times for each questionnaire (i.e., once for each Internet administration): Time 2 for the WI group (Group 1), Time 1 for the IW group (Group 2), and Times 1 and 2 for the II group (Group 4). All questionnaires had αs in the acceptable range across the four occasions of Internet administration (αs &gt; .70, ranging from .76 to .99). Alphas were also within the acceptable range for the four occasions of written administration (αs &gt; .70, ranging from .71 to .97).</p>
<p>As per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191110382850">Cicchetti’s (1994)</xref> recommendation for assessing test–retest reliability within participants, we calculated intraclass correlations (ICCs) between scores obtained across the 2-week period. Two ICCs were calculated for each questionnaire: one correlation for Group 3 (WW: written administration at Times 1 and 2) and one correlation for Group 4 (II: Internet administration at Times 1 and 2). ICCs are located along the diagonals of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191110382850">Tables 2</xref> (for interpersonal measures) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191110382850">3</xref> (for intrapersonal measures). (WW correlations are located along the top of the diagonal and II correlations are located along the bottom of the diagonal). Fisher’s <italic>z</italic> tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191110382850">Dunn &amp; Clark, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191110382850">1971</xref>) were performed to compare ICCs for each measure across methods of administration (i.e., WW vs. II). In general, there were no significant differences in the test–retest reliabilities (i.e., ICCs) for WW versus II groups, with a few exceptions. ICCs differed significantly from one another for (a) the BAI (<italic>z</italic> = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; <italic>r</italic> = .94 for the WW group; <italic>r</italic> = .84 for the II group), (b) the SPS (<italic>z</italic> = 2.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; <italic>r</italic> = .82 for the WW group; <italic>r</italic> = .58 for the II group), (c) the QMI (<italic>z</italic> = 2.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005; <italic>r</italic> = .83 for the WW group; <italic>r</italic> = .95 for the II group), and (d) the QRI-Conflict (<italic>z</italic> = 2.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; <italic>r</italic> = .94 for the WW group; <italic>r</italic> = .86 for the II group). However, despite these differences, for three of these four measures, intraclass correlations were high in magnitude for both II and WW groups (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .70). For the SPS, reliabilities varied in magnitude across groups: test–retest reliability was poor for the II group but high for the WW group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the numerous advantages of collecting self-report data online, researchers are rapidly transitioning from paper-and-pencil (i.e., written) administration of questionnaires to administration via the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191110382850">Birnbaum, 2004</xref>). However, the majority of questionnaires that are used in couple research were developed as paper assessments; therefore, psychometric equivalence of paper-and-pencil and Internet methodologies must be established before a given questionnaire can be administered online. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the psychometric equivalence of questionnaires commonly used in couple research. In general, both intrapersonal and interpersonal measures remained reliable when administered online and demonstrated both quantitative and qualitative equivalence across methods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1073191110382850">Table 4</xref> for a summary of the results).</p>

<title>Summary and Interpretation of Results</title>
<p>Our first aim was to determine whether self-report questionnaires developed for paper-and-pencil administration remain <italic>reliable</italic> when administered via the Internet. Internal consistency was adequate for Internet administration of paper-and-pencil questionnaires and test–retest reliability was equivalent across written and Internet methods, with one exception. The SPS demonstrated poor test–retest reliability when administered via the Internet; in contrast, test–retest reliability was high when administered in written form.</p>
<p>Our second aim was to examine the <italic>quantitative equivalence</italic> (absence of mean and variance differences) of interpersonal and intrapersonal measures across paper-and-pencil and Internet methodologies, controlling for order of method administration and temporal change. Both intrapersonal and interpersonal measures demonstrated quantitative equivalence.</p>
<p>Our third aim was to examine the <italic>qualitative equivalence</italic> (similar correlations among measures) of intrapersonal and interpersonal measures across paper-and-pencil and Internet methodologies. Intrapersonal measures uniformly demonstrated strong qualitative equivalence with only a couple of exceptions. First, the PANAS Negative Affect Scale and the ECR Avoidant Attachment Scale were significantly correlated when administered online but were not significantly correlated when administered in written form. Given that insecure attachment is associated with poor affect regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191110382850">Fuendeling, 1998</xref>), a significant correlation—as demonstrated for the Internet administration—was expected. Second, the CES-D was significantly associated with the CSI across both methods; however, this correlation was stronger for the written administration. Although we were surprised by these two instances of differences in correlations across modes of administration, we concluded that these measures can be administered online because qualitative inequivalence was not pervasive (i.e., the majority of correlations among measures were equivalent across methods).</p>
<p>Qualitative equivalence was also generally good for <italic>interpersonal</italic> measures, with a couple of exceptions. First, the MSI-R AFC Scale and the Sternberg Triangular Love Scale–Passion Subscale were significantly and negatively correlated with one another across both methods; however, this correlation was stronger for Internet administration. Second, the Sternberg Triangular Love Scale–Passion Subscale and the SIRRS Frequency of Support Scale were significantly and positively correlated across both methods; however, this correlation was also stronger for Internet administration. Despite these two exceptions, we concluded that these measures can be administered online because qualitative inequivalence was not pervasive.</p>
<p>In sum, although researchers should be cognizant of the relations among specific variables that may be affected—such as the exceptions noted above—researchers can assume intrapersonal and interpersonal questionnaires that were originally validated in written form are assessing the same constructs when administered online.</p>

<title>Strengths, Limitations, and Implications of the Present Study</title>
<p>There were several positive features of the present study. First, the aims were explored in a sample of college students. Given that the majority of psychological research is conducted with college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191110382850">Buchanan &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>), and given that college students are a highly desirable population for researchers wishing to capitalize on the advantages of Internet data collection, the need to demonstrate psychometric equivalence across paper-and-pencil and Internet methods is most urgent for this population. Furthermore, college students are expected to experience lower levels of computer anxiety, which allowed us to control for this potential source of method variance. Second, comparisons across methods were conducted both between and within subjects, which allowed us to control for both temporal stability of the constructs under investigation and order of method administration.</p>
<p>Several factors may also limit the generalizability of our findings. First, older adults are expected to be less proficient with computers and to experience greater computer anxiety compared with young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191110382850">Pettit, 1999</xref>). Therefore, our findings may not necessarily extend to samples of older adults who have limited experience using computers and the Internet. Second, our sample consisted of individuals in self-defined committed, exclusive relationships with a mean length of 15 months and for which 25.4% were cohabiting. Nevertheless, though we have no reason to expect differential results, without replication we cannot conclude that these findings generalize to married couples, for example. Third, although the sample size was adequate for testing our hypotheses of interest, replication in a larger sample is recommended. Fourth, the sample consisted primarily of White, non-Hispanic women. The advantage of this sample is that almost all published research in which these questionnaires are administered has been conducted on this exact population. Thus, our use of this sample makes our findings more generalizable to the relevant literature than a more diverse sample would; however, the demographic features of our sample limit our ability to generalize psychometric equivalence of these measures to ethnic minorities or males. Fifth, measures included in the present study were chosen to represent key constructs examined by couple researchers: communication/conflict management, support, and emotional intimacy. However, we cannot conclude that our pattern of findings generalizes to all measures of these constructs or to other constructs that couple researchers may wish to investigate; such measures must still be examined for psychometric equivalence before they are administered over the Internet.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of the present study have several positive implications for researchers investigating both intrapersonal and interpersonal phenomena. First, researchers can generally expect measures to be internally consistent when administered online. (Of course, as with written formats, Cronbach’s alphas should be routinely examined each time a questionnaire is administered to a new sample of participants.) Second, the quantitative equivalence we found across methods suggests that published norms for paper-and-pencil versions of measures can be applied when measures are collected via the Internet. Third, the qualitative equivalence of intrapersonal and interpersonal measures was generally adequate. Therefore, researchers can be confident that they are assessing the constructs they intend to measure when administering paper-and-pencil questionnaires online. Fourth, as close relationships researchers increasingly embrace a developmental perspective in their research, longitudinal rather than cross-sectional designs are becoming the norm. If a study has already begun and will continue for many years (e.g., over the early, high-risk period of marriage), researchers will presumably have been collecting data in written form but may wish to capitalize on the advantages of collecting data via the Internet. Our findings that measures demonstrate psychometric equivalence suggests that researchers can transition from paper-and-pencil to Internet administration (or vice versa) throughout the course of such a study. For example, if research participants relocate and cannot return to the laboratory to complete a time point of data collection, online administration may be a reliable and valid alternative. Being able to switch administration formats within participants also has particular utility for clinical research. Participants may fill out written questionnaires while attending initial appointments and then switch to filling out questionnaires from home via the Internet for follow-up assessment periods (i.e., following treatment termination).</p>

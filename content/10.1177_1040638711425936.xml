<p>Microbiological culture of milk samples has been used as a standard diagnosis for <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> mastitis. This technique is effective in isolating mollicutes that are <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>-like; however, isolates may be misinterpreted as <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species, which are indistinguishable from <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species by culture. A study to contrast the abilities of 2 culture-based tests, digitonin and nisin disc diffusion assays and a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, to discriminate between <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> was performed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene partial sequencing as the gold standard of comparison. A total of 288 bovine mollicute field isolates (248 from milk and 40 from other organ sites) and 13 reference strains were tested. Results obtained from the digitonin disc diffusion assay when it was performed with all field isolates were 92.7% and 99.0% in agreement with the gold standard using 5 mm and 3 mm of zone of growth inhibition as thresholds, respectively. Considering only milk isolates, agreements between the digitonin disc diffusion assay with the gold standard were 97.2% and 100% using 5 mm and 3 mm of zone of growth inhibition as thresholds, respectively. Culture identification using the nisin disc diffusion assay and the PCR was in a 100% agreement with the gold standard. Comparable results using culture-based nisin and digitonin disc diffusion assays, and PCR, to distinguish <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species was found, especially for isolates from bovine milk.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species have been reported to cause severe mastitis in dairy cattle worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638711425936">7</xref></sup> <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species that cause mastitis are categorized as contagious organisms that can be readily transmitted from cow to cow. Precise detection of infected animals at an early stage is a critical component of mycoplasma mastitis control strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638711425936">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species are fastidious pathogens and have special growth requirements, and isolation of these organisms requires a specific medium, such as modified Hayflick agar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638711425936">9</xref></sup> <italic>Acholeplasma laidlawii</italic> is a common nonpathogenic saprophytic contaminant in the dairy environment and is occasionally found in both tank-milk and cow-milk samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638711425936">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638711425936">13</xref></sup> <italic>Acholeplasma laidlawii</italic> is normally considered a nonpathogenic agent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638711425936">12</xref></sup> although some studies reported the isolation of this species from mastitic milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638711425936">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638711425936">20</xref></sup> <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species cannot be distinguished from <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species on modified Hayflick medium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638711425936">9</xref></sup> Therefore, additional discriminatory tests are needed to distinguish between <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma.</italic> A major difference between <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> is their sterol requirement. <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species are unable to synthesize sterols or fatty acids and thus require exogenous sterol from media.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638711425936">18</xref></sup> <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species do not require exogenous cholesterol for growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638711425936">23</xref></sup> Digitonin can form a complex with sterol, interrupting the uptake of exogenous sterol by <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> but not <italic>Acholeplasma.</italic> Thus, growth of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> but not <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> is inhibited by digitonin.</p>
<p>Nisin, an antimicrobial peptide, can also be used to differentiate between <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711425936">1</xref></sup> Nisin is produced by <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> and can inhibit growth of most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711425936">1</xref></sup> It has been reported that nisin readily inhibited growth of <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species whereas <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species were substantially less affected by nisin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711425936">1</xref></sup> and, therefore, it has been proposed that a nisin disc diffusion assay on agar plates could be used to distinguish between these 2 genera.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711425936">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species can also be distinguished based on their genotypic characteristics. A duplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for detection has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638711425936">25</xref></sup> The PCR assay was designed to target the 16S-23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) intergenic spacer (IGS) region. Because more than one operon of transfer RNA genes in the targeted IGS region are usually presented in the genome of <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> but not in the genome of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638711425936">19</xref></sup> more than one size of amplicon are usually detected with <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species whereas only one size of amplicon is presented with <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species. This enables the discrimination of <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species from other <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species using a PCR assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638711425936">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Discrimination of <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species from <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species has been practiced using the digitonin and/or the nisin disc diffusion assay, and by PCR methods, for several years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711425936">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638711425936">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638711425936">27</xref></sup> What is not known is how comparable are these tests of mollicute genera and how accurately these tests can discriminate between these genera. Several local and/or regional veterinary practices who manage their own diagnostic services have inquired on the utility of PCR or digitonin assays in <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species identification. An extensive comparative study using a significantly large set of field isolates of various mollicute species has not been conducted. A tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638711425936">26</xref></sup> assay system for PCR analysis of mastitis pathogens in milk that is commercially available<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638711425936">a</xref></sup> has limitations in that the assay does not analyze <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species, and the supplementary kit<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638711425936">b</xref></sup> only detects <italic>Mycoplasma bovis</italic>. Thus, at best, the tested commercial PCR system available will identify <italic>M. bovis</italic> but not other mollicutes. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine agreement at the genus identification level of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species obtained from the digitonin and nisin disc diffusion assays and PCR, using the 16S rRNA gene partial sequence analysis as a gold standard.</p>

<p>A total of 288 isolates from bovine sources were collected.

After incubation, all plates were examined under the stereomicroscope, and the zones of inhibition were measured from the edge of the disc to the edge of clear zone of no growth (mm). Digitonin tests were considered positive when the clear zone was &gt;5 mm, negative when the zone was &lt;3 mm, and all else would normally be considered an ambiguous result.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main focus of the current study was to contrast the accuracy of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species identification using the digitonin and nisin disc diffusion assays and PCR, as compared to the gold standard 16S rRNA gene partial sequencing technique. The nisin and PCR tests were in perfect agreement (100%) with the gold standard. Results obtained from the digitonin disc diffusion assay agreed more than 90% of the time with the gold standard. The use of a threshold of &gt;5 mm in the digitonin assay yielded 92.7% agreement, while a threshold of &gt;3 mm yielded 99% agreement with the gold standard. Moreover, the <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species tested all had zones of growth inhibition of &lt;3 mm. Therefore, the results obtained from the digitonin disc diffusion assay can distinguish between the 2 genera originally isolated from mastitis cases. In aggregate, these findings indicate that all 3 techniques performed in the present study can be used to distinguish between <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species isolated from bovine origin, and from milk samples specifically, with a high degree of certainty. Of culture-based tests, the nisin disc assay appeared to be superior to the digitonin.</p>
<p>Two hundred forty-eight isolates tested in the current study (86.1%) were from milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis. Of these mastitis isolates, 85.5% (212/248), 4.4% (11/248), and 0.8% (2/248) were <italic>M. bovis, M. californicum</italic>, and <italic>M. bovigenitalium</italic>, and 9.3% (23/248) were identified to be other species. This finding is consistent with other studies done in California identifying <italic>M. bovis</italic> as the most prevalent <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species, followed by <italic>M. californicum</italic> and <italic>M. bovigenitalium</italic>, isolated from samples of clinical mastitis cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638711425936">11</xref></sup> and bulk-tank milk samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638711425936">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The digitonin disc diffusion assay has been used as a standard method to discriminate <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species from <italic>Mycoplasm</italic>a species in many laboratories capable of culturing <italic>Mollicutes</italic> as suggested by the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of <italic>Mollicutes.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638711425936">10</xref></sup> In the current study, all isolates identified to be <italic>M. bovis, M. bovigenitalium</italic>, and <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> were accurately identified as <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> based on the presence of zone of growth inhibition using either &gt;5 mm or &gt;3 mm as a threshold. Using the zone of growth inhibition threshold of &gt;5 mm as suggested previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638711425936">28</xref></sup> 68.2% (15/22) of <italic>M. californicum</italic> isolates were misclassified. Using the zone of growth inhibition threshold of &gt;3 mm, all mycoplasma isolates originally isolated from milk samples were correctly categorized as <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species. There were only 3 isolates originally isolated from bovine lung tissues (2 <italic>M. yeatsii</italic> isolates and 1 <italic>M. cottewii</italic> isolate) that were slightly sensitive to digitonin (1 mm of zone of growth inhibition) and thus would be misclassified regardless of the threshold of zone of inhibition used. Results from the current study for these 3 isolates differ from another report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638711425936">6</xref></sup> where the sensitivity to digitonin was greater as measured by a zone of growth inhibition of 6–11 mm for <italic>M. yeatsii</italic> and <italic>M. cottewii</italic>.</p>
<p>It appears that zones of growth inhibition by the digitonin disc diffusion assay vary by species. Larger zones of growth inhibition (mean ± SE) were observed for <italic>M. bovigenitalium</italic> (15.30 ± 0.67 mm), <italic>M. alkalescens</italic> (12.75 ± 0.48 mm), and <italic>M. bovis</italic> (11.89 ± 0.07 mm) compared to <italic>M. californicum</italic> (5.23 ± 0.19 mm) and <italic>M. arginini</italic> (5.20 ± 0.92 mm). An earlier study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638711425936">27</xref></sup> reported larger zones for <italic>M. arginini</italic> (12 mm) and <italic>M. californicum</italic> (9.74 mm) whereas small zones were observed for <italic>M. canadense</italic> (8.35 mm) and <italic>M. alkalescens</italic> (7.87 mm). In the current study, the digitonin disc diffusion assay correctly identified <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> isolates. Several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638711425936">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638711425936">14</xref></sup> demonstrated some variation of zones of growth inhibition of <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species isolated from bovine origin. The studies reported zones of inhibition of <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species to digitonin ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mm. Another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638711425936">27</xref></sup> reported zones of inhibition among 20 isolates of <italic>A. laidlawii</italic> ranging from 1 to 4 mm. However, all <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> isolates included in the current study showed no zone of growth inhibition around the digitonin discs.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the nisin disc diffusion assay could be used to discriminate <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> from <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711425936">1</xref></sup> All 5 <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species had zones of inhibition whereas all 11 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species did not show any zone of inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638711425936">1</xref></sup> The findings of the current study were similar in that growth of all <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> and no <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> were inhibited by the nisin discs at 2 concentration levels. There was no advantage to using the more concentrated solution (N0) of nisin as opposed to a ten-fold diluted concentration (N-1).</p>
<p>The PCR also had 100% agreement with the gold standard. Although PCR-based platforms for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk have been evaluated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638711425936">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638711425936">21</xref></sup> an extensive study of the ability of PCR assays to distinguish between <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species using field-based milk samples has not been made. The results reported herein are consistent with previous findings that identified 2 PCR products for <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species and 1 PCR product for all <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638711425936">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study suggests a high and comparable efficiency of using nisin and digitonin disc diffusion assays and PCR to distinguish <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species. Thus, the study confirms those of others that all the assays can distinguish between <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species. Choosing a technique to use to discriminate between <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species depends upon the instrumentation requirements, labor, cost, and toxicity of chemicals. Smaller veterinary service diagnostic laboratories may choose to use the less sophisticated tests of the digitonin or nisin disc diffusion–based assays. The PCR assay requires more instrumentation but will generate a more rapid result. Results of the current study indicate that the nisin and digitonin disc diffusion assays performed well and yielded accurate results for standard culture of isolates of veterinary origin. The genotypic test, using PCR assay, was very effective in discriminating mollicutes as a <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> or <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> species.</p>

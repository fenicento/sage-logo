<title>Background and objective:</title>
<p>Limited information is available regarding the impact of prior outpatient use of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) in patients subsequently developing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We investigate the effects of prior SCS on severity of illness, microbiology and clinical outcomes for patients hospitalized with CAP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753465812458985">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study of subjects with CAP (according to International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition codes) was conducted over a 3-year period at two tertiary teaching hospitals. Subjects were considered to be SCS users if they received oral corticosteroids prior to admission. Primary outcomes were severity of illness, microbiology and 30-day mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1753465812458985">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Data were abstracted on 698 patients [prior SCS users, 75 (10.7%) <italic>versus</italic> prior non-SCS users 623 (89.3%)]. Prior SCS users were more likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No differences were found in severity of disease at admission, microbiological etiology including opportunistic and drug-resistant pathogens and clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, intensive care unit admission, length of hospital stay, need for mechanical ventilation and need for vasopressors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753465812458985">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Prior SCS use is not associated with increased 30-day mortality for patients hospitalized with CAP. In addition, no differences were found in either the severity of the disease at the time of presentation or in the presence of the resistant or opportunistic pathogens among groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory agents widely used to treat many autoimmune and respiratory conditions. Corticosteroids influence the function of macrophages and granulocytes, the two major cells in host defenses against opportunistic and bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753465812458985">Rhen and Cidlowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753465812458985">Schacke <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>]. Numerous reports of opportunistic pulmonary infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753465812458985">Stuck <italic>et al</italic>. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753465812458985">Conesa <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753465812458985">Wiest <italic>et al</italic>. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753465812458985">Maskell <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>] and potentially highly resistant bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753465812458985">Falguera <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753465812458985">Sousa <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>] have been described in patients receiving systemic corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Excessive inflammatory response has been linked as the main cause of death by infection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753465812458985">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753465812458985">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753465812458985">Jemal <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>]. It has been postulated that the acute administration of systemic corticosteroids may act as immunomodulators of this excessive inflammatory response by attenuating inflammatory cytokines in patients with pneumonia and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753465812458985">Monton <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753465812458985">Sibila <italic>et al</italic>. 2008a</xref>]. However, the use of systemic corticosteroids remains a matter of controversy due to the variable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753465812458985">Confalonieri <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753465812458985">Garcia-Vidal <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753465812458985">Snijders <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753465812458985">Meijvis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. Some authors have shown a benefit of the acute administration of corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753465812458985">Confalonieri <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753465812458985">Garcia-Vidal <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. However, a lack of improved clinical outcomes has precluded the generalizability of the use of systemic corticosteroids for patients with pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753465812458985">Snijders <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753465812458985">Meijvis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. In addition, limited data are available about the impact of prior outpatient corticosteroid administration in patients subsequently developing CAP.</p>
<p>Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effects of prior outpatient systemic corticosteroid use on etiology, severity of illness and clinical outcomes for patients hospitalized with CAP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1753465812458985" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with CAP at two academic teaching tertiary care hospitals in San Antonio, TX. The Institutional Review Board of the University Health Science Center at San Antonio approved the research protocol with exempt status.</p>
<sec id="section7-1753465812458985">
<title>Study sites/inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
<p>We identified all patients admitted to the study hospitals between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2002 with a primary discharge diagnosis of pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition codes 480.0-483.99 or 485-487.0) or secondary discharge diagnosis of pneumonia with a primary diagnosis of respiratory failure (518.81) or sepsis (038.xx). Subjects were included if they were over 18 years of age, had an admission diagnosis of CAP, and had a radiographically confirmed infiltrate or other finding consistent with CAP on chest X-ray or computed tomography scan obtained within 24 h of admission. Exclusion criteria included having been discharged from an acute care facility within 14 days of admission, transfer after being admitted to another acute care hospital, having comfort measures only on this admission, and using inhaled corticosteroids (to avoid possible interferences between both steroid treatments). If a subject was admitted more than once during the study period, only the first hospitalization was abstracted</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1753465812458985">
<title>Data abstraction</title>
<p>Chart review data included demographics, comorbid conditions, physical examination findings, laboratory data, guideline-concordant empirical antibiotic therapy and chest radiographic reports. Comorbid conditions were identified from either the admission or discharge notes or outpatient problem lists. Antimicrobial therapy was considered guideline concordant if it agreed with the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753465812458985">Niederman <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>]. Information on all corticosteroid outpatient medications that were either reported as currently being taken by the patient at presentation, or listed in the electronic medical record were recorded. Systemic corticosteroid (SCS) therapy was defined if the patient was receiving systemic prednisone, hydrocortisone, cortisone, dexamethasone, fludrocortisones, or methylprednisolone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1753465812458985">
<title>Diagnostic criteria</title>
<p>Microbiologic data results were reviewed, and a microbiologic cause was assigned independently by two of the investigators (M.I.R. and E.M.M.). The cause of pneumonia was considered if one of the following conditions was met: positive blood cultures for bacterial or fungal pathogens (in the absence of extra-pulmonary source of infection); pleural fluid cultures yielding a bacterial pathogen; endotracheal aspirates with moderate or heavy growth of bacterial pathogens; significant quantitative culture growth from bronchoscopic respiratory samples (protected specimen brush cultures of at least 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/ml, and in bronchoalveolar lavage of at least 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/ml). When two or more microbiologic causes were present, the patient was considered to have a polymicrobial infection. A patient was considered to have CAP of unknown cause if microbiologic studies were not performed or inconclusive.</p>
<p>Drug-resistant pathogens were defined as having one of the following microorganisms: drug-resistant <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> (DRSP – including resistance to penicillins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or cephalosporins), methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic>, extended spectrum β lactamases (ESBL), or multidrug-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (resistance to three or more antimicrobial categories).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1753465812458985">
<title>Clinical outcomes</title>
<p>Primary outcomes selected were severity of illness at the time of presentation defined by the pneumonia severity index (PSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753465812458985">Fine <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>], CURB-65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753465812458985">Lim <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>], the presence of modified severe CAP criteria according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/ATS guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753465812458985">Mandell <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>], and severe sepsis and septic shock according to the ACCP consensus statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753465812458985">Bone <italic>et al</italic>. 1992</xref>]; presence of resistant or opportunistic pathogens; and 30-day mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for vasopressors, and requiring mechanical ventilation. Length of hospital stay was calculated as the date of discharge minus the date of admission excluding those who died during hospitalization.</p>
<p>Mortality was assessed using information from the Texas Department of Health and Department of Veteran Affairs clinical database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1753465812458985">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>For the statistical analyses, patients were stratified into either having received prior SCS or not. Bivariate statistics were used to test the association of demographic and clinical characteristics with primary and secondary outcomes. Categorical variables were analyzed using the χ<sup>2</sup> test and continuous variables were analyzed using Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. We created survival curves using a Cox proportional hazard model for the dependent variable of 30-day mortality adjusting for severity of illness. We used logistic regression to examine <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as the dependent variable and adjusted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1753465812458985" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We identified 698 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, 75 (10.7%) patients had received outpatient SCS prior to admission and 623 (89.3%) had not received prior SCS.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753465812458985">Table 1</xref> shows the patients’ demographic characteristics whether or not they received outpatient SCS therapy. No significant differences were found for the mean age, physical exam, laboratory, and radiological data. Prior SCS users were less likely to be men and more likely to have COPD.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding of our study was that prior outpatient use of SCS is not associated with increased 30-day mortality for patients hospitalized with CAP. In addition, no differences in either the severity of the disease at the time of clinical presentation or in the presence of resistant or opportunistic pathogens were found among groups.</p>
<p>The relationship between systemic corticosteroids and pneumonia is one of the more important questions that has yet to be resolved in the field of respiratory infections. More than 50 years after the first publication about the effect of corticosteroids in pneumococcal pneumonia there is still significant controversy about the impact of SCS in patients hospitalized with CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753465812458985">Wagner <italic>et al</italic>. 1956</xref>]. Corticosteroids inhibit cytokines and other inflammatory molecules stimulated by bacterial infections, which could be harmful for the host. Furthermore, the use of steroids also suppresses the immune function of macrophages and granulocytes, the main cell host defenses against bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753465812458985">Rhen and Cidlowski, 2005</xref>]. Several studies have shown that patients with any degree of immunosuppression tend to have more severe pneumonia than immunocompetent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753465812458985">Sousa <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753465812458985">Sanders <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. By contrast, an excessive inflammatory response has been described as a marker of pneumonia severity at admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753465812458985">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>], and corticosteroids have also been postulated as modulators of that response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753465812458985">Rano <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. Our study did not find differences in the severity of illness at admission, defined by different scores such as PSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753465812458985">Fine <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>], CURB-65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753465812458985">Lim <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>], severe IDSA/ATS criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753465812458985">Mandell <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>], and severe sepsis and septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753465812458985">Bone <italic>et al</italic>. 1992</xref>], suggesting that prior SCS use may not play such an important role, either for or against, in the severity of CAP at admission. However, a trend to less pleural effusion was observed in the SCS group.</p>
<p>Different reports have identified an increase in the incidence of different opportunistic infections of the lung, such as <italic>Aspergillus spp</italic> (4), <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecci (6)</italic>, and <italic>Nocardia spp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753465812458985">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>] in patients taking outpatient corticosteroids. Our study did not identify any of these opportunistic microorganisms as the cause of pneumonia in hospitalized patients with CAP treated as outpatients with SCS. The most common pathogen isolated in our cohort of hospitalized CAP patients treated with outpatients SCS was <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Numerous previous reports associated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to corticosteroid use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753465812458985">Falguera <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>] and to COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753465812458985">Murphy <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>]. In our study, after adjusting for SCS and COPD, presence of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> was only associated with COPD (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–8.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and not to the use of outpatient SCS (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.9–5.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09). Furthermore, we did not identify more potentially multi-drug-resistant pathogens in the prior SCS group. These findings suggested that prior corticosteroid administration might not be responsible for variation of habitual flora in CAP.</p>
<p>In addition, there were no differences in 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes such as LOS, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors between groups in our study. Agusti and colleagues previously reported that patients with long-term SCS therapy (&gt;30 days) prior to admission for severe pneumonia who require mechanical ventilation had higher a mortality rate than patients with short-term SCS therapy or patients with severe pneumonia without SCS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753465812458985">Agusti <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>]. The small and heterogeneous sample size evaluated (only nine patients with long-term SCS and mechanical ventilation) precludes comparisons with our findings. The rest of the studies that have studied the impact of SCS treatment on CAP mortality have evaluated the acute administration of SCS after CAP diagnosis, instead of the impact of the chronic outpatient use of SCS. The acute administration of SCS has been shown to be beneficial in decreasing 30-day mortality in patients with severe CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753465812458985">Confalonieri <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753465812458985">Garcia-Vidal <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. In contrast, other studies did not find the benefit of acute administration of SCS in patients hospitalized with CAP, making the generalizability of a recommendation that may impact clinical practice very complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753465812458985">Snijders <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753465812458985">Meijvis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. Currently, there are two randomized controlled trials that are assessing the efficacy of acute administration of SCS. One of these trials has completed subject enrollment and may disclose its final results soon. The other is a large randomized controlled trial in patients with severe CAP admitted to the ICU, with an expected sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 1450) which is currently enrolling patients (Extended Steroid in CAP – ESCAPe [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01283009]).</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective study involving only two centers with a relatively small simple size. Second, our sample was predominately men due to the higher population of veterans enrolled in this cohort. It is unknown if prior SCS use in women would have similar results. And third, our cohort did not have information regarding the indication, dose, duration, and stopping of SCS. These are important since there are studies reporting that if given for a short period of time, the right dose may be favorable and result in an attenuated inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753465812458985">Garcia-Vidal <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753465812458985">Agusti <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753465812458985">Sibila <italic>et al</italic>. 2008b</xref>]. Further studies should consider measuring inflammatory biomarkers when assessing immunomodulatory agents such as SCS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, prior SCS use in patients hospitalized with CAP was not associated with higher severity of the disease at presentation, etiology or clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality. Further prospective cohort and randomized controlled trials are needed to overcome the limitations of our current study and prior studies, and to finally lay to rest the controversy of SCS in pneumonia.</p>

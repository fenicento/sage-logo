<abstract>
<p>The incidence of breast cancer has recently been ranked first in Korea. This is a population-based cohort study that aims to evaluate the risk of breast cancer from the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). A total of 9579 participants were observed between January 1998 and June 2004; 6108 women who took HRT constituted the HRT group, and 3471 women who did not take HRT constituted the non-HRT group. Using the database from the Korea Central Cancer Registry, the authors examined the incidence of breast cancer from HRT. A total of 26 cases of breast cancer developed in the HRT group as compared with the 13 cases in the non-HRT group, during the follow-up period. The relative risk of developing breast cancer in the HRT group was 1.16 times higher than in the non-HRT group, with a population attributable risk of 29.9%. The risk of breast cancer in the HRT group increased when the risk factors were adjusted in the model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the 1992 European-Canadian Conference on HRT, it was suggested that menopausal syndrome was an endocrine disorder. In light of this argument, primary management for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal syndrome has been under way in Korea. It has been reported that hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is the most effective treatment for menopausal syndrome, carries an increased risk of breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510379392">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510379392">2</xref></sup> However, the increased risk of breast cancer from HRT in Korean women has not been investigated until now.</p>
<p>According to the 2000 Population and Housing Census in Korea,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510379392">3</xref></sup> there were a total of 22 917 108 women out of 45 985 289, constituting 49.8% of the population. Out of the total number of women, 5 210 596 representing 22.7% of the group were postmenopausal women older than 49 years. This is an increase from the 20.2% represented in 1995. About 5.2% used HRT continuously, and 20.8% had taken HRT at least once. Using these figures, it is known that the compliance with HRT was 25% in Korea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510379392">4</xref></sup> A study performed in the United States reported that the use of HRT was 38% in postmenopausal women 50 to 75 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510379392">5</xref></sup> In addition, these estimates closely match those seen in the United Kingdom, where a third of the women studied took HRT for an average of 5.8 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510379392">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of the age-specific incidence pattern, the rates of breast cancer showed a peak around the perimenopausal period in Korea,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510379392">7</xref></sup> which was also found in Japan and Taiwan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510379392">8</xref></sup> This incidence pattern was different from that in Western countries, where age-specific rates increased sharply up to the age of menopause but at a slower rate above that age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510379392">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510379392">10</xref></sup> According to the results of the Korea Central Cancer Registry, 16.8% of all female cancer cases in 2002 were breast cancer cases, and it was ranked first, with a total of 43 627 cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510379392">11</xref></sup> Age-standardized incidence rates of breast cancer for women was 0.02 per 100 000 in the 0 to 14 age group, 15.56 in the 15 to 44 age group, 66.24 in the 45 to 54 age group, 53.11 in the 55 to 64 age group, and 27.22 in the 65 and older age group. This indicates that the incidence of breast cancer reaches a maximum in women aged 45 to 54 years and decreases thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510379392">12</xref></sup> The median age at diagnosis of invasive cancer in Korean women was 46 years, which almost did not change during the 10-year period. However, the average annual percentage change for incidence rates standardized to the Korea 2000 population was 7.2% in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510379392">7</xref></sup> It seemed to be much higher than that in European countries, where it ranged from 0.8% to 3.0%, even after taking into account the different standard population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510379392">13</xref></sup> This study was undertaken to evaluate the risk of breast cancer from the use of HRT for menopausal women in Korea.</p>

<title>Population and Methods</title>
<p>The population living in Suwon in Korea between January 1998 and June 2004 participated in this study. During the study period, we observed 6108 women of perimenopausal status, taking HRT for the management of postmenopausal syndrome, from Ajou University Hospital. The non-HRT group of 3471 women of perimenopausal status who visited the Health Promotion Center at Ajou University Hospital for regular check-ups were selected during the same period. Eligibility was defined as age 40 to 75 years at initial screening, and we excluded those individuals who were admitted with a history of breast cancer or oophorectomy. Therefore, a total of 9579 study participants were observed. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, Korea.</p>
<p>Sociodemographic characteristics of the participants as well as maternity and lifestyle factors were surveyed by questionnaire. Height and weight were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (Inbody 3.0, Biospace, Korea, 2001) following overnight fast. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510379392">14</xref></sup> We evaluated the known risk factors for breast cancer such as alcohol intake and smoking status, exercise, parity, age at first pregnancy, whether the participant breast-fed or not, the age at menarche and at menopause, and whether there was any family history of breast cancer. To ascertain the incidence of breast cancer cases, the list of study participants was merged with the Korean National Cancer Incidence Database by resident registration number. The Korean National Cancer Incidence Database was well developed and enough to follow up the incidence of breast cancer. Breast cancer events during the follow-up period were retrospectively recorded, and the mean follow-up period was 6.6 years.</p>

<sec id="section4-1010539510379392">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We used descriptive analysis to evaluate the characteristics of the participants. We used the χ<sup>2</sup> test and the Student’s <italic>t</italic> test to calculate the mean values of the general characteristics. We then calculated the relative risk and the population attributable risk (PAR) to compare the differences between the 2 groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the incidence of breast cancer resulting from taking HRT. We searched for the most appropriate model to identify the significant variables using stepwise analysis, by setting breast cancer as the dependent factor. Following that reference, we analyzed the incidence of breast cancer with age, BMI, the age at menarche, parity, the age at first pregnancy, and HRT as independent factor using the Cox proportional hazard model. All significant values were defined by <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 as determined by SPSS in version 11.5 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>

The possible reason could be that the number of breast cancer diagnoses in the HRT group was initially lower than that in the placebo group, perhaps because the hormonal effects on breast tissue interfered with the interpretation of mammographic findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510379392">15</xref></sup> This is supported by Kelsey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510379392">16</xref></sup> who found similar results: the longer the period of hormonal exposure from menarche to menopause, the greater the risk of breast cancer. Also, there have been arguments related to the side effects from the long-term use of HRT supported by large and well-designed studies such as HERS (Heart and Estrogen Progestin Replacement Study, 1998), HERSII (2002), the WHI (Women’s Health Initiative) study (2002, 2004), and MWS (Million Women Study, 2003, 2005).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510379392">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510379392">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510379392">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510379392">20</xref></sup> After the initial report of a decrease in the incidence of breast cancer beginning in 2003,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510379392">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510379392">22</xref></sup> subsequent reports have largely supported a relation between the use of menopausal HRT and breast cancer rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379392">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510379392">26</xref></sup> but discordant results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510379392">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510379392">28</xref></sup> and controversy regarding causality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510379392">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510379392">30</xref></sup> remain. Finally, the WHI investigators reported that the increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of estrogen plus progestin declined markedly soon after discontinuation of combined hormone therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510379392">31</xref></sup> The overall results raise concerns about whether the use of HRT is appropriate for treatment purposes and suggest that the underlying risks should be considered.</p>
<p>Based on previous epidemiological studies assuming the relative risks of breast cancer, the following factors are known to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in Korea, in women older than 50: a family history of breast cancer, early age at menarche, late age at menopause, nulliparity, late age at first pregnancy, evasion of breast feeding, weight greater than 64 kg, or BMI greater than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510379392">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510379392">33</xref></sup> In the current study, BMI tended to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but only HRT was significantly increased in the model. A case-controlled study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510379392">34</xref></sup> was conducted to explore the effects of diet and other factors on breast cancer development in China and found that factors associated with increased risk of breast cancer included early age at menarche, late age at menopause, and late age at first birth. In addition, breast cancer was associated with obesity and increased intake of animal fats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539510379392">35</xref></sup> Reports showed a decrease in the death rates of breast cancer patients on HRT. This paradoxical phenomenon could be a result of the fact that the breast cancer was detected earlier through periodic screening examinations of HRT or because previous latent breast cancer may have developed as a reaction to long-term HRT use. Therefore, their clinical course was not critical, and the disease did not progress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539510379392">36</xref></sup> The first prospective, randomized, controlled study of combination HRT and breast cancer risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1010539510379392">37</xref></sup> found that women on HRT did not have an increased incidence of breast cancer. In contrast, a retrospective study reported an increased risk of breast cancer among combination estrogen–progestin users after 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1010539510379392">38</xref></sup> In addition, Anderson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1010539510379392">39</xref></sup> found a significant increase in breast cancer risk in the WHI trial overall after only 5.6 years of follow-up. It is in line with a notion that durations of prior hormone exposure may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer, as shown in our study. The development of breast cancer would differ based on the periods of HRT use and, thus, further longer-term follow-up studies are needed to compare the 2 groups.</p>
<p>Recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1010539510379392">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1010539510379392">41</xref></sup> have demonstrated that low-dose HRT is safe and effective in decreasing vasomotor symptoms, improving vaginal atrophy, protecting the endometrium, and preventing postmenopausal bone loss compared with the conventional dose of HRT. These findings suggest that low-dose HRT may improve the compliance rate because it causes minimal spotting and breast tenderness and there are fewer progestogen-related adverse effects; it may also be more effective than conventional-dose HRT in reducing the risk of breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1010539510379392">42</xref></sup> In this study, there was 1 reported case of breast cancer from the use of a lower dose of HRT, which was used for 2 months (from medical records). However, the development period of breast cancer was 2½ years after the use of HRT. Therefore, in this case, the use of HRT was not considered to have affected the development of breast cancer.</p>
<p>There are some limitations in this study. First, there are several missing variables, and all the risk factors for breast cancer were not investigated. Second, the total follow-up period was 6.6 years. Therefore, further long-term effects of HRT could not be observed. Third, we were unable to compare the differences between premenopausal and postmenopausal women to evaluate the risks of breast cancer. Finally, we did not analyze the risks of breast cancer according to the types of HRT used and the differing treatment periods. However, this is the first report that examined the risk of breast cancer from the use of HRT in Korean women.</p>
<p>In summary, the risk of breast cancer was not significantly different between the 2 groups in the 6-year population-based cohort follow-up study. On the other hand, the risk of breast cancer increased with the use of HRT when the risk factors were adjusted in the model. Low-dose HRT may be considered for reducing the risk of breast cancer.</p>

<abstract>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine the relation between narcissistic orientations (grandiose sense of self-importance, interpersonal exploitation, and narcissistic rage) and relational aggression (self-satisfactory and punishment type) and the mediating effects of guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression. The sample consisted of 240 5th-grade and 6th-grade students (10- to 12-years-old) from two public elementary schools and 307 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-grade students (12- to 15-years-old) from two public middle schools in Japan. Results of structural equation modeling demonstrated that narcissistic rage was positively associated with relational aggression (punishment type). Moreover, interpersonal exploitation was related to more relational aggression (self-satisfactory and punishment type); however, guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression mediated this association. Age and gender did not largely affect these effects. Social and developmental processes involving relational aggression, narcissistic orientations, and guilt feelings and perceived classroom norms were discussed.</p>

<p>Forms of aggression and experiences of peer victimization at schools have been considered as social and school problems for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143034311421433">Olweus, 1993</xref>). The literature has suggested that bullying (i.e. being aggressive toward and being victimized by peers) may be a social context providing both victims and aggressors a host of adverse social and school-related problems such as increases in suicidal ideation, mental disease, psychosomatic illness, and truancy in many cultures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311421433">Beane, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311421433">Crick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311421433">Hampel, Manhal, &amp; Hayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311421433">Klomek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143034311421433">Rigby, 1998</xref>), including non-Western cultures such as Japan (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311421433">Banzai, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies on childhood aggression have primarily focused on overt aggression in the form of physical harm such as hitting and kicking (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311421433">Bettencourt &amp; Miller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143034311421433">Rauste-von Wright, 1989</xref>). However, recent studies have suggested that relational aggression is conceptually and functionally different from physical aggression, and, thus, relational aggression has received increased attention in recent years. Relational aggression is defined as behaviors that inflict harm on others through the manipulation of relationships (i.e. relationships are used as the means to hurt peers) such as social exclusion, ignoring, and malicious rumor spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311421433">Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995</xref>). The present study examined the way by which children are engaged in relationally aggressive acts, and whether individual differences in specific personality traits and socio-cognitive patterns are associated with this developmental process. The results of this investigation will also help researchers to develop effective prevention and intervention programs. Although there is growing empirical evidence for relationaly aggressive individuals, various issues need to be addressed in more detail in order to design effective prevention programs to reduce relational aggression behaviour in school (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311421433">Card, Stucky, Sawalani &amp; Little, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311421433">Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311421433">Murray-Close, Ostrov, &amp; Crick, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Relational aggression was examined in the present study given that literature has indicated that relative to physical forms of aggression, relational forms of aggression are more common and more detrimental to social-psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143034311421433">Prinstein, Boegers, &amp; Vernberg, 2001</xref>). Especially in a culture in which members highly value relationships such as Japan, students show high depressive symptoms towards relational forms of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311421433">Crick, Ostrov, &amp; Kawabata, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311421433">Kawabata, Crick, &amp; Hamaguchi, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311421433">2010b</xref>). This is in line with the view that group membership (i.e. belonging to dyadic friendship and a larger peer group) is important for the continual survival of human beings, especially in a collectivistic society and, hence, ostracism inflicted by peer exclusion and rejection, which are typical features of relational aggression, may be especially harmful to children's mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311421433">Crystal, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>It is also noted that when one examines aggression and peer victimization, it is important to pay close attention to the effect of the larger social context such as schools and classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311421433">Graham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311421433">Juvonen, Nishina, &amp; Graham, 2006</xref>). Given that bullying often occurs within classrooms and both victims and the perpetrators typically display a wide array of social-psychological adjustment problems that are rooted in their negative relationships with classmates (e.g. peer rejection, depressive symptoms), it is important to investigate whether classrooms as a social context matter in the development of aggression. Finding the potential effect of classrooms also allows researchers to build effective classroom-based prevention and intervention programs that reduce levels of aggression. Additionally, it has been well documented that individuals with high levels of self-esteem or narcissism tend to exhibit (physically) aggressive behaviors, especially when they are threatened by others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311421433">Baumeister, Smart, &amp; Boden, 1996</xref>). Hence, these personality orientations may be a precursor of relational aggression. Accordingly, the present study addressed these issues in the literature and examined the mechanisms involving relational aggression, distinct personality traits (i.e. narcissism), and socio-cognitive patterns (i.e. guilt feeling toward and classroom norms against relational aggression) with a Japanese sample.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0143034311421433"><title>Relational aggression</title>
<p>Relational aggression has been examined throughout developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311421433">Crick et al., 1999</xref>). Relational aggression is conceptually different from physical aggression as it focuses on the manipulation and damage of relationships to hurt peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311421433">Crick et al., 1999</xref>). Relational aggression has to date been shown to be associated with a host of social-psychological adjustment problems, including peer rejection, externalizing adjustment problems (e.g. aggression, delinquency), and internalizing adjustment problems (e.g. social anxiety, loneliness, depressive symptoms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311421433">Crick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311421433">Crick, Casas, &amp; Mosher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311421433">Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143034311421433">Prinstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0143034311421433">Werner &amp; Crick, 1999</xref>). Further, research on social-information processing patterns involved in relational aggression has yielded valuable evidence of on-line cognitive and emotional processes that bring about relationally aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311421433">Crick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311421433">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311421433">Crick, Grotpeter, &amp; Bigbee, 2002</xref>). Recently, research on relational aggression has expanded into more diverse sub-domains such as developmental psychopathology and has examined the mechanisms by which relational aggression leads to forms of psychopathology (e.g. depression, borderline personality disorder; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311421433">Crick, Murray-Close, &amp; Woods, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Relational aggression has received international attention in recent years. As such, an extensive body of cross-cultrual studies have documented the existence of relational aggression (in addition to physical aggression) across nations, incluing Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311421433">Hayward &amp; Fletcher, 2003</xref>), United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311421433">Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143034311421433">Ostrov, Ries, Stauffacher, Godleski, &amp; Mullins, 2008</xref>), England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311421433">Coyne, Archer, &amp; Eslea, 2006</xref>), Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311421433">Hampel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0143034311421433">von Marees &amp; Petermann, 2010</xref>), Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421433">Andreou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311421433">Georgiou &amp; Stavrinides, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0143034311421433">Sapouna, 2008</xref>), Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0143034311421433">Tomada &amp; Schneider, 1997</xref>), Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311421433">Kawabata et al., 2010a</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311421433">2010b</xref>), South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311421433">Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0143034311421433">Yang, Kim, Kim, Shin, &amp; Yoon, 2006</xref>), and Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311421433">Cheng, 2009</xref>). For example, studies with a German sample found that physical aggression was more common than relational aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0143034311421433">von Marees &amp; Petermann, 2010</xref>) and both forms of aggression were associated with higher levels of social-psychological adjustment problems, including internalizing, externalizing, emotion control, and self-related problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311421433">Hampel et al., 2009</xref>). Another study with Greek elementary school children found that relational aggression only was linked to a high level of social intelligence that is indexed by a wide variety of social skills (i.e. to understand how other peers think, feel, and act; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311421433">Andreou, 2006</xref>). In South Korea, relationally aggressive boys were more likely to be rejected by peers, whereas relationally aggressive girls were both rejected and accepted by peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311421433">Lee, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies that examined relational aggression in Japanese school-aged children have demonstrated that relational aggression, which was conceptually different from physical aggression, was frequently used by children and more detrimental to their social-psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311421433">Kawabata et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311421433">2010b</xref>). These findings suggest that relational and physical aggression have somewhat different effects on social adjustment with peers, even with an international sample.</p>
<p>Previous studies that examined bullying, which includes ignoring, social exclusion, and verbal threat, have also demonstrated different types of relational aggression and bullying. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311421433">Inoue, Toda, and Nakamatsu (1986)</xref> conducted a study in which the authors asked school-aged children why they bully (or aggress toward) peers in questionnaires. Based on the factorial analysis of this study, three factors such as ‘Punishment bullying’, ‘Heterogeneity exclusion bullying’, and ‘Irrationality bullying’ emerged for using aggression as the tool to hurt peers. ‘Punishment bullying’ is sometimes called ‘bullying with justice’ because the perpetrators bully peers due to the victims’ faults. For instance, some peers view that the targeted child needs to be bullied (punished) by someone because they are always late for class or they often tell a lie to classmates. ‘Heterogeneity exclusion bullying’ is a type of bullying in which children who look different from other peers are bullied. This type of bullying aims to exclude children who often display a negative attitude that may ruin the harmony or tranquility of friendships and peer relationships. ‘Irrationality bullying’ is an arbitrary type of bullying in which the perpetrator bullies peers randomly to reduce his/her bad feeling. These types of bullying were examined in the present study because they seem to be common reasons why school-aged children and early adolescents are engaged in relationally aggressive acts (i.e. social exclusion, ignoring, spreading rumors). Although the majority of past studies, including those conducted in international settings, have indicated the type, frequency, and severity of relational aggression and bullying, these studies have not informed us about <italic>how and why</italic> children are engaged in a constellation of relationally aggressive acts. The present study was designed to address this issue.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0143034311421433"><title>Narcissistic orientations</title>
<p>A large body of research has demonstrated that narcissistic orientations are associated with the development of aggression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311421433">Barry, Packard, &amp; Ansel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311421433">Fite, Stoppelbein, &amp; Greening, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311421433">Lawrence, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143034311421433">Ostrowsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0143034311421433">Reidy, Zeichner, Foster, &amp; Martinez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143034311421433">Seah &amp; Ang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0143034311421433">Washburn, McMahon, King, Reinecke, &amp; Silver, 2004</xref>). According to DSM-IV, narcissists typically display self-aggrandisement and fantasies about their unlimited ability and power, and they often react with rage, shame, or humiliation when their self-esteem is threatened. This is in line with the threatened-egotism model of aggression, which has posited that individuals with a high level of narcissism are more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviors when they are threatened, and this model has been supported by multiple empirical studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311421433">Baumeister, Bushman, &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311421433">Baumeister et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311421433">Bushman &amp; Baumeister, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311421433">Fukushima, Iwasaki, Aoki, &amp; Kikuchi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311421433">Locke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311421433">Martinez, Zeichner, Reidy, &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0143034311421433">Papps &amp; O'Carroll, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0143034311421433">Stucke &amp; Sporer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0143034311421433">Thomaes, Bushman, Stegge, &amp; Olthof, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0143034311421433">Twenge &amp; Campbell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0143034311421433">Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, &amp; Jayawickreme, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, the majority of past studies have primarily focused on externalizing problems as consequences of the threatened narcissists. Hence, relatively little is known concerning whether narcissism predicts a more indirect, subtle form of aggression such as relational aggression.</p>
<p>Although premature, several studies with an adolescent sample concluded that narcissism was associated with greater levels of relational aggression. For example, studies which examined the association between specific personality traits such as narcissism and relational aggression in a sample of at-risk adolescents revealed that maladaptive narcissism was associated with more relational aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311421433">Barry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311421433">Golmaryami &amp; Barry, 2010</xref>). Another study found that narcissism predicted relational aggression in a subsample of adolescents with high levels of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311421433">Golmaryami &amp; Barry, 2010</xref>). These findings are reasonable given that behaviors that narcissists typically display are similar to features of relational aggression. For example, adolescents with high levels of interpersonal exploitation typically use friends for their own sake without feeling guilty or choose friends that they can exploit to gain benefits from them. In turn, some relationally aggressive individuals use relationships to obtain high social status over other peers (i.e. to achieve dominance and popularity). Moreover, narcissists, in theory, often get angry, mad, and upset about peers when they are treated by others disrespectfully. Likewise, individuals who display relational aggression, relative to others who do not use relational aggression, are more likely to exhibit hostile attributional biases and emotional distress (i.e. feelings of upset) for relational peer provocations, including slight, snub, and rebuff by peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311421433">Crick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311421433">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311421433">Crick et al., 2002</xref>). Given these similarities, it is conceivable that threatened narcissism may be a risk factor for relational aggression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143034311421433"><title>Perceived classroom norms</title>
<p>Relational aggression often involves multiple peers and typically occurs within classrooms. Recent studies of aggression/bullying have suggested that in addition to aggressors, bystanders who surround the victim(s) influence the behavior of the perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311421433">Atlas &amp; Pepler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311421433">Gini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311421433">Morita &amp; Kiyonaga, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143034311421433">Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Österman, &amp; Kaukiainen, 1996</xref>). Thus, it is crucial to examine a classroom as a context in which aggressors and bystanders may be jointly engaged in bullying behaviors. In fact, several theories concerning individuals-social context relations stress the importance of taking into account the function of normative behavior in the particular context. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0143034311421433">Stormshak et al. (1999)</xref> proposed The Person-Group Similarity Model, which posits that individuals in the particular group context are inclined to behave and act according to the normative way. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143034311421433">Onishi (2007)</xref> has examined the link between the classroom norms and students’ inclination to be aggressive toward peers at Japanese middle schools. The results showed that relative to peers who were in a relatively lower level of bullying-denial norms, students were more likely to be involved in bullying behaviors in the classroom with a relatively higher level of bullying-denial norms. This finding suggested that classroom norms for supporting or denying bullying behaviors may influence children's tendency to be aggressive toward other peers. Hence, it is conceivable that relative to peers who are in classrooms associated with high levels of bullying-denial norms, children who are in classrooms with a relatively lower level of bullying-denial norms may be more likely to support aggressive acts and, thus, may be more likely to use relational aggression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034311421433"><title>Guilt feelings</title>
<p>In the present study, guilt feelings, which may covary with classroom norms, are examined as a factor that may influence children's tendency for relational aggression via classroom norms that deny bullying (aggression and peer victimization). Some studies have indicated that guilt feelings promote prosocial behavior and inhibit aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311421433">Hoffman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0143034311421433">Tangney, 1995</xref>). Guilt feelings are defined as ‘affection to make excuse and apology to correct bad influence on others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311421433">Hisazaki, 2005</xref>). Guilt feelings occur when one's own act is negatively evaluated by and elicits the concerns about the negative influence of own act that may exert on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311421433">Hisazaki, 2005</xref>). Previous studies of guilt have found that there is a positive relation between guilt feelings and sympathy, and there is a negative relation between guilt feelings and self-regulation of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311421433">Arimitsu, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311421433">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311421433">Ishikawa &amp; Uchiyama, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311421433">Mancini and Gangemi (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143034311421433">2006</xref>) have suggested that individuals who strongly anticipate guilt (or have guilt feelings toward something wrong) tend to fear the possession of guilt feelings and, thus, take precautions to avoid such negative feelings. This suggests that feeling guilt and fear for the violation of wrongfulness may prevent children from being engaged in aggressive or bullying behaviors. Because these children need to avoid distress or negative emotions elicited from feeling guilt, they may not be engaged in a constellation of aggressive acts. Thus, it is possible that the anticipation of guilt (i.e. having guilt feelings) predicts less relational aggression.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0143034311421433"><title>The present study</title>
<p>The present study examined the relations between narcissistic orientations and two purposes of relational aggression (i.e. self-satisfactory and punishment type) and whether perceived classroom norms and guilt feelings mediate these relations. Based on our literature review, it was hypothesized that 1) narcissistic orientations would be positively related to relational aggression; and 2) guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression would mediate this association, such that narcissistic orientations would be negatively associated with these mediators (i.e. higher levels of guilt feelings and anti-bullying classroom norms), which in turn would be inversely related to relational aggression. Age and gender differences were also examined. It appears that no study has explicitly examined the role of narcissistic orientations in relational aggression and the mediating effects of guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression in middle childhood and early adolescence.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0143034311421433" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 240 5th-grade and 6th-grade children (119 boys, 121 girls; 10- to 12-years-old) from eight classrooms in two public elementary schools and 307 adolescents (143 males, 164 females; 12- to 15-years-old) from ten classrooms in two public junior high schools. All schools were located in the suburbs of Mie prefecture in Japan. Participants’ socio-economic status was estimated to be lower middle to middle class based on demographic information of the schools (i.e. the percentage of students who received financial support from government was 0.4% ∼ 0.8%). Because it is not a standard procedure in Japan, we did not obtain consent forms from children's parents when performing research in the schools in the country. In fact, Japanese schools act <italic>in loco parentis</italic>, thus we were not allowed to obtain consent forms from parents. We therefore strictly followed this practice in order to be culturally appropriate in our interactions with the schools and their students. In doing so, we fully discussed the detailed procedure of conducting research and issues of confidentiality and protection of human rights with the classroom teachers and school principals before collecting the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0143034311421433" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data were collected from June to September 2007. Children and adolescents were asked to complete a series of questionnaires regarding relational bullying, narcissistic orientations, the likelihood of feeling guilty for relational bullying, as well as perceived classroom norms regarding relational bullying. Children and adolescents were informed that their participation in the study was completely voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. They were also informed that all responses would be confidential and would in no way impact their grades.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0143034311421433"><title>Relational aggression and guilty feelings toward relational aggression</title>
<p>A hypothetical-situation instrument based on past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311421433">Inoue et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143034311421433">Onishi, Kurokawa, &amp; Yoshida, 2009</xref>) was used to assess relational aggression. This instrument consisted of 12 situations (four scenarios of relational aggression × three types of purposes). The three types of purposes for relational aggression included a self-satisfaction/fun type and a punishment type. Children and adolescents were asked to respond to two questions for each situation. In the first question, children and adolescents were asked about relational aggression (‘If you were the main character of the story, do you participate in the relational bullying?’). The response scale ranged from 1 (Never) to 4 (Always). In the second question, children and adolescents were asked about the likelihood of feeling guilty (i.e. guilt feelings) for relational aggression (‘If you participated in the relational bullying, do you think that you will feel guilty?’). The response scale ranged from 1 (Never) to 5 (Strongly). The scores ranged from 6–24, from 5–20, and from 12–48, for the self-satisfaction/fun type, the punishment type, and guilt feelings, respectively. The score for each scenario was summed to generate the total scores of two types of relational aggression and guilt feelings.</p>
<p>For the current sample, a principal-axis factor analysis was performed and two factors were extracted for relational bullying (self-satisfaction/fun purpose and punishment purpose, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143034311421433">Onishi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0143034311421433">Appendix B</xref>), which was different from the previous research conducted in Japan in the 1980s (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311421433">Inoue et al., 1986</xref>). Attenuation of the eigenvalues is 6.51, 1.21, 0.70, 0.60, … . Because of the low standard factor loading (0.35 or below), one item was removed from the analysis. A principal-axis factor analysis was also performed for the likelihood of feeling guilty for relational aggression and one factor was extracted (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143034311421433">Onishi et al., 2009</xref>). Attenuation of the eigenvalues is 7.00, 1.13, 0.68, … . Moreover, computation of Cronbach's alpha demonstrated that both scales (i.e. two purposes of relational bullying and guilt feelings) were internally consistent for the samples, α = 0.88, 0.87, and 0.93 for the self-satisfaction/fun purpose, the punishment purpose, and the likelihood of feeling guilty, respectively.

<sec id="sec13-0143034311421433"><title>Perceived classroom norms</title>
<p>Perceived classroom norms concerning relational bullying were assessed using the Classroom Norms Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143034311421433">Onishi, 2007</xref>). This instrument consisted of eight items. For each item, children and students were asked to choose how their classmates would judge the behavior corresponding to relational bullying. The response scale ranged from 1 (very appropriate) to 7 (very inappropriate). For the current sample, a principal-axis factor analysis was performed and one factor was extracted for perceived classroom norms about relational bullying. Attenuation of the eigenvalues is 4.07, 1.03, 0.63. The Classroom Norms Scale displayed high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.87). The score ranged from 7–49 for the perceived classroom norms about relational bullying. The score for each item was summed to generate the total scores of perceived classroom norms about relational bullying (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143034311421433">Onishi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0143034311421433">Appendix B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec14-0143034311421433"><title>Narcissistic orientations</title>
<p>Narcissistic orientations were assessed using the Japanese version of the Narcisstic Personality Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311421433">Aizawa, 2002</xref>). This scale was adopted from the Narcisstic Personality Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0143034311421433">Raskin &amp; Hall, 1979</xref>), Personality Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143034311421433">Murray, 1938</xref>), and O'Brien Multiphasic Narcissism Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311421433">Mullins &amp; Kopelman, 1988</xref>). This instrument consisted of 23 items. Twelve items with a low factor loading (below 0.40) were not used to lighten the work load of the children and the students. For each item, children and students were asked to choose which statement most closely resembled their thoughts and feelings. The response scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). For the current sample, a principal-axis factor analysis was performed and four factors were extracted for narcissistic orientations (grandiose sense of self-importance, interpersonally exploitative, desire for attention, and narcissistic rage). Attenuation of the eigenvalues is 3.79, 1.58, 1.23, 1.06, for each subscale, respectively. In the present sample, computation of Cronbach's α demonstrated acceptable internal consistent, α = 0.80, 0.74, 0.71, and 0.67, for the grandiose sense of self-importance, the interpersonally exploitative, the desire for attention, and the narcissistic rage, respectively. The scores ranged from 4–20, from 3–15, from 2–10, and from 2–10, for the grandiose sense of self-importance, interpersonally exploitative, desire for attention, and narcissistic rage, respectively. The score for each item of four factors was summed to generate the total scores for each subscale of narcissistic orientations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143034311421433">Onishi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0143034311421433">Appendix B</xref>).</p>

<p>A MANOVA was conducted to examine the frequency of two types of relational aggression, perceived classroom norms, guilt feelings for relational aggression and four subscales of narcissistic orientations. Grade (0 = elementary school, 1 = middle school) and gender (0 = male, 1 = female) served as independent variables, and two types of relational aggression, perceived classroom norms, guilt feelings for relational aggression, and four subscales of narcissistic orientations served as dependent variables. Multivariate tests indicated a significant main effect of grade for relational aggression––self-satisfactory type (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 66.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), relational aggression––punishment type (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 44.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), perceived classroom norms (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 26.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), guilt feelings for relational aggression (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 9.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and grandiose sense of self-importance (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 4.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Multivariate tests also indicated a significant main effect of gender for guilt feelings for relational aggression (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 15.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), grandiose sense of self-importance (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 7.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and interpersonal exploitation (<italic>F</italic> (1,543) = 6.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These findings indicate that relative to elementary school children, early adolescents displayed greater levels of relational aggression (both self-satisfactory type and punishment type). Concurrently, relative to elementary school children, early adolescents exhibited lower levels of guilt feelings toward relational aggression, lower levels of perceived classroom norms against relational aggression, and lower levels of grandiose sense of self-importance. Further, girls were more likely to feel guilty about using relational aggression than boys, whereas boys were more likely to exhibit grandiose sense of self-importance and interpersonal exploitation than girls.</p>

<p>Pearson product-moment correlations among variables along with Means and Standard Deviations of the variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034311421433">Table 1</xref>. The results showed that there were small to moderate correlations among main variables.

These findings were the basis of subsequent structural equation model (SEM) analysis. It is noted that one of the subscales for narcissistic orientations––desire for attention was excluded from subsequent SEM analysis because it was not significantly correlated with key variables such as guilt feelings for relational aggression, perceived classroom norms against relational aggression, and two types of relational aggression.

<sec id="sec18-0143034311421433"><title>Effects of narcissistic orientations, classroom norms, and guilt feelings on relational aggression</title>
<p>To examine the association between three subscales of narcissistic orientations and relational aggression (a self-satisfactory type and a punishment type), and the mediational effects of guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression in this association, structural equation modeling (multi-group analysis) was conducted using Amos 7.0. The results of the multi-group analyses showed that the model fit equally well for school-aged children (5th and 6th graders) and early adolescents (7th to 9th graders), GFI = 0.983, AGFI = 0.941, CFI = 0.980, RMSEA = 0.045 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311421433">Figure 1</xref>). The overall pattern of results generally supported our hypotheses. That is, greater levels of narcissistic orientations such as interpersonal exploitation and narcissistic rage were associated with more relational aggression (both self-satisfactory type and punishment type); however, this association was mediated by perceived classroom norms against and guilt feelings toward relational aggression. For example, interpersonal exploitation was negatively related to perceived classroom norms against and guilt feelings toward relational aggression, which were in turn related to less relational aggression (both self-satisfactory type and punishment type). Interestingly, narcissistic rage was directly associated with more relational aggression (only punishment type).
<fig id="fig1-0143034311421433" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A mediating model of relational aggression, narcissistic orientations, guilt feelings, and perceived classroom norms for school-aged children and early adolescents.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143034311421433-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Further, age and gender differences in each path of the model were tested, imposing each path to be equal for school-aged children and early adolescents or for boys and girls. The results showed that no path was significantly different for boys and girls and for school-aged children and adolescents except for one path (i.e. a path from interpersonal exploitation to perceived classroom norms against relational aggression, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311421433">Figure 1</xref>). That is, the relation between interpersonal exploitation and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression was stronger for early adolescents than for school-aged children (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311421433">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec19-0143034311421433" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine the relation between narcissistic orientations and relational aggression (self-satisfactory and punishment type) and the mediating effects of guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression. The present study demonstrated that narcissistic rage was positively associated with relational aggression (punishment type). Moreover, interpersonal exploitation was related to more relational aggression (self-satisfactory and punishment type); however, guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression mediated this association. Age and gender did not largely affect these effects. These findings suggest that having higher levels of guilt feelings toward and perceived classroom norms against relational aggression may explain why some children, regardless of whether they are boys or girls, who exhibit narcissistic orientations are less likely to be relationally aggressive toward peers in particular classrooms.</p>
<sec id="sec20-0143034311421433"><title>The association between narcissistic orientations and relational aggression</title>
<p>The present study demonstrated, as hypothesized, that narcissistic orientations (grandiose sense of self-importance, interpersonally exploitative, and narcissistic rage) were associated with more relational aggression (both self-satisfactory and punishment type). Similar to the findings of past studies that showed that high self-esteem or narcissism are related to more aggression (i.e. externalizing problems such as physical aggression, delinquency, violence, and antisocial behavior), the present study confirmed the link between such personality traits and relational aggression. Along with the findings of Western studies that examined this link (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311421433">Golmaryami &amp; Barry, 2010</xref>), the findings of the present study indicated that Japanese adolescents with high levels of narcissistic orientations may be more likely to use relational aggression compared to other peers. The mechanisms behind this link may be that adolescents with high levels of self-esteem or narcissistic orientations such as interpersonal exploitation may use relationships as the means to gain high social status or popularity among peers, which is developmentally crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311421433">Cillessen &amp; Mayeux, 2007</xref>). Further, given that adolescents who display relational aggression exhibit hostile attributional biases and emotional distress (i.e. feeling of upset) for relational peer provocations, including possible interpersonal threat (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311421433">Crick, 1995</xref>), it is possible that they may view that they are threatened by peers (i.e. they are intentionally ignored, excluded, or treated as invisible by peers) in such a provocative context. This notion is in line with the threatened-egotism model of aggression, which posits that narcissistic individuals often react with anger when their self-esteem is threatened. Taken together, it is conceivable that adolescents with higher levels of narcissistic orientations are more likely to use relational aggression particularly because they feel that they are threatened by peers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0143034311421433"><title>Mediating roles of perceived classroom norms and guilt feeling</title>
<p>The present study further showed that perceived classroom norms against and guilt feeling toward relational aggression mediated the association between narcissistic orientations and relational aggression. Of the three types of narcissistic orientations aforementioned above, interpersonal exploitation was shown to be most strongly related to relational aggression via perceived classroom norms against and guilt feeling toward relational aggression. That is, children who were more interpersonally exploitative exhibited lower perceived classroom norms against and guilt feelings for relational aggression and, thus, use more relational aggression. One possibility is that these children may have a tendency to view that peers should act in accordance with their own expectations, and in turn, this way of thinking may reduce their prosocial orientations toward peers. It is also noted that whereas narcissistic rage was weakly associated with relational aggression (punishment type), other narcissistic orientations were not directly related to relational aggression. These findings suggest that relational aggression may be not only impulsive behavior but also behavior that is influenced by environmental factors such as classroom normative beliefs about relational aggression.</p>
<p>These findings are in line with the results of past studies that have indicated that having a stronger perception of classroom norms against relational aggression reduces the potential for participation in relational aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143034311421433">Onishi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311421433">Onishi &amp; Yoshida, 2010</xref>). It has been widely documented that friendships and peer relationships are important factors that influence children's social and school adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311421433">Hartup &amp; Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143034311421433">Okubo, 2005</xref>). In turn, Japanese children are expected to behave and form harmonious relationships with peers in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143034311421433">Rothbaum, Pott, Azuma, Miyake, &amp; Weisz, 2000</xref>). Given that children who exhibit aggressive behavior may transgress the group norms of the classroom (i.e. the harmony of relationships) and may be criticized by other peers, the cost of engaging in such aggressive acts may be high. Thus, children in classrooms associated with high levels of harmony may not use aggressive strategies such as relational aggression for fear of its high cost. By contrast, children in classrooms that tolerate aggressive behavior, may conform to the classroom norms (i.e. using aggressive behavior) and, thus, behave in the same way as the other peers do.</p>
<p>Further, the present study found that the strength of the association between classroom norms against relational aggression and a satisfactory type of relational aggression was larger than the magnitude of the relation between classroom norms against relational aggression and a punishment type of relational aggression. One possibility is that the self-satisfactory type of relational aggression may be more likely to be perceived by classmates as negative and so is more likely to be affected by classroom norms against relational aggression. If classroom norms are used as a means to prevent relational aggression, it may be possible to build prevention and intervention programs to promote anti-bullying norms and reduce such insidious bullying behaviors which teachers often cannot detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311421433">Mishna, Wiener, &amp; Pepler, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared to other factors, guilt feelings for relational aggression have the strongest impact on potential participation in relational aggression (self-satisfactory and punishment type). Guilt is a very uncomfortable emotion of contempt towards oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311421433">Hoffman, 1998</xref>). Thus, children who expect to have guilt feelings toward relational aggression attempt to avoid such an uncomfortable affective state. For example, when these children have conflicts with their friends, they may turn off negative emotions that may be caused by such interpersonal problems and may avert using hostile behaviors such as relational aggression. This is in line with the view that guilt feelings have the function of motivating the bully to confess and apologise for their bad behavior and attempt to make up for it rather than withdraw from other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0143034311421433">Tangney, Burggraf, &amp; Wagner, 1995</xref>). Therefore, we can expect that if the perpetrator of relational aggression has guilt feelings for aggressing toward peers, he/she may think that his/her behavior is wrong and may stop such aggressive behavior eventually. This kind of prosocial function generated by having guilt feelings is effective at preventing the development and maintenance of aggressive behavior. Given that bullying and aggressive behavior are widespread and often escalate to severe violent behavior throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311421433">Berthold &amp; Hoover, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311421433">Chen &amp; Astor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0143034311421433">Wei, Jonson-Reid, &amp; Tsao, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0143034311421433">Yoneyama &amp; Naito, 2003</xref>), it is important to create prosocial classroom norms (thereby having guilt feelings toward relational aggression) that may increase children's prosocial behavior and reduce relational aggression.</p>

<sec id="sec22-0143034311421433"><title>Future implications</title>
<p>The present study offers guidance for future studies that examine relational aggression. Although the present study revealed that narcissistic orientations were associated with relational aggression, a cross-sectional study such as the present study makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding long-term consequences of such personality orientations. Based on the findings of the present study, it is plausible that adolescents with high levels of narcissistic orientations would be more likely to be relationally aggressive toward peers over time. Further, the present study and all studies, which are correlational in nature, do not allow us to determine the directionality in the relation between narcissistic orientations and relational aggression. Whereas narcissistic orientations may be a precursor of relational aggression, such personality orientations may be the consequence. Thus, an extended longitudinal study is warranted to test these premises.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0143034311421433"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>One of the limitations of this study is the issue of sample representativeness and generalizability of the findings. Whereas the sample included a large range of age groups, the data may not be necessarily generalized to all children and adolescents in Japan. Another limitation of this study is the lack of specific information on social contexts, including the child's specific SES, neighborhood, and family. Variables associating with these social contexts other than classrooms may co-vary with children's personality orientations and relational aggression (e.g. parental educational levels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0143034311421433">von Marees &amp; Petermann, 2010</xref>, parenting behaviours and teacher-child relationships; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0143034311421433">Shin &amp; Kim, 2008</xref>). An alternative limitation may stem from the methodology we used. Although the validity and reliability of self-reported measures are well established, using self-reports only leads to shared method variance, which may inflate the estimates of the paths tested in the model. Further, the lack of obtaining peer reports of aggression would limit the applicability of the findings. In fact, peer nomination procedures have been extremely difficult, if not impossible to use in Japanese schools, because most Japanese teachers, school principals, and educators are opposed to this kind of method. Alternative methods such as face-to-face interviews, naturalistic observations, and behavioral diaries may be used to uncover the details of cross-cultural differences and similarities in aggression and adjustment. Accordingly, in future studies, it would be important to replicate the findings of the present study using diverse methodologies. Despite these limitations, the present study, drawing upon a relatively large, non-Western sample, helps bridge the gaps in the literature by demonstrating that adolescents who display higher levels of narcissistic orientations may be more likely to be relationally aggressive; however, these developmental processes may be accounted for by the degree to which they feel guilty toward relational aggression and perceive that the norm of classrooms are more or less anti-bullying.</p>

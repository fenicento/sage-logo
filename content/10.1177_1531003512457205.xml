<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors present an analysis of the outcomes of 105 low-flow vascular malformation patients treated over a 6-year period and report specific lesion characteristics that correlate with those vascular malformations that will benefit from sodium tetradecyl sulfate foam sclerotherapy (STS FS) versus surgical resection as well as morphological characteristics of vascular malformations that are associated with a poor response to FS treatment. Improvement in symptoms was documented in 92.9% of patients treated with STS FS. There were no complications. Low-flow vascular malformations that were morphologically characterized by microcystic, septated vessels did not respond to FS, and these vascular malformations are best treated with surgical resection. Primary surgical resection is also the treatment of choice for localized, microcystic, and superficial low-flow vascular malformations. Symptomatic, diffuse, extensive, macrocystic malformations that involve multiple tissue planes and vital structures are best treated with FS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low-flow vascular malformations (LFVM) are rare, embryologically developed errors in vascular morphogenesis of unknown etiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1531003512457205">1</xref></sup> Although genetic aberrations are suspected to be the underlying etiology, the exact molecular mechanism responsible for development of LFVM still remains to be elucidated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512457205">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512457205"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512457205"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1531003512457205"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1531003512457205">7</xref></sup> The majority of LFVMs occur as sporadic lesions, but in rare cases (1%-2%), they are familial, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1531003512457205">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1531003512457205">10</xref></sup> With an estimated incidence of 0.8% to 1%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1531003512457205">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1531003512457205">12</xref></sup> venous malformations (VMs) are the most common type, and they comprise approximately two thirds of all congenital vascular malformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1531003512457205">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1531003512457205">14</xref></sup> Despite distinct clinical, radiological, and histological characteristics, LFVMs are frequently confused with vascular tumors (most often with infantile hemangiomas) and high-flow vascular malformations (HFVMs) because of lack of familiarity with existing classification systems.</p>
<p>In addition to diagnostic challenges, the management of LFVMs is often complex. Although surgical resection and sclerotherapy of LFVMs are the standard of care, both treatment modalities are associated with limitations and major side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1531003512457205">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1531003512457205"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1531003512457205"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1531003512457205"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1531003512457205">20</xref></sup> Surgical resection can be complicated by a high incidence of recurrence and is indicated only in small, superficial, microcystic malformations. Extensive resection is relatively contraindicated for diffuse and infiltrating lesions because it may result in considerable morbidity (loss of physiological functions, nerve injuries, and extensive bleeding and scarring). Sclerotherapy represents the less-invasive alternative to surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1531003512457205">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1531003512457205">23</xref></sup> Numerous sclerosing agents have been developed, but none have been determined to be superior in terms of efficacy or safety in treating LFVMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1531003512457205">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1531003512457205">26</xref></sup> Historically, the treatment of choice has been absolute alcohol (ethanol).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1531003512457205">27</xref></sup> Ethanol sclerotherapy (ES) has been proven to be relatively effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1531003512457205">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1531003512457205">30</xref></sup> but has fallen out of favor with many specialists because of its morbidity profile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1531003512457205">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1531003512457205">32</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Given the surgical limitations and major side effects associated with ethanol, our group uses ultrasound (US)- or fluoroscopically guided sodium tetradecyl sulfate foam sclerotherapy (STS FS) as the first line of treatment for LFVMs. Most of the published studies discussing STS FS are limited by short-term follow-up data and a relatively small number of evaluated patients and are largely based on the management of LFVM by a single specialty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1531003512457205">33</xref></sup> The objective of the current study is to determine whether STS FS is safe and effective in the treatment of LFVMs, to identify lesions that are most amenable for STS FS treatment, and to determine lesion characteristics that positively influence the outcomes of treatment.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Over a 72-month period, we prospectively followed patients treated for symptomatic congenital vascular malformation at Duke University Medical Center. Patient evaluations and indications for treatment were based on the assessments of our multidisciplinary vascular malformation team, which was composed of representatives from the following departments: vascular surgery, plastic surgery, pediatric surgery, diagnostic radiology, interventional radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology. Data regarding baseline characteristics of patients, type and location of malformation, symptoms, diagnostic modalities, indications for treatment, type of treatment, operative data, outcomes, and complications were prospectively collected and entered into a database that formed the basis for this study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1531003512457205">
<title>Preoperative Evaluation and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>After taking a detailed medical history and performing a complete physical examination, each patient underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dceMRI) to determine flow characteristics (high flow versus low flow) and extent of the lesion. A detailed description of our diagnostic algorithm, including the dceMRI protocol, technique, and criterion, for distinguishing HFVM from LFVM was previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1531003512457205">35</xref></sup> Patients with vascular tumors and HFVM were excluded from the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1531003512457205">
<title>Operative Details</title>
<p>Early in the study, patients were treated either by ES or surgical resection. ES was subsequently replaced by STS and polidocanol FS (after polidocanol FDA approval; March, 2010). All STS FS procedures were performed in the outpatient clinic, under minimal or no sedation, except in pediatric patients, where procedures were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia to ensure adequate compliance. Foam was produced by the Tessari technique of mixing, using 2 syringes and a plastic connector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1531003512457205">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1531003512457205">Figure 1</xref>). The sclerosant used was a mixture of STS (Sotradecol, Bioniche Pharma USA Inc, Belleville, Canada) and room air. The STS concentration was 0.5% to 1% and was adjusted for each patient individually. The maximum amount of the STS per treatment session did not exceed 5 mL (liquid solution). Prior to percutaneous cannulation and foam injection, patients were placed in the supine position, and malformations were examined for optimal access site. Procedures were performed under either visual guidance or US guidance (Titan, SonoSite Inc, Bothell, WA). Vascular access for visible, subdermal malformations was gained under direct visual guidance using a #25 butterfly needle. US guidance was used when deep access was required, as determined by the anatomy and the location of the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1531003512457205">Figure 2</xref>). Careful US monitoring, complete visualization of the entry needle at all times, and gentle blood aspiration with a syringe ensured intravascular positioning of the needle and intravascular administration of the sclerosant without extravasation into the surrounding tissue. Manual compression was applied to treated areas and areas proximal to the injection site, concurrent with foam injections, to decrease venous flow and to ensure maximal contact between STS and the endothelial lining of the malformation. If the malformation was located in an extremity, the affected extremity was kept elevated at a 45° angle for an additional 10 minutes after the STS injection to achieve more effective endoluminal obliteration. Light manual compression was applied at the puncture sites after needle removal to facilitate hemostasis and to prevent leak of the sclerosant. After completion of treatment, US was used to assess the outcome of the treatment session, and compression dressings were applied to treated areas to promote endosclerosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1531003512457205">Figure 3</xref>). Patients were instructed to keep multilayer compression dressings on for 1 week. Oral analgesics were recommended for the control of pain on discharge.</p>

<title>Outcome Assessment</title>
<p>Because most LFVMs cannot be completely cured, goals of therapy were determined by both the patient and primary treating team physician at the time of initial evaluation. Successful accomplishment of these goals was used as the criterion for completion of treatment. Patients were informed that, in most cases, multiple treatment sessions (usually at bimonthly intervals) would be required to achieve preset goals. They were asked to rank their estimation of how well preset goals were achieved and to grade their improvement in the symptoms for which they sought the treatment (ie, pain reduction, cosmetic improvement, and functional improvement). Based on these criteria, an outcomes grading system (1 = <italic>worse</italic>, 2 = <italic>no change</italic>, 3 = <italic>significant improvement</italic>, 4 = <italic>complete resolution</italic>) was applied to each patient.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 45 (42.9%) male and 60 (57.1%) female patients ranging in age from 1 to 68 years (mean ± standard deviation [SD] = 23.5 ± 16.4 years) were treated for LFVM. Patient characteristics and demographics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1531003512457205">Table 1</xref>. The most commonly affected site was the lower extremity (49.5%), followed by cephalocervical (21.9%), upper extremity (11.4%), and truncal (10.5%) locations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1531003512457205">Table 2</xref>). It was found that 7 malformations (6.7%) were diffuse and involved 2 or more of the above-mentioned anatomical locations. VMs and lymphatic malformations (LMs) affected 86 (71.9%) and 19 (18.1%) of the patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1531003512457205">Table 3</xref>). In the VM subgroup, in 14 (13.3%) patients, VM was associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), and in 2 (1.9%) patients, VM was associated with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. The most common indications for invasive management (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1531003512457205">Table 3</xref>) were swelling (78.1%), pain (69.5%), and functional impairment (35.2%). In all, 9 patients (8.6%) had had bleeding episodes in the past from the malformation.</p>

<p>In all, 28 (26.5%) LFVM patients underwent 154 FS treatments with STS. The mean number of treatments was 3.7 ± 4.1 (mean ± SD), ranging from 1 to 12 treatment sessions per patient. Improvement in symptoms was seen in 26 of 28 (92.9%) patients treated with STS FS. Among responders, complete resolution of symptoms was observed in 7 of 28 (25%) patients, 6 of whom had isolated VMs and 1 of whom carried the diagnosis of KTS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1531003512457205">Table 4</xref>). The majority of patients experienced improvement after the first session with STS FS. Only 2 patients (7.1%) did not respond to STS FS. These patients underwent successful surgical excision of the malformation. Polidocanol was used in 3 (2.9%) of the patients. All patients responded to polidocanol sclerotherapy. Two patients (66.7%) had significant improvement of symptoms, and 1 patient (33.3%) had complete resolution of symptoms. No complications associated with STS FS or polidocanol occurred during the study period.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we present an analysis of the outcomes of a large cohort of LFVM patients treated over a 6 year period. In addition, we report specific lesion characteristics that correlate with which LFVMs will benefit from STS FS versus surgical resection as well as morphological characteristics of LFVMs that are associated with a poor response to STS FS treatment.</p>
<p>The importance of a multidisciplinary team approach to the treatment of vascular malformations has been well established because correct diagnosis and management is often challenging as a result of the complex and rare nature of these disorders, which may require the expertise of a variety of specialists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1531003512457205">35</xref></sup> In this study, the 2 major goals of diagnostic evaluation of patients with vascular malformations were to differentiate LFVM from HFVM and vascular tumors and to determine the extent of lesion and involvement of vital structures. Although clinical evaluation was an important initial diagnostic step, it was not sufficient for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning because it often underestimated the involvement of deep structures (such as muscles, bones, joints, or abdominal viscera) and was not sufficient to differentiate HFVM from LFVM and malformations from hemangiomas in some of the more complex cases. Therefore, evaluation by MRI was used for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1531003512457205">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1531003512457205">38</xref></sup> Classically, LFVM demonstrated a high T2-weighted signal, whereas high-flow lesions demonstrated low signal regions, known as flow voids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1531003512457205">39</xref></sup> Differentiation between VMs and LMs was achieved with contrast-enhanced imaging with gadolinium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1531003512457205">Figure 4</xref>). VMs typically demonstrated intraluminal enhancement during the venous phase of imaging, whereas LMs demonstrated only peripheral enhancement and minimal (if any) diffuse enhancement. Time-resolved MR angiography, where images are acquired sequentially every few seconds, was used to provide additional dynamic flow-related information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1531003512457205">40</xref></sup> Not only can they assist in categorizing lesions as high flow versus low flow, but the source vessels can sometimes be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1531003512457205">Figure 5</xref>). We recently reported our experience with dceMRI in patients with vascular malformations and reported an accuracy of 83.8% with regard to differentiating between HFVMs and LFVMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1531003512457205">41</xref></sup> In contrast, static MRI provides useful anatomical data but no hemodynamic characteristics. In 2012, Mostardi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1531003512457205">42</xref></sup> demonstrated that Cartesian acquisition with projection-reconstruction like sampling (CAPR time-resolved imaging) was able to accurately differentiate LFVMs from HFVMs in a small series of patients with vascular malformations. The authors of this study also suggested that delayed imaging should be used to capture complete filling of very slow LFVMs. In inconclusive cases, when suspicion of arterial flow was based on MRI findings or when MRI could not exclude the presence of a high-flow component, patients received an arteriogram.</p>

<p>From a diagnostic standpoint, evaluation of the deep venous system deserves special consideration. In a study of 392 patients with congenital vascular malformations, Eifert et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1531003512457205">11</xref></sup> documented that 8% of VM patients (with venous predominance) had aplasia or hypoplasia of deep venous trunks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1531003512457205">11</xref></sup> It has also been documented that the prevalence of deep venous anomalies is even higher (18%) in patients with KTS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1531003512457205">43</xref></sup> In our cohort of patients, evaluation of patency and anatomical variations of the entire venous system (deep and superficial) was performed in all patients prior to establishing a definite treatment plan. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1531003512457205">Figure 6</xref> illustrates absent left common iliac vein in a patient who presented with suprapubic vascular malformation. In these patients, venous blood flow from the affected extremity depends on superficial and abnormal vessels, and treatment of the malformation carries the risk of the impairment of venous return from the affected extremity.</p>

<p>Since its introduction, sclerotherapy has been widely used as an alternative to surgery, and numerous sclerosants have been used in the treatment of LFVM. Historically, ethanol has been described as a potent and widely used sclerosant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1531003512457205">44</xref></sup> Although proven to be effective, ethanol is associated with limitations and major complications (local and systemic).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1531003512457205">45</xref></sup> Early in our study, 7 (6.7%) patients were treated with ES. Of these, 2 patients had ulceration at the injection site, 1 experienced transient pulmonary hypertension during ES treatment, and 1 KTS patient had an episode of deep venous thrombosis following ES. Complications occurred despite careful exercise of necessary precautions to reduce the morbidity and complications involved in ES. Treatment with ES was effective in 63.6% of patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1531003512457205">Table 5</xref>). Although the small number of patients treated with ES prevents us from deriving a statistically significant conclusion about its safety and efficacy, the morbidity associated with this treatment modality and the type of complications found in this study are consistent with other reports in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1531003512457205">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1531003512457205">28</xref></sup>

<p>Given the limitations associated with surgical resection, the high incidence of morbidity associated with ES, and the relatively recent FDA approval of polidocanol, our group uses STS in the form of microfoam for the treatment of LFVM. The use of sclerosants in microfoam form significantly improves the procedure technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1531003512457205">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1531003512457205"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1531003512457205">48</xref></sup> The foam bubbles displace intralesional blood, thereby preventing the sclerosant from becoming diluted, thus achieving maximal effective exposure between the sclerosing agent and the endothelial lining. These properties make it possible to use smaller doses of sclerosant, decreasing the risk of side effects and toxicity. The echogenicity of microfoam bubbles made them visible on US surveillance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1531003512457205">Figure 7</xref>), which made the procedure easier to perform, ensuring that the injection of foam was intraluminal, and this was important in preventing extravasation necrosis.</p>

<p>Results from this study demonstrate a high degree of success and safety of STS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1531003512457205">Table 5</xref>). All patients tolerated STS FS procedures well, and there were no complications associated with the treatment, either local or systemic. In all, 92.9% of patients with localized or diffuse lesions responded to STS FS. Morphologically, lesions that were successfully treated with STS were macrocystic and were characterized by the absence of multiple vascular channels. Two (7.1%) VM patients did not respond to STS FS treatment. The associated LFVMs were morphologically characterized by numerous, septated, microcystic lesions. Because FS treats only those vessels that are injected with the sclerosant, these patients did not respond to STS FS because distribution of sclerosant into all vascular channels is poor in a microcystic environment. Following surgical resection, we achieved excellent results in both patients. From our experience, small, superficial, localized, encapsulated, and microcystic LFVMs composed of numerous small venous lakes are the most amenable to surgical resection. In the present study, we completely cured 26.1% of VMs with STS FS, and the majority of these lesions were relatively small in size.</p>
<p>The only minor adverse event associated with the STS FS was a transient vasovagal episode, which occurred in a 42-year-old female patient with a VM. After a short recovery period, the procedure was successfully continued. Relatively recently, some authors have voiced concern that foam-induced microembolism is a common phenomenon during FS and that caution should be exercised in using FS, especially in patients with patent foramen ovale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1531003512457205">49</xref></sup> Although we did not routinely screen our patients for patent foramen ovale, no neurological or visual defects occurred during the course of this study. To prevent the possibility of distal embolic events on the arterial side, we excluded all malformations with arterial flow prior to starting the treatment. In our study, there were virtually no side effects. One possible explanation for the absence of adverse effects related to STS FS in our study is that evaluation and selection of patients was done by a multidisciplinary approach, and we used proper preoperative preparation, operative technique, and continuous US imaging, as described in the Methods section of this study.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we started using polidocanol following the FDA approval of Asclera (Chemische Fabrik Kreussler &amp; Company, Wiesbaden, Germany). Our initial experience with polidocanol in a small number of patients demonstrated high efficacy and safety rates that were comparable with the results documented in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1531003512457205">50</xref></sup> In our study (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1531003512457205">Table 4</xref>), 11.4%, 5.7%, and 4.8% of patients with VM, LM, and KTS, respectively, received conservative management only because treatment with STS FS is not indicated in all LFVM patients. Conservative management included observation (with instructions to the patients to contact the vascular malformation team coordinator if their condition worsens), compression therapy, and lifestyle modification.</p>
<p>Limitations to the current study include the fact that a subjective grading scale system (based on patient- and physician-derived goals of therapy) rather than an objective scoring system was used to assess the patient’s response to treatment. Routine postprocedural imaging could provide more definitive proof of STS FS efficacy because some patients could have a marked reduction in lesion size at MR imaging without corresponding symptomatic improvement. In addition, because this was a nonrandomized study, we were unable to directly compare ES with STS FS. Given the very low prevalence of LFVMs in the general population and the high incidence of complications associated with ES treatment, direct randomized comparison between STS (and/or polidocanol) and ethanol may ultimately prove challenging to perform. Finally, as mentioned above, the small number of patients treated with ES and polidocanol prevented us from deriving a statistically significant conclusion about the safety and efficacy of these 2 treatment modalities, save that initial experience with polidocanol demonstrated that it was a safe and effective sclerosant.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that STS in the form of microfoam is technically feasible, safe, and effective in the treatment of LFVMs. Compared with STS FS, traditional treatment with ethanol is less effective and is associated with high complication rates. Initial experience with polidocanol treatment is promising, but further prospective studies are needed to confirm our observations. Multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation and dceMRI are of paramount importance to identify patients who will benefit from any number of patient- and lesion-appropriate treatment strategies in our armamentarium. Symptomatic, diffuse, extensive, macrocystic LFVMs and LFVMs that involve multiple tissue planes and vital structures are best treated with STS FS. It has to be emphasized that treatment of extensive lesions with STS FS is palliative and goal oriented. Pretreatment goals should be determined by the patient and physician at initial evaluation. LFVMs that are characterized by microcystic, septated vessels do not respond to FS, and these lesions are best treated with surgical resection. Primary surgical resection is also the treatment of choice for localized, microcystic, and superficial LFVMs.</p>

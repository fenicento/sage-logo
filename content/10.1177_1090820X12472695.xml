      <p>On basilar photographs, the nasal base can be divided into an <italic>upper</italic> cartilaginous portion and a <italic>lower</italic> soft tissue portion. The lower nasal base can be subdivided into the columellar base, nostril sills, and alar lobules. Due to its noncartilaginous composition, the static shape and dynamic function of the lower nasal base are determined by skin, subcutaneous tissue, and nasal muscles. Surprisingly, there have been few in-depth anatomical studies of this area. Currently, most rhinoplasty surgeons focus their analysis and operative techniques on the upper nasal base, with its alar cartilages. They tend to minimize the importance of the lower nasal base, composed of the columellar base, nostril sills, and alar lobules. The requisite operative techniques are often considered ancillary techniques.</p>
      <p>Because the lower nasal base is an important dynamic functional component of the nose and its composition is determined by numerous muscles that help to form the columellar base, nostril sills, and alar lobules, it deserves further study. Functionally, profound changes occur in the dilatation and compression of the nostrils due to the dynamic interplay of their muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and fibrous septa. Equally, the lower nasal base represents the interface of the intraface through its connections with the facial superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS). In this article, we discuss the current literature and our findings from a dissection study of 45 fresh cadavers.</p>

         <title>Cadaver Study</title>
         <p>To fully understand the anatomy of this region, we performed dissection studies in 45 fresh cadavers at the time of autopsy. These were not fresh-frozen cadavers, nor were there any storage distortions. All dissections were done under 2.5× to 3.5× loupe magnification. An initial 15 dissections were done to identify specific structures and areas of interest. Next, a definitive series of 15 cadavers totaling 30 hemi-nose dissections were done. Subsequently, an additional 15 dissections were completed to clarify specific points, and biopsies were taken for histological studies.</p>
         <p>In an additional 3 cadavers, the entire nose was excised “en bloc” and the nostrils packed to avoid distortion during the fixation process. All specimens were immediately fixed in 10% formalin. After decalcification in 5% chlorhydric acid, the specimens were embedded in paraffin. Full-width cross sections were then done at 7 levels, stained with Masson trichrome, and observed under light microscopy.</p>

         <p>As part of our study, we performed a literature review, searching for articles related to the levator labii superioris alaeque nasalis, orbicularis oris, depressor septi nasalis, myrtiformis, and dilator naris. The following review of our results is an attempt to simplify and reconcile the surgical anatomy of the nasal musculature that affects the lower nasal base, as derived from our own cadaver dissections and those in the literature. Due to differences in terminology, any discussion of the nasal musculature is fraught with confusion and conflict. As noted in sequential editions of <italic>Gray’s Anatomy</italic>, the myrtiformis muscle was included as a nasal muscle, then deleted, and eventually restored.<sup>

            <p>The levator labii superioris alaeque nasalis (LLSAN) has often been classified as one of the many muscles of the mouth, yet its impact on the nose is even greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X12472695">Figure 3</xref>). Its origin is on the frontal process of the maxilla, nasal bone, and medial canthus. It then descends in 2 parts: alaris and labiocolumellaris.<sup>

The <italic>labial portion</italic> continues around the nasal base toward the philtral column of the upper lip, intermingling with the fibers of the myrtiformis and orbicularis oris. The alaris portion lifts and expands the nostril, whereas the labial portion depresses the tip. The LLSAN was easily and consistently identified in all of our dissections. After its alaris portion inserts into the alar base, the medial border of the labial portion becomes the defining muscle of the alar crease, and the lateral border helps define the triangle area between the nasolabial line and alar base. The labial portion continues toward the columellar base with its inferior border joining the superficial portion of the orbicularis oris. Through its intermingling with the superficial orbicularis oris muscle, it acts as a significant depressor of the nostril tip.</p>

               </sup> has divided the orbicularis oris muscle into a deep and a superficial portion. The deep portion of the orbicularis oris exists as long, continuous fibers from one modiolus to the other. It functions as an oral constrictor. The superficial portion of the orbicularis oris is divided into a lower nasolabial bundle (superficial orbicularis oris labialis [SOOL]) and an upper nasal bundle (superficial orbicularis oris nasalis [SOON]) whose function is both speech and facial expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X12472695">Figure 4</xref>). The SOOL is essentially a transverse muscle originating on each side from the modiolus, then running across the lip to insert into the skin as either short fibers (ipsilateral philtral column) or long fibers (contralateral philtral column). The SOON originates laterally from the 2 zygomaticus and 2 levator muscles on either side and then runs on an angle up into the columellar base. From our dissections, the superficial orbicularis oris was extensive and easily divided into SOOL and SOON based on the orientation of the muscle fibers. In contrast to the surgical literature, the nasal portion of the superficial orbicular oris (SOON) was found to be an integral and critical portion of the lower nasal base. As the SOON ascends medially, it defines the upper lip, whereas its fusion with the LLSAN sets off the paranasal triangle. Inferiorly, it is tempting to speculate that the skin expression of the “transverse line” that occurs on forceful smiling represents the junction between the SOOL and SOON. Most important, it is the midline fusion of the 2 SOON, which constitutes the bulk of the muscle tissue in the columellar base. In 14 of 15 cadavers in our study, the depressor septi nasalis was a paired deep muscle originating from the maxilla and did not provide the majority of the muscle mass to the columellar base.

         <title>Surgical Relevance of the Lower Nasal Base</title>
         <p>This study began with several clinical questions. What is the anatomical composition of the columellar base? How do we narrow the columellar base? Why is there such a wide range of nostril sill shapes among patients? As the dissections continued, it became obvious that these structures collectively formed an important anatomical entity—the lower nasal base. Thus, we have defined the anatomical composition of this region and its relationship to adjacent structures. The next step will be to design surgical techniques to correct clinical deformities.</p>
         <p>One example of how to utilize this information involves management of the dynamic plunging tip. For years, the recommended technique was to resect the belly of the DSN at the level of the anterior nasal spine. Then, Rohrich et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12472695">12</xref>
            </sup> emphasized that detaching the muscle through an intraoral approach and sewing the 2 muscles together was more effective. Yet, if one sees the etiology of the “dynamic” plunging tip as an interplay between the DSN and the deep portion of Pitanguy’s midline ligament, then there are other options. First, one can interrupt the continuity of this fibromuscular structure at either end. In thick-skinned patients, resection of the soft tissue overlying the alar cartilages effectively resects all of Pitanguy’s midline ligament and breaks the continuity.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090820X12472695">29</xref>
            </sup> An even more elegant solution may be to shorten the deep ligament, as demonstrated by Cakir et al.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090820X12472695">30</xref>
            </sup> Yet another issue will be to determine the most effective method of narrowing the alar base, not just statically but also dynamically. Certainly, the structural integrity of the tela subcutanea cutis and its position above the dynamic modiolus alae nasi leads one to question the existence of any tether effect and even the existence of any ligaments from the pyriform aperture to the alar lobule. It is our opinion that the dynamic role of the LLSAN in dilating the nostril bases has been underemphasized. Ultimately, it may be the injection of botulinum toxin to block this muscle laterally that offers the best solution for limiting dynamic widening of the alar base.<sup>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Our findings indicate that a distinct <italic>lower nasal base</italic> exists and it consists of the columellar base, nostril sills, and alar lobules. It is composed of soft tissue, including numerous nasofacial muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and fibrous septa. It is extremely dynamic. The interaction of these tissues influences compression and dilatation of the nostrils and external valves. For too long, rhinoplasty surgeons have ignored the lower nasal base and focused their attention on the upper nasal base with its alar cartilages. It is our hope that a clear understanding of these anatomical findings will ultimately lead to new surgical procedures, which may well include techniques for narrowing the wide columellar base and minimizing the plunging nasal tip.</p>

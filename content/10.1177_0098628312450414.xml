<abstract>
<p>Teaching researchers commonly employ group-based collaborative learning approaches in Teaching of Psychology teaching activities. However, the authors know relatively little about the effectiveness of group-based activities in relation to known psychological processes associated with group dynamics. Therefore, the authors conducted a meta-analytic examination of whether learning outcomes are moderated by aspects of group process and collaborative learning. Results indicated that (a) group duration of a brief period (one to three classes) was more effective than group duration lasting more than one-half semester, (b) high levels of participant interdependence were associated with greater learning outcomes, and (c) group activities incorporating a formal group project presentation evidenced significantly less robust learning outcomes than activities that did not include a formal group presentation. Based on the findings, the authors provide teaching suggestions that reflect how group processes may impact learning effectiveness.</p>

<p>Small group collaborative learning approaches in the classroom have been advocated for many years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0098628312450414">Sharan &amp; Sharan, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0098628312450414">1991</xref>). When students discuss and solve problems in small groups rather than individually, this form of learning is referred to as collaborative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0098628312450414">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0098628312450414">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0098628312450414">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0098628312450414">Smith, Sheppard, Johnson, &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). Collaborative learning activities may benefit student learning in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0098628312450414">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>) as well as student learning of psychological phenomena more specifically (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0098628312450414">Perkins &amp; Saris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0098628312450414">Tomcho, Wolfe, &amp; Foels, 2006</xref>). Teachers often use group activities to accomplish goals beyond just learning material (e.g., increasing teamwork) or to lighten the work load of an otherwise unmanageable assignment (e.g., a project involving data collection, analysis, and presentation).</p>
<p>A collaborative learning approach offers potential value for students because it may foster the collaboration skills advocated by the American Psychological Association (APA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0098628312450414">Halonen et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0098628312450414">Landrum, Hettich, and Wilmer (2010</xref>) suggests that the most important skill for success in the workplace as recommended by psychology alumni was an ability to work with others. The high value that employers place on teamwork also was highlighted in a recent report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0098628312450414">Hart Research Associates (2008</xref>) commissioned by the Association of American Colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0098628312450414">Meyers (1997</xref>) narratively reviewed the existing literature on small group collaborative learning activities published in the Teaching of Psychology (ToP) and recommended aspects of group learning activity designs to increase student participation and to minimize social loafing (i.e., allowing others to do more work). However, as Meyers did not examine the effectiveness of small group collaborative learning approaches on learning outcomes, teachers could be unknowingly introducing group processes that influence learning either positively or negatively. Although the educational benefits of collaborative learning are documented from elementary through tertiary education in domains across all major curricular subjects including biology, mathematics, chemistry, physical sciences, and computer sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0098628312450414">Marr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0098628312450414">Smith et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0098628312450414">Springer, Stanne, &amp; Donovan, 1997</xref>), its effectiveness in learning about psychological phenomena has received little attention. Therefore, our goal in this study was to determine the effectiveness of group learning activities and to identify potential factors that may predict effective learning outcomes.</p>
<p>We examined the group process literature, and the collaborative learning literature, to identify potential explanations for sources of variability in learning outcomes. From the literature on group processes, we identified three factors that might explain variability in learning outcomes: group size (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0098628312450414">Wheelan, 2009</xref>), group duration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0098628312450414">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1990</xref>), and task complexity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450414">Campbell, 1988</xref>). From the literature on collaborative learning, we identified five factors: preactivity preparation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0098628312450414">Driscoll, 2005</xref>), level of participant interdependence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0098628312450414">Hogan &amp; Tudge, 1999</xref>), incorporation of a peer assessment component (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0098628312450414">Meyers, 1997</xref>), group accountability that may be demonstrated through the presentation of a group goal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1996</xref>), and individual accountability that may be achieved through the inclusion of a writing assignment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0098628312450414">Snowman, McCown, &amp; Biehler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0098628312450414">Wheeler &amp; McDonald, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Group Processes</title>
<sec id="section2-0098628312450414">
<title>Group Size</title>
<p>From the literature on group cohesion, researchers generally have posited that performance will decrease as group size increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0098628312450414">Petty, Harkins, Williams, &amp; Latane, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0098628312450414">Wheelan, 2009</xref>). Perhaps, the most problematic evidence against learning outcomes in larger groups comes from the literature on social loafing. Social loafing occurs when individuals expend less effort on a group project while expecting to benefit from the efforts of other group members, and this phenomenon is known to increase as the group size increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0098628312450414">Karau &amp; Williams, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0098628312450414">Latane, Williams, &amp; Harkins, 1979</xref>). Given the concern of social loafing in cooperative learning groups raised by several educational researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450414">Aggarwal &amp; O’Brien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0098628312450414">Meyers, 1997</xref>), we predicted that group size would be negatively related to learning outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0098628312450414">
<title>Group Duration</title>
<p>Group researchers have suggested that the duration of a group’s existence can have a positive impact on a group’s performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0098628312450414">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0098628312450414">Wheelan, Davidson, &amp; Tilan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0098628312450414">Yalom &amp; Leszcz, 2005</xref>). However, groups that are time limited may have participants who exhibit less social loafing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0098628312450414">Kelly &amp; McGrath, 1985</xref>), and therefore are more likely to stay on task. Thus, we predicted that the longer a group existed, the more likely that the group’s overall performance, and as such the learning that occurs, would be lower.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0098628312450414">
<title>Task Complexity</title>
<p>In his often cited analysis of group tasks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450414">Campbell (1988</xref>) developed a fourfold typology of task complexity: decision tasks, judgment tasks, problem tasks, and fuzzy tasks. Decision tasks involve evaluating several alternative outcomes along relevant dimensions. In collaborative group learning activities, an example decision task would be debating activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450414">Carroll, 2006</xref>). Judgment tasks require integrating diverse information and making judgments about future events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450414">Campbell, 1988</xref>). An example teaching activity might involve the analysis of case study information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0098628312450414">Hall &amp; Seery, 2006</xref>). Problem tasks involve “finding the best way to achieve an outcome” when confronted with multiple related pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450414">Campbell, 1988</xref>, p. 47). In teaching activities an example of this task may comprise hypothesis testing activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0098628312450414">Perkins &amp; Saris, 2001</xref>). Fuzzy tasks involve selecting from several possible outcomes when there are multiple ways in which the desired outcome could be determined. In teaching activities, an example of this task might involve making a creative project (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0098628312450414">Pettijohn &amp; Perelli, 2005</xref>). In addition to these four types of task complexity, a task that contains none of the above attributes of complexity can be designated as a simple task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450414">Campbell, 1988</xref>, p. 46). Given that teaching activity tasks may involve any of the four task complexity types, or be a simple task that lacks complexity, we examined the type of task to see whether different tasks produce a greater effect on learning.</p>

<title>Collaborative Learning</title>
<sec id="section6-0098628312450414">
<title>Preactivity Preparation</title>
<p>Stimulating prior learning through some type of practice or preactivity preparation (e.g., completing a worksheet before the activity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0098628312450414">Hall &amp; Seery, 2006</xref>) may ensure adequate preparation for students to fully participate in the group activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0098628312450414">Gagné &amp; Driscoll, 1988</xref>). Instructor use of advance organizers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628312450414">Ausubel, Novak, &amp; Hanesian, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0098628312450414">Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0098628312450414">West, Farmer, &amp; Wolff, 1991</xref>) can help activate students’ prior knowledge which relates to, and as such can facilitate, learning new material. Indeed, a prominent early step in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0098628312450414">Gagné and Medsker’s (1996)</xref> instructional paradigm is to stimulate the recall of prior learning in order to facilitate the encoding of new information. Therefore, we predicted that researchers whose group activities included a preactivity preparation component would have greater learning outcomes than those without a preactivity preparation component.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0098628312450414">
<title>Participant Interdependence</title>
<p>Student interaction that involves coordinated interdependence may facilitate learning outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0098628312450414">Skilton, Forsyth, &amp; White, 2008</xref>). Learning may result from a deeper cognitive processing of material as a result of discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0098628312450414">Webb, 1992</xref>), or by scaffolding learning through interactions with others with more advanced understanding of the material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0098628312450414">Hogan &amp; Tudge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1996</xref>). Therefore, group activities which involve greater levels of interdependence may lead to better learning due to greater coordination of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0098628312450414">Latane, Williams, &amp; Harkins, 1979</xref>). Thus, we predicted that group activities with high levels of participant interdependence would demonstrate more positive learning outcomes compared to those judged to have low levels of participant interdependence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0098628312450414">
<title>Peer Assessment</title>
<p>In group activities where peers assess other group members’ contributions and performance there is likely to be more positive learning outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0098628312450414">Joseph &amp; Payne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0098628312450414">Michaelsen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0098628312450414">Topping, 1998</xref>). Peer assessment may lead to better learning outcomes by encouraging group members to take increased responsibility for their efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450414">Docy, Segers, Sluijsmans, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0098628312450414">Gueldenzoph &amp; May, 2002</xref>). In addition, peer assessment makes it more likely that students will attend to the material to be assessed and may facilitate critical thinking skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450414">Cathey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0098628312450414">Dunn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0098628312450414">Freeman &amp; Dyrenfurth, 2003</xref>/2004). Therefore, we predicted that researchers who included a peer assessment component in group activities would have greater learning outcomes in their studies compared to researchers who did not include a peer assessment component.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0098628312450414">
<title>Group Accountability</title>
<p>Researchers who structure group activities in which the group is held accountable for achieving its goals are more likely to have involved participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0098628312450414">Schlenker &amp; Weigold, 1989</xref>) which may lead to better learning outcomes. One common group goal is for groups’ to present the results of their group work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450414">Barkely, Cross, &amp; Major, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1990</xref>). Group presentations often involve coordinating work among group members and may help facilitate the APA’s goal of collaboration skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450414">American Psychological Association [APA], 2007</xref>). Given that group presentation skills have a high potential for facilitating scientific inquiry skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0098628312450414">Tomcho et al., 2008</xref>), we predicted that researchers who incorporated a measure of group accountability in their group activities would have more positive learning outcomes than those that did not include a measure of group accountability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0098628312450414">
<title>Individual Accountability</title>
<p>Instructors who make individual students accountable for their actions in a group activity may have students who learn more from the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0098628312450414">Meyers, 1997</xref>) due to increased on-task behavioral self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0098628312450414">Schlenker &amp; Weigold, 1989</xref>) and increased cognitive information processing of the material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0098628312450414">Tetlock, 1985</xref>). One approach to facilitate individual accountability is for instructors to incorporate a writing assignment associated with the group learning activity that may help promote student involvement in the group activity and help diminish social loafing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0098628312450414">Wheeler and McDonald (1998)</xref> argue that writing about a group activity helps to clarify information by having students think comprehensively about a topic. Moreover, students’ written communication may help foster links between the group activity and other course material, resulting in deeper connections, potentially producing more meaningful learning. Therefore, we predicted that researchers who incorporated individual writing assignments into their group activities would have more positive student learning outcomes than researchers who did not include a writing assignment.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>With these predictor variables identified, we sought to determine the overall effectiveness of group collaborative learning approaches in teaching psychology and to identify what group process and collaborative learning factors predict the learning outcome effectiveness of small group learning approaches. To accomplish these goals, we conducted the following meta-analysis of collaborative learning effect sizes. Given that effect sizes are determined in part by power and teaching research suffers from low power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0098628312450414">Tomcho &amp; Foels, 2009</xref>), we would expect this limited power to impact the potential ability to detect relationships in our meta-analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0098628312450414">Hedges &amp; Pigott, 2001</xref>). Additionally, notable researchers have argued that adopting a more liberal Type-I error rate is advisable in exploratory research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0098628312450414">Cohen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0098628312450414">Hallahan &amp; Rosenthal, 1996</xref>). In the interests of maximizing the information that could be gleaned from the database, we adopted a more liberal Type-I error rate of α = .10 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0098628312450414">Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0098628312450414">Rosnow &amp; Rosenthal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0098628312450414">Tomcho &amp; Foels, 2009</xref>) for our hypothesis testing to allow for explorations of moderators that might offer potential applicability in the translation of research into classroom practice. Thus, we sought to identify potential factors that warrant both additional study and also offer applicability in the classroom.</p>

Teaching activities were included if they met the following five criteria: (a) published in the ToP between 1974 and 2011 (i.e., Volume 38, Issue 4); (b) provided empirical data testing the relation between a group activity and a learning outcome; (c) comprised an activity focused on teaching a topic rather than an activity focused on teachers’ evaluating a student (e.g., quizzes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0098628312450414">Marchant, 2002</xref>); (d) were classroom-based studies rather than experimental manipulations (e.g., we excluded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0098628312450414">Katayama, Shambaugh, &amp; Doctor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0098628312450414">Nevid &amp; Lampmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0098628312450414">Rosell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0098628312450414">Ruscio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0098628312450414">Saville, Zinn, &amp; Elliott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0098628312450414">Webster &amp; Muir, 1995</xref>) or studies wherein individual- and group-based activities were mixed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0098628312450414">Penningroth, Despain, &amp; Gray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0098628312450414">Schwarzmueller, 2011</xref>); (e) provided sufficient methodological detail to identify a group-level activity. We followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0098628312450414">Meyer’s (1997)</xref> approach to identify group activities as eligible for inclusion if researchers partitioned the class into small groups of primarily three or more students. Similarly, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0098628312450414">Meyer’s (1997)</xref> approach, we excluded articles that presented activities that (a) relied on the whole class as the members of one group participating in a single discussion or activity or (b) engaged in partner-oriented activity or (c) used a small subset of class participants to demonstrate a psychological phenomenon to the rest of the class. The goal of these criteria was to create an optimally homogenous set of collaborative group learning activities that would allow for meaningful comparisons across studies. Through this comprehensive approach, we identified a total of 35 articles as eligible for inclusion. Two of these articles conducted two studies with independent samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0098628312450414">Gier &amp; Kreiner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0098628312450414">Sagarin &amp; Lawler-Sagarin, 2005</xref>) and one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0098628312450414">Hager, 2011</xref>) assessed two types of learning outcomes (i.e., behavior change and attitudes). Thus, we identified 35 articles with a total of 37 independent studies with 38 assessed learning outcomes for inclusion in our database.</p>

<title>Learning outcomes</title>
<p>We followed the same procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0098628312450414">Tomcho and Foels (2008</xref>) to identify types of learning outcomes. Specifically, articles in the database were required to have utilized at least one of the four assessment forms for student learning outcomes: (a) the relation of teaching activity to nongraded knowledge gained (i.e., typically a knowledge test administered preactivity/postactivity or between experimental and comparison groups) or, (b) self-reported change in attitude or belief (i.e., typically measured using a Likert-type scale), (c) change in a behavior or skill (e.g., change in quality of writing sample), or (d) relation of the teaching activity to graded performance (e.g., exams, graded assignments, and course grades).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0098628312450414">
<title>Ratings</title>
<p>We trained two undergraduate coders to identify whether teaching activity articles identified as potentially includable for this meta-analysis utilized a group learning approach. The percentage agreement between coders’ ratings of learning approach used was greater than 90%, with discussion used to reach consensus. In addition, similar results were obtained for ratings of activities on the dimensions of task complexity and participant interdependence. For example, studies in which participants were judged to have a high level of interdependence may have utilized group activities that involved one or more of the following: (a) coordinated activity to achieve a common goal such as a presentation with a shared grade, (b) working together to solve a common problem or reach consensus, or (c) using shared resources to identify a solution to a real or imagined scenario. In contrast, studies in which participants were judged to have a low level of interdependence typically involved group activities that did not include any of the above criteria and wherein participants made primarily individual comments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450414">Cathey, 2007</xref>) or observed a demonstration within a group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0098628312450414">Enders, Laurenceau, &amp; Stuetzle, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section17-0098628312450414">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450414">Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp; Rothstein, 2005</xref>) to conduct random effects meta-analyses. For each hypothesis test, we computed the <italic>Z</italic>
<sub>Fisher</sub> effect size from <italic>r</italic>, <italic>t</italic>, <italic>F</italic>, or χ<sup>2</sup>. If statistical tests were not provided in a particular study, we computed the <italic>Z</italic>
<sub>Fisher</sub> effect size from summary statistics, or contingency table data, if available. Given that six of the teaching researchers used multiple conceptually similar hypothesis tests within a study, we used a common approach of calculating a Z<sub>Fisher</sub> effect size for each study by averaging sets of conceptually similar hypothesis tests (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0098628312450414">DiMatteo, Giordani, Lepper, &amp; Croghan, 2002</xref>). In those few instances where we were unable to recreate an exact probability from the data provided, we used the following one-tailed <italic>Z</italic>s: <italic>z</italic> = 1.645 for <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>z</italic> = 2.326 for <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and <italic>z</italic> = 3.09 for <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. For each study, the average <italic>Z</italic>
<sub>Fisher</sub> effect size represents the strength and direction of the association between the teaching activity and the measurement of learning outcome. Positive effect sizes indicate the association of more learning with use of the teaching activity.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0098628312450414">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, we conducted a random effects meta-analysis to test our hypotheses. Note that not all studies provided sufficient methodological detail to enable us to code all studies on all group process and collaborative learning variables. Therefore, we conducted analyses based on the <italic>k</italic> number of studies available for any given analysis (seven of the eight analyses were based on <italic>k</italic> &gt; 32). We first present an analysis of effect size differences by type of learning outcome and then present the overall effect of collaborative learning activities, followed by an examination of factors which may moderate the overall effect.</p>
<sec id="section19-0098628312450414">
<title>General Effect of Collaborative Learning Activities</title>
<p>The combined results of the tests of teaching effectiveness for collaborative learning activities (<italic>k</italic> = 37) revealed a significant <italic>Z</italic> = 7.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), large effect size (<italic>Z</italic>
<sub>Fisher</sub> = .494; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [.357, −.630]). Thus, collaborative learning activities demonstrated a large effect in producing changes in student learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0098628312450414">
<title>General Effect of Collaborative Learning Activities as a Function of Learning Outcome</title>
<p>For the learning outcome category of behavior/skills, only one study used self-reported changes in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0098628312450414">Hager, 2011</xref>) as the learning outcome, and only one study used changes in skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450414">Cathey, 2007</xref>) as the learning outcome, negating the ability to establish a stable effect size estimate for this learning outcome category. Because we could not establish a stable effect size estimate, there was no way to examine behavior/skills as a moderator of learning outcome effect size. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the potential moderating effect of learning outcome across the remaining 36 studies which used one of the three types of learning outcomes. Diffuse comparisons of effect sizes revealed no significant differences among effect sizes by type of learning outcome (Grade <italic>k</italic> = 18; Knowledge <italic>k</italic> = 9; Attitude <italic>k</italic> = 9) indicating a lack of variability around the typical or average effects in the studies grouped by different types of learning outcome, <italic>Q<sub>h</sub>
</italic>(2) = 2.673, <italic>p</italic> = .263. We concluded that the relationship between collaborative learning activity and learning outcome effect size did not vary by the type of outcome assessment. Thus, we were then able to examine the general effect of collaborative learning activities as a function of variables that moderate this effect.</p>

<title>Specific Effects of Collaborative Learning Activities by Moderator Variables</title>
<sec id="section22-0098628312450414">
<title>Group size</title>
<p>Meta-regression using unrestricted maximum likelihood estimation with group size (<italic>k</italic> = 33; <italic>M</italic> = 4.24, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.53) as the predictor variable revealed no effect of group size on learning outcomes (meta-regression coefficient = −0.02; 95% CI [−0.08, 0.04]; <italic>Z</italic> = −0.52, <italic>p</italic> = .60). Thus, contrary to our prediction that group size would be negatively related to learning, no such relationship was present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0098628312450414">
<title>Group duration</title>
<p>Comparisons of group duration revealed a significant difference between those groups in which the activity occurred over a brief period (one to three class sessions; <italic>k</italic> = 22; <italic>Z</italic>
<sub>Fisher</sub> = .61; 95% CI = [.41, .81]) versus those which occurred over a one half a semester or greater duration (<italic>k</italic> = 7; <italic>Z</italic>
<sub>Fisher</sub> = .22; 95% CI = [.12, .31]), <italic>Q<sub>h</sub>
</italic>(1) = 12.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Thus, our hypothesis was supported such that students participating in activities conducted over a brief period demonstrated better learning than in activities taking place over longer periods of time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0098628312450414">
<title>Task complexity</title>
<p>Recall that the literature did not afford clear predictions for task complexity. Therefore, we used diffuse comparisons to examine the effects of this variable on learning. There were no significant differences among learning outcome effect sizes by task complexity type (decision tasks <italic>k</italic> = 8, <italic>Z</italic>
<sub>Fisher</sub> = .46; 95% CI = [.28, .63]; judgment tasks <italic>k</italic> = 12, <italic>Z</italic>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Collaborative learning can be an effective approach for increasing student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0098628312450414">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Collaborative learning involves both pedagogical and group process factors but relatively little is known about the influence of group processes on student learning. Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of group collaborative learning approaches published in ToP with the goal of determining which group process and collaborative learning factors predict learning effectiveness.</p>
<p>Our results showed that collaborative learning approaches published in ToP have, on average, a medium effect size which indicates that group approaches have a moderate level of influence on student learning. Thus, a teacher might expect in general that a group activity will increase learning. However, despite deriving predictions from the group processes and collaborative learning literatures regarding several potential moderators, we found that only group duration, participant interdependence, peer assessment, and group accountability predicted student learning outcomes (with the latter two in a negative direction). Therefore, we discuss factors that moderate student learning outcomes in group activities and also provide suggestions for how these findings might be applied when designing teaching interventions.</p>
<p>As noted by experts in the area of cooperative learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0098628312450414">Smith et al., 2005</xref>), the issue of translating research findings into classroom practice is “the least developed and probably the most difficult … [as they] are complex to both design and implement, [and] manage during the term” (p. 7). That stated, however, we provide for each finding practical applied teaching approaches which might be used in the classroom to enhance student learning outcomes</p>
<p>As predicted, we found that students in groups occurring during a brief period (one to three classes) had better learning outcomes than students in groups occurring during a period of classes lasting for one half of a semester or longer. This result may seem counterintuitive, given that students could become more comfortable interacting in the same group repeatedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0098628312450414">Wheelan et al., 2003</xref>). Ironically, that comfort level may be part of the problem if it facilitates social loafing. Alternatively, it may be that more complex tasks require groups to meet for a longer duration and as such the task rather than duration is associated with less learning. However, an ancillary post hoc analysis examining the relation between task complexity and longer group duration failed to support this possibility, <italic>Q<sub>h</sub>
</italic>(2) = 0.27, <italic>p</italic> = .87. Therefore, it appears that students may evidence greater learning if teaching activities are designed to be completed within a brief time of one to three class periods. If teachers use multiple group projects occurring across the semester, students’ learning may increase if groups are reconstituted regularly and the group activities are structured so as to be completed in a brief period of time.</p>
<p>Students performed better when there was not a group accountability component (as measured by a group presentation) than when there was a group accountability component. Although this counterintuitive finding is contrary to the majority of literature, there are studies that suggest that not all students have positive experiences in group work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0098628312450414">Colbeck, Campbell, &amp; Bjorklund, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0098628312450414">Forrest &amp; Miller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0098628312450414">Walker, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0098628312450414">2006</xref>). Indeed, setting aside the issue of social loafing’s likely negative impact on learning, if a group task is structured such that each student is only responsible for one component of the overall project, students’ may not learn all of the material, and thus not perform as well on assessments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628312450414">Bacon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1990</xref>). Thus, if teachers use a group accountability measure, it should be coupled with structured interactions among students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1996</xref>) to ensure that each student is necessarily involved in, and understands all aspects of, the activity in order to maximize learning potential (see e.g., student teams–achievement teams discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0098628312450414">Slavin, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Students performed better when participant interdependence was high than when participant interdependence was low. This finding not only parallels existing research on collaborative learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0098628312450414">Michaelsen &amp; Sweet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0098628312450414">Skilton, Forsyth, &amp; White, 2008</xref>) but also parallels findings in other areas of science education (e.g., physics; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37a-0098628312450414">Hake, 1998</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37a-0098628312450414">Hake (1998)</xref> demonstrated, classroom based student-to-student interaction yields higher learning scores when compared with students experiencing just traditional lectures. Thus, it appears that higher levels of student interdependence may facilitate greater levels of student engagement with course material than they might otherwise experience. We suggest that teachers use collaborative learning activities that have a high level of interdependence, such as games requiring plotting strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450414">Bizer, 2005</xref>), debating groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450414">Carroll, 2006</xref>), or presenting vignettes that students discuss with the goal of reaching consensual judgment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0098628312450414">Pawlow, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to our prediction, we found that students who participated in collaborative learning activities that incorporated a peer assessment component exhibited less robust learning outcomes than those who participated in collaborative learning activities in which peer assessment was absent. Although the literature supports the notion that incorporating a peer assessment component is associated with greater learning outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0098628312450414">Joseph &amp; Payne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0098628312450414">Michaelsen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0098628312450414">Topping, 1998</xref>), perhaps as a function of encouraging group members to take increased responsibility for their efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450414">Docy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0098628312450414">Gueldenzoph &amp; May, 2002</xref>), our data set did not support this view. This finding may result from group members being more concerned with being evaluating by peers and less about learning the material (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0098628312450414">Pope, 2005</xref>). We suggest that teachers should carefully weigh the educational benefits of incorporating a peer assessment component because the current data indicates a diminished learning effect is possible. Those teachers who do choose to incorporate peer assessment should have students make global judgments based on clearly communicated evaluation criteria (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0098628312450414">Falchikov &amp; Goldfinch, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that student learning outcomes were not moderated by group size, task complexity, preactivity preparation, or individual accountability. These findings within a collaborative learning task are surprising, given that preactivity preparation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0098628312450414">Gagné &amp; Driscoll, 1988</xref>), and individual accountability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0098628312450414">Wheeler &amp; McDonald, 1998</xref>) are known to influence learning. However, we do have evidence that group activities overall have a moderate effect on learning. Thus, in-group activities, these variables with nonsignificant results may be less important to student learning outcomes. In other words, group activities may provide a benefit to learning that is not further influenced by variables that otherwise moderate learning when not conducting group activities. Unfortunately, it is not possible given current data to disentangle the learning effects of each of the investigated variables. Moreover, it is possible that the group process variables we examined in this study operate in a different manner for students in the classroom who have a vested interest in the outcomes of their group activity, as compared to research participants in empirical studies of these phenomena.</p>
<p>Given that none of the studies in our database specifically included an assessment of collaboration skills, we cannot speak to whether participating in a group activity actually enhances these skills. It is worthwhile to note however, that group activities may provide a mechanism through which the APA goal of collaboration skills is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0098628312450414">Halonen et al., 2003</xref>). Further, these skills are highly valued by both alumni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0098628312450414">Landrum, Hettich, &amp; Wilmer, 2010</xref>) and employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0098628312450414">Hart Research Associates, 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that teachers will continue to employ group activities with the goal of improving collaboration skills. We recommend that teachers include an assessment of group collaboration skills as part of group activity designs to ensure that this goal is met. Teachers including an assessment of these skills would have the added benefit of informing the literature about the effectiveness of group activities.</p>
<p>We note an important caution and potential limitation to our results. Our finding that several previously identified factors did not predict learning outcomes is somewhat surprising, given the existing literature on collaborative learning. However, it may be that our findings are limited by the relatively small number of studies that were included in our study. Although meta-analyses are more powerful than primary-level research, meta-analysis can suffer from insufficient power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0098628312450414">Hedges &amp; Pigott, 2001</xref>). It is also true that teaching activity research has been limited by insufficient power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0098628312450414">Tomcho &amp; Foels, 2009</xref>). Given that teaching activities produce on average a medium effect on learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0098628312450414">Tomcho &amp; Foels, 2008</xref>), it is important to note that of the studies included in our database, fewer than 25% (<italic>k</italic> = 9) had sufficient power to detect a medium effect size. Therefore, due to power limitations, the current results may not accurately reflect the true nature of the relationship between tested variables. We attempted to deal with the issue of power limitations in the current meta-analysis by setting the α level at .10 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0098628312450414">Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0098628312450414">Rosnow &amp; Rosenthal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0098628312450414">Tomcho &amp; Foels, 2009</xref>) in order to identify important translational variables that otherwise would have been overlooked with the conventional α of .05. This more liberal approach did result in one additional finding which may assist teachers in their development of group activities. Nonetheless, teaching researchers should attend to power issues when developing studies designed to empirically assess the effectiveness of educational interventions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, group activities of shorter duration, with higher levels of participant interdependence, and the absence of a group presentation or peer assessment are associated with greater learning outcomes. Therefore, from an applied teaching standpoint, teachers should incorporate the above findings into group activities, such as using team problem solving or debating activities, wherein all participants are actively engaged in the learning of all material. Students also may benefit by having opportunities to participate with different individuals in different groups throughout the semester. Finally, the focus of this meta-analysis was on the effect of group activities on learning outcomes. However, teachers use group activities not only to promote learning of material but also to enhance collaboration skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450414">APA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0098628312450414">Tomcho et al., 2008</xref>). As a result, teachers should assess whether these collaborative learning activities are actually increasing students’ collaboration skills.</p>

<abstract>
<p>As the world becomes smaller in a small field like gifted education, cross-cultural research gives us a unique opportunity to understand top students and academic interventions in a deeper way. In this article, the author describes the importance of cross-cultural research as a way to serve gifted children globally. A description of a well-articulated research plan; a list of topics of interest to the field that could provide important data for gifted education policy, practice, and future research; and a case study of a successful cross-cultural research study are included to provide a basis for building a research agenda.</p>

<p>As more program activity in gifted education has been generated in many countries around the world, the stage is set for more cross-cultural research to occur. More nations have begun to place a strong emphasis on gifted education as they have recognized the importance of developing top students for global competition in a number of fields as well as entrance into top-tier institutions at the university level. No area of the world has been more active in this effort than the Asia Pacific, including the Middle East. Countries like Korea have placed a strong emphasis on student development in the sciences, including special university-based programs that supplement classroom activities. In Saudi Arabia, the nationwide strategy includes setting up various sites around the country to deliver differentiated instruction. In the UAE, the grand plan is to train all teachers to become more skilled in working with the gifted. Malaysia has invested heavily in a teacher training program to promote the use of gifted education strategies in instruction for all, including the targeting of university faculty for instruction in the use of critical thinking and problem-based learning. Even Japan has now entered into the use of materials that are differentiated for the gifted as a basis for enhancing science instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212471451">Asia-Pacific Federation on Giftedness, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet program development is best accomplished effectively in tandem with good research efforts that allow us to understand what works with the gifted learners in a given context at a given stage of development. New efforts, even if they are based on research-based approaches, need to be studied in respect to student outcomes and the processes that underlay successful implementation. For example, the use of differentiated projects is a common approach that we find support for in the research literature, and many programs worldwide use the approach as a key part of their program. Yet often we fail to collect student assessment data on the quality of the products developed and fail to use the data to make judgments about the effectiveness of the learning that has accrued. We also do not document the conditions under which successful project work takes place: What is the grouping approach used? What is the time frame of the project? What learnings accrue from doing a particular project? and How does the project fit in or align with other learnings? Such conditions influence the capacity for successful replication of such approaches from one culture to another.</p>
<p>Although the United States has been the source of many models and theories about giftedness, many of them have not been tested in the research arena, even in the originating country (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212471451">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>, for example, for an overview of curriculum model research). Thus, it is difficult to think about effective replication of the model in a very different context. Cross-cultural research allows us to study and compare results and conditions for success in gifted student programming.</p>
<sec id="section1-0162353212471451">
<title>Why Is Cross-Cultural Research Important?</title>
<p>Part of the purpose of any research agenda is to answer questions of importance in a field of study. The United States has had a strong programmatic research agenda that originated with the Javits projects, funded by the U.S. Department of Education, from 1989 to 2010. These projects, which included a National Research Center, have yielded some important findings about what works with gifted students in a variety of school contexts. They also have highlighted particular needs in the field such as teacher training in differentiation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212471451">Westberg, Archambeault, Dobyns, &amp; Salvin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212471451">Westberg &amp; Daoust, 2003</xref>) and the use of accelerative strategies such as compacting (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212471451">Reis et al., 2007</xref>). Yet these studies have all been done on populations in the United States, and many of the studies have not been replicated.</p>
<p>Cross-cultural research, defined as an effort to compare the use of an intervention or practice in one culture with the same intervention in another or the comparative understanding of constructs like motivation and self-concept, has the potential to provide validation of many U.S. models and practices while also advancing the program development work in another culture.</p>
<p>As the world becomes smaller in a small field like gifted education, cross-cultural research gives us a unique opportunity to understand top students and the interventions that are designed for them in a deeper way. We can begin to understand the facilitative and impedimentary factors that influence program implementation in various settings. Some of these would be within the context as well as across contexts. For example, in the United States, differences in implementation effectiveness are less based on geographic location than on how schools are organized, what they value, and the support structures they have in place to receive an innovation and keep it going.</p>
<p>Just as we have comparative data available cross-culturally on performance on international tests like the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), so too it would be helpful to see how our gifted programs are beginning to affect student learning worldwide. The use of multiple measures to assess learning will call for more complex designs to make inferences, yet such designs are crucial to making the process credible.</p>
<p>Some assessments of top-student growth routinely are available on a worldwide basis. Competitions like the Olympiads allow us to see the standards for those students who win in this competition. The Intel competition lets us see the level of science projects that are successful worldwide, providing mentors and others insights into the standards of excellence required to compete successfully. The Future Problem-Solving competitions focus on which teams are successful in collaboration, communication, and the process of creative problem solving. Yet these data are not compiled annually or examined for a deeper understanding of the results in respect to world standards in these various fields.</p>
<p>On the psychological side, it is important to examine the issues and problems that gifted students face on a global basis. For example, developing relationships is often cited in the literature as an important concern of the gifted in both elementary and middle school years in the United States. To what extent is relationship formation a challenge for the gifted worldwide? Are there contextual variables that contribute to these problems in some cultures that are not present in others? How does dealing with relationships manifest itself as a problem in different contexts? Having a sense of these issues cross-culturally helps us understand the way the problems are rooted in personality and yet mediated by the social interaction norms in a culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0162353212471451">
<title>What Are Some Priorities for Cross-Cultural Research?</title>
<p>In conducting educational research in any area, there are two maxims worth following. One of them is <italic>do no harm.</italic> It is important to maintain confidentiality of student data and to engage in research processes and educational applications that are consistent with positive educational growth and development of subjects. All universities have a human subject oversight committee that reviews all research projects conducted by faculty at that institution to guarantee that this maxim is followed. The principle of <italic>using results for the improvement of conditions</italic> is a second maxim I think we need to apply to our work in this field. In a small field with limited researchers and funding to carry out research, we must be pragmatic about what our priorities are for exploration.</p>
<p>Moreover, as we consider different possible research projects, it may be helpful to rate them in respect to three dimensions. These dimensions include the extent to which the study is consistent with the standards of good research in general; second, the extent to which the study represents a line of research important to the field of gifted education; and last, the extent to which the study will advance cross-cultural understanding and deepen international insights into a phenomenon.</p>
<p>The following key criteria may be used to judge the worthiness of a given research project in general terms:</p>
<list id="list1-0162353212471451" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Technically adequate: To what extent is the design of the research study appropriate? Are the instruments to be used in the study valid and reliable? Is the participant sample sufficient to make inferences to a larger population? Is there a well-articulated research base for the proposed project?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intellectually worthy: To what extent is the project grounded in important ideas that will advance the thinking in the field? How well-conceptualized are the research questions? Will the results improve policy in the countries involved?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Application to school and/or clinical practice: Will the findings build on earlier studies that delineate best practices? Can psychologists, counselors, administrators, and teachers in each culture use the findings to change practice in positive ways? Will the findings have implications for changing key aspects of program development for the gifted?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Addresses and answers important questions in the field: Will the study provide solution direction for a key problem in the field? Will the study provide an understanding of what does or does not work with gifted students in different cultural contexts? Will the study address practitioner concerns in the countries involved in the study?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provides focus and direction for further research studies: Will the study begin a new line of research that is promising on the topic of gifted learners? Will the study introduce an important model or concept to the field on which other researchers may build? Will the study constitute a pilot of a larger study to be done beyond the countries involved in the study?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Topics of interest to the field that could provide important data for gifted education policy, practice, and future research may include the following:</p>
<sec id="section3-0162353212471451">
<title>Interventions that work with gifted learners</title>
<p>Although we have some studies of effectiveness of curriculum and instruction with gifted learners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212471451">Gavin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212471451">Grigorenko, Jarvin, &amp; Sternberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212471451">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Stambaugh, 2009</xref>), we still have too few replications of existing studies and too small a group of studies that demonstrate the power of gifted programs in promoting learning within selected domains of learning or across domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0162353212471451">
<title>Psychological concerns of the gifted</title>
<p>The problems associated with growing up gifted, especially if one is highly gifted, continue to yield high interest and concern. Although we have some clinical studies to suggest the depth of the issue and some intervention protocols (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212471451">Cross &amp; Cross, 2011</xref>), more research is needed on understanding how to help gifted learners cope with perfectionism, underachievement, and selected learning problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0162353212471451">
<title>Career path variables: Domain-specific talent trajectories</title>
<p>Although we know that career education is an important intervention for the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212471451">Robinson, Shore, &amp; Enerson, 2007</xref>), there are too few contemporary studies of the process by which careers are selected and acted on. The Lubinski–Benbow Study for Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212471451">Wai, Lubinski, Benbow, &amp; Steiger, 2010</xref>), although it has demonstrated the outcomes at age 38 of students who experienced acceleration in healthy doses from middle school on, does not begin to identify the transition points in the talent development trajectory that led to such success in careers by adulthood. We need to know much more about successful trajectories of gifted students with differential profiles who succeed in specific domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0162353212471451">
<title>Teacher quality and effectiveness</title>
<p>The gatekeepers for appropriate interventions for gifted learners are their teachers. Therefore, we need more studies that document fidelity of implementation in the use of differentiated instruction. Although we have some evidence to suggest that professional development must occur initially, during implementation, and after it to institutionalize teacher use of such strategies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212471451">VanTassel-Baska et al., 2008</xref>), we need more data on successful models for teacher development of competency in working with gifted learners. As more training programs are occurring worldwide with American or English-speaking consultants, it raises the question of the extent to which outcomes are able to be documented in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162353212471451">
<title>Organizational models of effectiveness and efficiency at the classroom and school level</title>
<p>Questions of interest can be easily developed to ascertain the variables that make programs and curricula for the gifted effective in particular contexts. What are the support structures that teachers must use at the classroom level? What variables impact student achievement at the school level? Do these variables change, given the nature of the learner? These organizational features are worthy of deeper study to ensure that the context for innovation is in place to run successful gifted programs and classroom practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0162353212471451">
<title>Affective and conative qualities (e.g., grit, resilience) in the gifted</title>
<p>The exploration of psychological variables that impact gifted students and their families are of high interest to researchers around the world. Using various models of development and nonintellective constructs like motivation, self-esteem, and resilience, we can learn about differences between cultures and within gifted groups related to how these constructs are working in their lives at different stages of development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0162353212471451">
<title>An analysis of gifted policy in various countries on identification and programming</title>
<p>As new countries design and develop programs for the gifted, it becomes important to analyze the policies that are in place to guide the continued growth and development of such programs. The extent of such policies, the policy language and its implications for program direction, and the barriers encountered in implementation of programs would be good to examine in multiple countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162353212471451">
<title>Longitudinal research that focuses on the critical variables that matter in impacting the lives of students from poverty in positive ways</title>
<p>The world is full of poverty, a key cultural variable that impacts educational attainment and achievement in both the developed and developing world. We need to conduct studies that allow us to see how the effects of poverty impact on the trajectory of success for these learners and what interventions have the most positive benefit on them at key stages of development.</p>
<p>Finally, the following considerations may be used to judge cross-cultural research in the field of gifted education:</p>
<list id="list2-0162353212471451" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Does the study provide validation to existing theories, models, and research studies?</italic> There is a need to ensure that cross-cultural research is grounded in an existing conceptual framework in gifted education that has been studied in at least one culture to demonstrate its efficacy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Does the study advance and deepen our understanding of gifted students and/or their education</italic>? Good cross-cultural research should provide the field of gifted education with new insights that could not be obtained from using only one sample in one cultural framework.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Does the study demonstrate promising results that could be replicated in other cultures?</italic> As more countries develop gifted programs, they will want to create research agendas that demonstrate the efficacy of their work. By doing cross-cultural research, they can provide results that can help other new efforts to flourish.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Does the study support or refute the universality of theories, concepts, and practices?</italic> Most countries, especially those that are multicultural, are very interested in understanding how ideas translate across language and cultural barriers. Cross-cultural research may be in a position to address this important question and provide greater nuance to our understanding of cultural issues in the education of the gifted.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section11-0162353212471451">
<title>A Case Study of Cross-Cultural Research</title>
<p>Involvement in cross-cultural collaboration can be important and meaningful for participants beyond just the research findings. A project conducted between the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Singapore and the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Center for Gifted Education at William and Mary from 2002 to 2005 resulted in three published articles and three international conference presentations on findings. Graduate students involved in the project became published as a result of the study, and one faculty member was promoted, partially based on her work on the study. Resource trading between the university and the ministry in Singapore occurred, resulting in deep connections across the two agencies to promote future collaborative efforts. The study also produced interest in other cultures to use the main instrument, The Classroom Observation Scale–Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212471451">VanTassel-Baska et al., 2003</xref>) used in the Singapore study to judge teacher differentiation strategies. Faculty in selected secondary gifted schools in each culture contributed their interpretation to the results and used them as a basis for self-assessment on the instrument.</p>
<p>Thus, outcomes from such work can be an important first step in promoting positive growth for all involved and enhancing the opportunities for further studies.</p>
<sec id="section12-0162353212471451">
<title>How Do We Establish an Ongoing Research Agenda for Cross-Cultural Collaboration?</title>
<p>Most university-based centers in education have a well-articulated research agenda, which serves as a fundamental part of the mission. A research agenda derived consensually by a group of people committed to such issues is important, especially when the educational issues of interest need concerted attention in respect to providing data on solving difficult problems or setting new directions or developing policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212471451">Bhattacharyya, 1998</xref>). Such an agenda should focus on theoretical and methodological criteria as well as on the applied substance of the research.</p>
<p>An educational research agenda may also be perceived as the catalyst for positive change, identifying various actors as causal agents in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212471451">Popkewitz, 1997</xref>). Entire fields, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) and nursing have coalesced a set of research questions derived from leaders. Those questions provide a focus for prospective researchers as well as a basis for program improvement for funding agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212471451">Bradley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212471451">National Clearinghouse for ESL Literacy Education, 1998</xref>). Sometimes, institutions that are somewhat vulnerable by virtue of their population of interest within a societal context also benefit from a highly integrated research orientation that promotes coherent fund-raising opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212471451">Swygert, 1998</xref>). The gifted may be one such population. In an attempt to facilitate meaningful research, higher education groups have recommended university collaboration with public and private sectors to prioritize the research needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212471451">Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In a cross-cultural research agenda, it is critical to establish 5-year goals for the work that would include multiple studies to be carried out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0162353212471451">
<title>The Goals of a Research Plan</title>
<p>The goals of a research plan are as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0162353212471451" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To document intended research projects;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To ensure a systematic and continuous research effort despite changes in funding, personnel, or other circumstances during the years;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To provide graduate students with a direction for activity;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To provide baseline and progress assessments of research accomplishments; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To exchange research ideas with colleagues internationally.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0162353212471451">
<title>Strategies to Meet the Goals</title>
<p>In light of the goals listed above, the following strategies are suggested:</p>
<list id="list4-0162353212471451" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Share the plan with faculty members and graduate students for review, feedback, comment, and suggestions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Share the finalized plan with current and incoming graduate students to enlist their involvement in the projects that are related to their interest;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Draw on the expertise of interested faculty members in the process of designing and conducting the research projects;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conduct periodic assessment of research efforts against the plan to assess progress and needs for revision or update; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exchange research ideas through national and international conferences.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0162353212471451">
<title>Timelines</title>
<p>The overall plan should encompass multiple years. The plan describes research projects for both short-term and long-term duration, depending on the nature of the research project. For instance, the projects on social studies curricula were ongoing over a few years as the development and implementation of the curriculum units evolved. With regard to activities of the Center that have been going on for some time, research projects based on available cohort groups of potential participants may be launched and concluded sooner. Most projects will take 3 years or more to complete.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0162353212471451">
<title>Resource Allocation</title>
<p>The projects listed in a research plan should be carried out mainly by teams of faculty, staff, and graduate students who are capable of addressing the research questions and applying the methodology. The team formation is to be decided in accordance with personal interests, workloads, and availability. The faculty consultants for each project are to be determined by their relevant expertise, time, and willingness to be involved. The funding for each project will come from existing budgets and relevant external grants. Each country, and centers in each context, should develop a viable plan that promotes a synergy in conducting research that will impact practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0162353212471451">
<title>Collaborative Publications</title>
<p>Appropriate attribution for academic and scholarly work conducted cross-culturally is an important aspect of the process to be considered before these projects are solidified and started. The policy should include publications that include journal articles, book chapters, books, curriculum products, annotated bibliographies, and other reports developed as a result of the study. A similar model may be developed to decide on conference presentations that feature the results of the study as well.</p>
<p>Contributions to a publication that warrants authorship will be judged according to the following criteria:</p>
<list id="list5-0162353212471451" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>intellectual contribution to the overall research and development effort,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>level and extent of writing done,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>analysis of data with appropriate procedures described and tables, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>write-up of publishable literature review relevant to the study.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Participation in on-site data collection and/or involvement in data entry or aggregation does not automatically warrant inclusion in the development of articles for publication. Any guidelines for publishing research should comply with the American Educational Research Association(AERA) model. Other types of publication should consider the ideas presented in this article for collaborative credit.</p>
<p>Order of names in a publication (first author, second author, etc.) will be determined by group consensus of the authors involved based on a Likert-type scale assessment that lists the criteria to be considered. For work on the literature review or data analysis only, typically second, third, or fourth authorship may be warranted based on ongoing involvement with the work. In the event that <italic>all</italic> collaborators are judged to have contributed equally, names will be listed in alphabetical order and noted in an appropriate footnote.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment should be given to all students, stuff, and/or faculty who have contributed to the development research and other products of the Center, even if their specific contribution is not distinguishable at a given point in time (e.g., data entry or analysis that has been folded into a larger study) or if they have not participated in the write-up of the study.</p>
<p>Appropriate attribution of work should be given in all public arenas featuring projects that are conducted and published cross-culturally. Funding agencies in each culture as well as involved universities should be cited. Often universities like to create collaboration agreements that allow all parties to understand how the research process will proceed and how publication rights will be handled.</p>
<p>Often research is an afterthought in the establishment of activities related to gifted education. Even at the university level, such an agenda might not be a first priority as teaching demands and other activities might crowd out the time needed to reflect on a strong agenda. Included in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0162353212471451">appendix</xref> is a sample of how to integrate a research agenda into a university Center’s overall strategic plan. It not only demonstrates the needed emphasis but also the balance of types of activities that most university centers undertake.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0162353212471451">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Conducting cross-cultural research is a complex process that usually needs multiple stakeholders in both cultures to be successful. Most important to consider in the process is the importance of the study for advancing the state of the art of gifted education in each culture and the field in general. Deciding on the rules of collaboration also makes the process move more smoothly, especially after results have been derived. The field of gifted education can benefit in important ways from seeing how interventions of both an educational and clinical nature work in world contexts. Research is more likely to occur if there is a formal plan that outlines the studies to be conducted and the proposals for each study. By attending to these issues, we can both bridge research and practice and advance our understanding of giftedness as well.</p>

<title>Activities Developed Around the Mission and Goals</title>
<p>Over the years, the Center for Gifted Education has initiated several activities in accordance with its mission and goals. The activities, the participants in these activities, and the data collected about them form the content, the cohorts, and the database of the research projects presented in this plan. As a point of departure, the major activities in the center are sketched below as they are described in the <italic>Five-Year Strategic Plan for the Center for Gifted Education</italic>.</p>
<list id="list7-0162353212471451" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. Development, implementation, and dissemination of curriculum for high-ability learners</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Since 1990, the Center has been engaged in the development and implementation of curricula for high-ability learners under federal Javits funding and selected foundation enterprises. The units developed and implemented include science, language arts, math, and social studies. All units have undergone extensive research on effectiveness, including piloting, field testing, and implementation results in respect to student learning and the processes necessary for successful replication. The science units were recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for being one of the top nine programs nationally for enhancing student learning. All subject areas and selected units have received exemplary awards from the U.S. National Association for Gifted Children for their differentiation and effectiveness with gifted learners and teachers.</p>
<list id="list8-0162353212471451" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. Saturday/Summer Enrichment Program for Gifted Learners (SEP)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Saturday/Summer Enrichment Program for gifted learners offers enrichment opportunities for students entering preschool through Grade 10. Courses allow able students to explore specialized areas of science, mathematics, and humanities within appropriate age and ability expectations. Behaviors fostered by the enrichment program include students’ abilities to apply process skills used in individual fields of inquiry, recognize problems and approaches to problem solving, understand and appreciate individual differences, and become self-directed learners.</p>
<list id="list9-0162353212471451" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. Focusing on the Future: Career and Academic Planning Conference for High-Ability Students</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Begun in 1997, Focusing on the Future offers a 1-day workshop on career awareness and academic planning for high-ability students in Grades 6 to 12 and their parents. This program is designed to encourage gifted students to explore possible careers of interest, to establish opportunities for interaction with professionals in these fields, and to inform parents of considerations and guidelines for academic planning that will support career choice. This program has been recognized by the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor for its unique approach to parent education and evaluation through the National School-to-Work Office.</p>
<list id="list10-0162353212471451" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. Project STAR: Student Task Assessments and Rubrics</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Project STAR was funded by the state of South Carolina across 8 years for the purpose of creating a set of performance tasks and rubrics that can be used to identify minority gifted children as an alternative to traditional norm-referenced aptitude and achievement measures. The instruments developed include equivalent forms of primary and intermediate measures on verbal and nonverbal (quantitative and spatial) performance domains. The instruments have gone through try-out, pilot-test, and field-test phases with revisions after each phase. The state of South Carolina has adopted the Project Star protocols, and the Center has conducted a study of 3 years of statewide implementation.</p>
<list id="list11-0162353212471451" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5. Program Evaluation and Program Curriculum Reviews</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Center has been involved, upon request, in both state and local levels of program evaluations. The completed evaluations included two statewide evaluations of gifted programs and the evaluation of local gifted programs in selected districts.</p>
<list id="list12-0162353212471451" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>6. Research studies on curriculum effectiveness, teacher quality, and assessment</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Center has developed a research agenda that annually includes 22 or more research studies actively going on with graduate students, staff, and selected faculty. These studies may be individual or collaborative. Cross-cultural research is encouraged.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Although the intracellular molecular clocks that regulate circadian (~24 h) behavioral rhythms are well understood, it remains unclear how molecular clock information is transduced into rhythmic neuronal activity that in turn drives behavioral rhythms. To identify potential clock outputs, the authors generated expression profiles from a homogeneous population of purified pacemaker neurons (LN<sub>v</sub>s) from wild-type and clock mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They identified a group of genes with enriched expression in LN<sub>v</sub>s and a second group of genes rhythmically expressed in LN<sub>v</sub>s in a clock-dependent manner. Only 10 genes fell into both groups: 4 core clock genes, including <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>), and 6 genes previously unstudied in circadian rhythms. The authors focused on one of these 6 genes, <italic>Ir</italic>, which encodes an inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel likely to regulate resting membrane potential, whose expression peaks around dusk. Reducing <italic>Ir</italic> expression in LN<sub>v</sub>s increased larval light avoidance and lengthened the period of adult locomotor rhythms, consistent with increased LN<sub>v</sub> excitability. In contrast, increased <italic>Ir</italic> expression made many adult flies arrhythmic and dampened PER protein oscillations. The authors propose that rhythmic <italic>Ir</italic> expression contributes to daily rhythms in LN<sub>v</sub> neuronal activity, which in turn feed back to regulate molecular clock oscillations.</p>

<p>Forward genetic screens in mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have revealed a conserved mechanism for the molecular clocks that operate in key central brain pacemaker neurons to generate circadian (~24 h) rhythms in behavior and physiology. These molecular clocks consist of interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops that drive circadian rhythms in gene expression (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730412455918">Hardin, 2011</xref>). At the cellular level, circadian pacemaker neurons have electrical activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412455918">Michel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748730412455918">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730412455918">Cao and Nitabach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730412455918">Sheeba et al., 2008</xref>). These are presumably regulated by the molecular clock since the period of the firing rate of mammalian pacemaker neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is altered in clock gene mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730412455918">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730412455918">Herzog et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>However, direct links between the molecular clock and neuronal activity have proved elusive despite various channels being implicated in pacemaker neuron activity. For example, SCN firing frequency rhythms are likely regulated by BK/Kcnma1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, and by the Kv3.1/Kcnc1 and Kv3.2/Kcnc2 fast-delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412455918">Itri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412455918">Meredith et al., 2006</xref>). Mice lacking either BK or both Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 display weakened behavioral rhythms, although no altered periods were seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412455918">Meredith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730412455918">Kudo et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>BK</italic> RNA levels are rhythmic in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730412455918">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). Kv3.1 and 3.2 protein levels are also rhythmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412455918">Itri et al., 2005</xref>), although the mechanism has not been established. However, the SK channel may be more important than BK in the subgroup of Per+ SCN neurons that show dramatic daily changes in their resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730412455918">Belle et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the diversity of clock neurons in the SCN may have obscured the identification of clock-regulated outputs. Therefore, we decided to generate whole-genome expression profiles from a homogeneous group of pacemaker neurons.</p>
<p>We chose to study the ventral lateral neurons (LN<sub>V</sub>s) from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The adult small LN<sub>V</sub>s (s-LN<sub>V</sub>s) are the master circadian pacemaker neurons since they set the pace for other clock neurons and for locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748730412455918">Stoleru et al., 2005</xref>). We purified LN<sub>v</sub>s from larval brains for 3 main reasons: (1) The 4 larval LN<sub>v</sub>s in each brain lobe are differentiated neurons with functional molecular clocks and become the adult s-LN<sub>v</sub>s. (2) Larval LN<sub>v</sub>s modulate circadian rhythms in light avoidance, which peaks at dawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730412455918">Mazzoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412455918">Collins et al., 2012</xref>) just as s-LN<sub>v</sub>s drive morning activity in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730412455918">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412455918">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that larval LN<sub>v</sub>s are functionally similar to adult s-LN<sub>v</sub>s. (3) The neuropeptide Pigment dispersing factor (PDF) distinguishes LN<sub>v</sub>s from other clock neurons. However, in adult flies, PDF is also produced in the large LN<sub>v</sub>s (l-LN<sub>v</sub>s), which regulate sleep and arousal rather than circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730412455918">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730412455918">Shang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730412455918">Sheeba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730412455918">Chung et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, we used <italic>Pdf-Gal4</italic> to mark larval LN<sub>v</sub>s and purified a homogeneous population of circadian pacemaker neurons for expression profiling, with the idea that genes expressed in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s would also likely be expressed in adult s-LN<sub>v</sub>s.</p>

<title>Isolation of Larval Neurons</title>
<p>For GeneChips, third instar larvae were kept in a standard LD (light:dark) cycle and dissections centered around ZT3 or ZT15 (ZT: zeitgeber time in a 12:12 h LD cycle; lights-on at ZT0, lights-off at ZT12). Approximately 200 brains were dissected for each biological replicate, which took ~90 min. Thus, cells were isolated from a narrow time range, rather than precisely at ZT3 or ZT15. For qPCR, larvae were taken from constant darkness (DD) and ~50 brains dissected per replicate. Brains were transferred to Schneider’s Insect Medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in nonstick tubes (Neptune Scientific, San Diego, CA) on ice to minimize gene expression changes. Brains were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dissociated as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748730412455918">Wegener et al. (2004)</xref> by transferring to a 50:50 mix of 1× Collagenase (Sigma):1× Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and incubating for 2 h at 25 °C. After 2 h, the dissociation solution was replaced with Schneider’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Brains were triturated 100× with a pipette and strained through a 35-µm nylon mesh filter. Trypan blue exclusion indicated that &gt;90% cells were viable after dissociation. Cells in Schneider’s medium/10% FBS were kept on ice for transport to the NYU Medical School FACS center. We used a size filter to remove cell clusters to minimize contamination by cells attached to GFP+ cells. We only selected cells 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more fluorescent than most other cells. Cells were sorted directly into Arcturus PicoPure Total RNA extraction buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). We analyzed RNA from 750 to 1100 LN<sub>v</sub>s for GeneChips, 1000 or 10,000 GFP+ neurons for Elav GeneChips, and 200 to 300 LN<sub>v</sub>s for qPCR.</p>

<title>RNA Amplification and Analysis</title>
<p>For GeneChips, mRNA was amplified using the NuGen Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) and labeled single-stranded DNA hybridized to Affymetrix <italic>Drosophila</italic> 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization, staining, and washing were as in the manufacturer’s protocol. The entire procedure was performed 3 times each for each genotype (<italic>Pdf-Gal4; UAS-CD8::GFP</italic> larvae at ZT3 and ZT15 and <italic>per<sup>0</sup>; PDF-RFP</italic> and <italic>Pdf-RFP; cyc<sup>0</sup></italic> larvae at ZT15).</p>
<p>For quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we used an amplification strategy (WT-Ovation Pico System; NuGEN) optimized for smaller amounts of input total RNA to generate ~5 µg of single-stranded amplified unlabeled cDNA product. For each qPCR reaction, 20 ng cDNA was amplified in a Roche LightCycler. RNA levels were determined by comparing when the reaction moved into the detectable exponential phase to standard curves for each primer set constructed by reamplifying known quantities of PCR products. We normalized the absolute level of each gene in an experiment to RNA levels of <italic>Pdf</italic> (a noncycling transcript). The qPCR results are an average of 2 to 3 independent experiments. For each time series plotted, the maximum value was set to 1. Primer sequences are given in the Supplementary Online Material.</p>

<title>GeneChip Data Analysis</title>
<p>Raw hybridization intensities from each CEL Affymetrix file (<italic>Drosophila</italic> 2.0 GeneChip) were analyzed using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and the accompanying bioinformatic toolbox. For the initial processing step, we used the gcrma algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730412455918">Irizarry et al., 2003</xref>), which incorporates a measure of nonspecific hybridization to compute an adjusted perfect match (aPM) intensity for each probe. The aPMs were then quantile-normalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730412455918">Irizarry et al., 2003</xref>) across replicates and experiments to yield a single expression measure for each probe set.</p>
<p>We removed low-intensity value probe sets (lowest 20th percentile) prior to testing for differential expression, and a second filter removed probe sets showing minimal variance across all conditions (lowest 20th percentile). Nonspecific filtering when profiling homogeneous tissue reduces noise introduced by the large numbers of nonexpressed and underexpressed genes and thus improves sensitivity for detecting truly differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730412455918">Blalock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730412455918">Calza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730412455918">Keegan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Differential expression was determined using statistical analysis of variance (permuted Student <italic>t</italic> test) adjusted for multiple-hypothesis testing. To estimate the false discovery rate, we followed the procedure introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730412455918">Storey and Tibshirani (2003)</xref> to compute q-values and the positive false discovery rate FDR (pFDR). We applied cutoffs for differentially expressed genes of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and FDR &lt;8%. For genes meeting these statistical criteria, we further imposed fold change cutoffs: 8-fold for enrichment and 2-fold for time dependence or clock regulation. Correlations between the 3 replicates for each condition were as follows with numbers indicating highest and lowest correlations: ZT3 (0.92-0.88), ZT15 (0.91-0.88), <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> (0.95-0.92), <italic>cyc<sup>0</sup></italic> (0.94-0.87), and Elav (0.89-0.87).</p>

<title>Behavioral Analysis</title>
<p>To assay larval light avoidance, we followed the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730412455918">Mazzoni et al. (2005)</xref> in which 15 larvae roam for 15 min on a 1% agar surface in a Petri dish. We used a light box with a fluorescent tube lighting the assay plate from below that is blocked from transmitting to half the Petri dish by nontranslucent dividers placed between the light source and assay plates. Light intensity was reduced to 30 lux by increasing the distance of the plates from the light source using these dividers and adding neutral transmittance filters (Roscolux #397: pale gray). Larvae on both sides were counted after 15 min. Four plates were run in parallel. Each data point is the mean of 12 plates.</p>
<p>For adult circadian assays, adult flies were placed in TriKinetics locomotor assay cuvettes (TriKinetics, Waltham, MA) and entrained to LD cycles for at least 3 days prior to shifting to constant darkness (DD) for at least 7 days.

The power of the rhythm is the height in arbitrary units of the periodogram peak, which quantifies the rhythm strength and is only reported for flies meeting the significance threshold (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Visual inspection of actograms was also used to determine percent rhythmic flies.</p>

<p>Before examining differences in gene expression in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s between ZT3 and ZT15, we wanted to validate the procedure. We compared LN<sub>v</sub> gene expression profiles with those from a heterogeneous group of larval brain neurons that produce the postmitotic marker Elav to identify mRNAs whose expression was “enriched” in LN<sub>v</sub>s compared with Elav+ neurons. <italic>Pdf</italic> was the most highly enriched transcript in LN<sub>v</sub>s: 610-fold more abundant at ZT15 in LN<sub>v</sub>s than in Elav+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455918">Figure 1</xref> and Suppl. Table S1A). The core clock genes <italic>per, tim, vrille</italic> (<italic>vri</italic>), and <italic>PAR-domain protein 1</italic> (<italic>Pdp1</italic>) were all in the top 130 enriched mRNAs at ZT15 (close to their peak expression time) with FDR &lt;8%, <italic>p</italic> values (<italic>t</italic> test) &lt; 0.01, and &gt;8-fold enrichment. The inclusion of these genes indicates that the LN<sub>v</sub> purification and RNA amplification method works well. Applying these cutoffs, we identified 95 and 153 mRNAs enriched in LN<sub>v</sub>s at ZT3 and ZT15, respectively (Suppl. Table S1), with 57 mRNAs enriched at both time points.</p>
<p>An alternative strategy involving manual picking of <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock neurons was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730412455918">Nagoshi et al. (2010)</xref>.

<title>GeneChips Identify Transcripts Whose Levels Are Time Dependent in LN<sub>v</sub>s</title>
<p>Since CLK/CYC-regulated transcripts are low in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s at ZT3 (early morning) and high at ZT15 (early evening), we compared LN<sub>v</sub> expression profiles at these times. As expected, expression of the core clock genes <italic>per, tim, vri</italic>, and <italic>Pdp1</italic> was higher at ZT15 than at ZT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455918">Figure 1D</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455918">E</xref> and Suppl.

Eighty-seven percent (161/195) of these mRNAs are not enriched transcripts and are presumably expressed broadly in the larval brain as well as in a time-dependent manner in LN<sub>v</sub>s. Only 11 of the 195 time-dependent genes we identified in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s (including <italic>per, tim, vri</italic>, and <italic>Pdp1</italic>) are among the rhythmic genes identified by meta-analyses of the multiple whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> head microarray studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748730412455918">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730412455918">Keegan et al., 2007</xref>), validating the purification of LN<sub>v</sub>s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730412455918">Kula-Eversole et al.

<title>A Subset of Time-Dependent LN<sub>v</sub> Genes Is Also Clock Regulated</title>
<p>Rhythmically expressed genes could be driven by LD cycles rather than by the molecular clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748730412455918">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>). To distinguish light-regulated from clock-regulated genes, we isolated LN<sub>v</sub>s from <italic>per</italic> and <italic>cyc</italic> null mutants since they have opposite molecular clock effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730412455918">Hardin, 2011</xref>). Therefore, if any of the 195 time-dependent mRNAs are clock regulated, their expression should differ between <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>cyc<sup>0</sup></italic> larval LN<sub>v</sub>s. Applying the same cutoffs as for ZT3 versus ZT15, we identified 177 clock-regulated mRNAs whose expression differs between <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>cyc<sup>0</sup></italic> LN<sub>v</sub>s (Suppl. Table S3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455918">Figure 1D</xref>). Twenty-four mRNAs have both time-dependent (ZT3 vs. ZT15) and clock-regulated expression (<italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> vs. <italic>cyc<sup>0</sup></italic>), which we term <italic>clock driven</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455918">Figure 1D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455918">E</xref>).

<p>Two surprising omissions from the clock-driven list are <italic>cry</italic> and <italic>Clk. cry</italic> expression was more highly enriched at ZT3 than at ZT15 but did not meet the statistical cutoffs for time dependency. This may reflect its delayed time to reach peak levels in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s since, as described below, qPCR from isolated LN<sub>v</sub>s revealed higher <italic>cry</italic> RNA levels at CT10 than at CT4 in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s (CT: circadian time: time in DD after prior LD cycles). Thus, our list of clock-driven LN<sub>v</sub> transcripts is presumably incomplete for this reason and because other transcripts (such as <italic>Clk</italic>) are lowly expressed and/or difficult to amplify. The lack of overlap between genes showing time-dependent and clock-dependent expression is also surprising and remains to be fully explained. Interestingly, <italic>per, tim, vri</italic>, and <italic>Pdp1</italic> are the only overlap between the 24 clock-driven genes in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s and the ~100 genes with circadian expression identified by a meta-analysis of multiple whole head microarray studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748730412455918">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Circadian Gene Expression Profiles</title>
<p>To validate the GeneChip data, we focused on genes whose expression is clock driven and enriched.

<p>Supplementary Figure S1 shows the expression profiles for 9 of the genes that are both clock driven and enriched as well as for <italic>Pdf</italic>, a noncycling enriched gene.

<title>Altered Expression of <italic>Ir</italic> in LN<sub>v</sub>s Affects Circadian Behavior</title>
<p>Clock-driven oscillations in <italic>Ir</italic> expression could be one mechanism by which LN<sub>v</sub>s generate circadian rhythms in excitability since inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels regulate resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730412455918">Hille, 2001</xref>). More inward rectifiers at the cell membrane should increase K<sup>+</sup> efflux, hyperpolarizing the cell, while decreased Ir levels should decrease K<sup>+</sup> efflux and depolarize the cell. The temporal profile of <italic>Ir</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412455918">Figure 2A</xref>) is consistent with electrophysiological measurements of adult s-LN<sub>v</sub>s, which become progressively depolarized toward the end of the night when <italic>Ir</italic> expression is low and then hyperpolarize again after dawn when <italic>Ir</italic> RNA levels begins to rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730412455918">Cao and Nitabach, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We first tested a role for <italic>Ir</italic> in LN<sub>v</sub> function using larval light avoidance. In this assay, larvae are placed in the middle of a Petri dish half exposed to light and the number of larvae on the dark side is counted 15 min later. Wild-type larvae show a robust preference for the dark side, with ~70% in the dark after 15 min at bright light. LN<sub>v</sub>s are downstream of the larval visual system, and their neuronal activity rapidly increases with light exposure. This response is elevated when LN<sub>v</sub>s are made hyperexcitable by expressing <italic>NaChBac</italic>, a low-threshold voltage-gated sodium channel from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748730412455918">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Altered <italic>Ir</italic> Expression in Adult LN<sub>v</sub>s Changes Circadian Locomotor Activity</title>
<p>One reason for profiling larval LN<sub>v</sub>s was to identify key genes expressed in adult s-LN<sub>v</sub>s without co-purifying l-LN<sub>v</sub>s. To test a role for <italic>Ir</italic> in adult LN<sub>v</sub>s, we measured the locomotor activity rhythms of flies with <italic>Pdf-Gal4</italic> expressing <italic>UAS-Ir:RNAi</italic>. These flies had strong 25.0-h-long period locomotor rhythms in DD compared with control flies with periods between 23.6 and 24.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412455918">Figure 3C</xref>, Suppl. Table S4). Long-period behavioral rhythms are also seen when LN<sub>v</sub>s are hyperexcited via <italic>UAS-NaChBac</italic>, which leads to a 25.5-h behavioral period and complex behavioral rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730412455918">Nitabach et al., 2006</xref>), or via <italic>UAS-dnATPase</italic>, a dominant-negative Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730412455918">Sun et al., 2001</xref>; Suppl. Table S4). The similar period phenotypes of flies with <italic>Pdf-Gal4</italic> expressing <italic>UAS-Ir:RNAi, UAS-NaChBac</italic>, or <italic>UAS-dnATPase</italic> are consistent with decreased <italic>Ir</italic> expression increasing LN<sub>v</sub> excitability and further support the idea that <italic>Ir</italic> levels regulate LN<sub>v</sub> excitability.</p>
<p>A similar long period rhythm was observed when <italic>Ir-RNAi</italic> was expressed in all adult clock neuron groups using the <italic>tim(UAS)-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412455918">Figure 3C</xref>, Suppl. Table S4). This was surprising because <italic>tim(UAS)-Gal4</italic> usually gives stronger phenotypes than <italic>Pdf-Gal4</italic>. Indeed, hyperexciting all clock neurons with <italic>tim(UAS)-Gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS-NaChBac</italic> makes flies arrhythmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412455918">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). This suggested that <italic>Ir</italic> might not play a role in other clock neurons. To test this, <italic>UAS-Ir:RNAi</italic> was expressed in all clock neurons except LN<sub>v</sub>s, using the <italic>tim(UAS)-Gal4</italic> driver and a <italic>Pdf-Gal80</italic> transgene to inhibit Gal4 activity in LN<sub>v</sub>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412455918">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412455918">Figure 3C</xref> and Supplemental Table S4 show that flies in which <italic>Ir:RNAi</italic> was restricted to non-LN<sub>v</sub> clock neurons have normal circadian rhythms. This also contrasts with expressing NaChBac in non-LN<sub>v</sub> clock neurons, which dramatically constricts the time when flies are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412455918">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, <italic>Ir</italic> does not seem to regulate non-LN<sub>v</sub> clock neurons and is perhaps not expressed in non-LN<sub>v</sub>s.</p>
<p>To test where <italic>Ir</italic> is expressed, we used a Gal4 enhancer trap inserted in <italic>Ir</italic> (NP2554, hereafter referred to as <italic>Ir<sup>Gal4</sup></italic>). <italic>Ir-Gal4</italic> flies were crossed to a <italic>UAS-nuclear-YFP</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730412455918">Kimura, 2005</xref>). Brains were dissected at ZT15 and stained for YFP, PDF to mark LN<sub>v</sub>s and VRI to mark all clock neurons. Nuclear YFP was detected in all 4 adult PDF+ s-LN<sub>v</sub>s and 2 to 3 of the 5 l-LN<sub>v</sub>s but not in the fifth PDF– s-LN<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412455918">Figure 3D</xref>). We detected YFP in 1 of the 6 LN<sub>d</sub>s (dorsal lateral neurons) but in none of the three dorsal neuron (DN) groups. The relatively broad expression of <italic>Ir-Gal4</italic> in the brain is consistent with <italic>Ir</italic> being one of only 3 inward rectifier channels in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome and underlines the importance of purifying LN<sub>v</sub>s prior to expression profiling to detect rhythmic <italic>Ir</italic> expression. Although this <italic>Ir<sup>Gal4</sup></italic> enhancer trap line might not precisely reflect <italic>Ir</italic> expression, the pattern is consistent with our genetic data indicating that s-LN<sub>v</sub>s are the locus where <italic>Ir</italic> acts in circadian rhythms. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730412455918">Nagoshi et al.

The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730412455918">Figure 4C</xref>,D show that peak PER protein levels at CT23 are reduced in <italic>Ir<sup>d</sup></italic> flies (<italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Taking these data together with the modest period lengthening in <italic>Ir:RNAi</italic> flies leads us to propose that <italic>Ir</italic> is not just a clock output but, by affecting LN<sub>v</sub> excitability, feeds back to regulate the molecular clock.</p>

<title>Expression Profiling of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pacemaker Neurons</title>
<p>There have been relatively few insights into how circadian molecular clocks control pacemaker neuronal activity rhythms. Because circadian rhythms in mRNA levels are widespread across organisms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730412455918">Harmer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730412455918">Storch et al., 2002</xref>), rhythmic expression of output genes that underlie rhythmic neuronal activity is an attractive idea. Our approach to identifying clock-regulated output genes differed from most previous circadian expression profiling studies by starting with a homogeneous population of behaviorally relevant pacemaker neurons. Single-cell type expression profiling is clearly a powerful approach because the vast majority of rhythmically expressed transcripts identified in larval LN<sub>v</sub>s (this study) or adult l-LN<sub>v</sub>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730412455918">Kula-Eversole et al., 2010</xref>) differ from those with rhythmic expression in whole fly heads.</p>

<sec id="section17-0748730412455918">
<title><italic>Ir</italic> Contributes to the Regulation of LN<sub>v</sub> Excitability</title>
<p>We focused on <italic>Ir</italic> because of the well-described roles of inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels in resting membrane potential and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730412455918">Hille, 2001</xref>). As <italic>Ir</italic> transcript levels are high at CT10 and CT16 (around dusk) and low at CT22 and CT4 (around dawn), LN<sub>v</sub>s should be less excitable at dusk than at dawn. This inference correlates with electrophysiological measurements of adult s-LN<sub>v</sub> resting membrane potential, which becomes progressively depolarized toward the end of the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730412455918">Cao and Nitabach, 2008</xref>). Low <italic>Ir</italic> expression in <italic>cyc<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants and high expression in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> mutants are consistent with data indicating that larval LN<sub>v</sub> excitability is high when CLK/CYC activity is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412455918">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). Ultimately, these ideas will require measuring when Ir protein is present and functional. The ~365aa cytoplasmic Ir C-terminus has 63 serines and threonines, suggesting that phosphorylation also regulates Ir activity. Low <italic>Ir</italic> RNA levels in LN<sub>v</sub>s at dawn, and thus high LN<sub>v</sub> excitability, are consistent with LN<sub>v</sub>s promoting (1) larval light avoidance, which peaks around dawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730412455918">Mazzoni et al., 2005</xref>), and (2) the morning peak of adult locomotor activity in LD cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730412455918">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412455918">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). The presence of multiple E boxes (potential CLK/CYC binding sites) in the <italic>Ir</italic> regulatory region (M. Ruben and J. Blau, data not shown), its phase of expression, and the effect of the <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>cyc<sup>0</sup></italic> mutations on <italic>Ir</italic> RNA levels support the idea that <italic>Ir</italic> is a direct CLK/CYC target, although this also remains to be tested.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Ir</italic> is rhythmically expressed in LN<sub>v</sub>s, we propose that other clock neurons have different mechanism(s) to link their molecular clocks to neuronal activity. Larval LN<sub>v</sub>s and DN1s have opposite relationships between CLK/CYC activity and excitability: LN<sub>v</sub>s are most excitable when CLK/CYC activity is low and DN1s are most excitable when CLK/CYC activity is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412455918">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). Cell type–specific clock outputs have already been observed in mammals, where similarly phased molecular clocks lead to rhythmic expression of outputs that differ extensively between tissues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730412455918">Storch et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, we propose that CLK/CYC regulate distinct sets of output genes in different clock neurons.</p>

<title>A Holistic Model for Regulating LN<sub>v</sub> Output</title>
<p>While <italic>Ir</italic> affects circadian behavior, the rhythmic physiology of LN<sub>v</sub>s probably derives from multiple redundant mechanisms, perhaps explaining why forward genetics has revealed little about clock outputs. Our LN<sub>v</sub> GeneChips identify additional clock-driven genes with potential roles in clock output, including <italic>amontillado</italic>, an enzyme that cleaves inactive neuropeptide precursors; <italic>Snap</italic> (<italic>Soluble NSF attachment protein</italic>), which helps recycle synaptic vesicles from the plasma membrane; and <italic>Rdl</italic>, a GABA-activated chloride channel.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to determine how similar the mechanisms for regulating circadian rhythms in excitability are between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. For the SCN, rhythms in excitability can be subdivided into rhythms in resting membrane potential and action potential frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730412455918">Kuhlman and McMahon, 2006</xref>). No channels have yet been identified that regulate SCN membrane potential, but firing frequency is likely regulated by BK, Kv3.1, and Kv3.2 K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412455918">Itri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412455918">Meredith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730412455918">Kudo et al., 2011</xref>). Although mice lacking either BK or both Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 display weakened behavioral rhythms, no altered periods were seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412455918">Meredith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730412455918">Kudo et al., 2011</xref>). However, manipulating the channel(s) that determine resting membrane potential in SCN neurons may change period length because artificially hyperpolarizing SCN slices in vitro with low K<sup>+</sup> either altered period or lead to loss of <italic>mPer1</italic>-luciferase rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412455918">Lundkvist et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting a link between membrane potential and the molecular clock in the SCN. At least for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the period-altering phenotypes with <italic>Ir</italic> knockdown and LN<sub>v</sub> hyperexcitation via NaChBac blur the conventional distinction between clock outputs and inputs.</p>

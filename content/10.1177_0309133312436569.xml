<abstract>
<p>A general framework for modelling morphological responses to perturbation is proposed, based on the underpinning principle that the rates of morphological response in alluvial channels are initially high and then decrease through time as the system relaxes following disturbance. The framework includes three morphological response models, each developed from the fundamental rate law, which has the form of an exponential decay function. These models consider the possibility that characteristic behaviours of the fluvial system, such as delayed response and/or cumulative effects, may affect morphological responses, making them capable of representing relaxation paths and times for a range of morphological response variables, whatever their initial states. To test their utility, the models in the framework were applied to simulate the sequence of geomorphological responses to disruption observed in selected rivers with well-documented histories of morphological perturbation, adjustment and recovery. The results demonstrate that the models in the general framework can successfully simulate temporal and spatial patterns of morphological response in the fluvial system under a range of different circumstances, while also indicating how their reliability could be further improved.</p>

<title>I Background and introduction</title>
<p>There is a rich history of investigation of morphological adjustment in fluvial systems disturbed by, for example, dam construction, channel modification, land-use changes and volcanic eruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312436569">Kasai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133312436569">Leon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309133312436569">Petts and Gurnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133312436569">Rinaldi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133312436569">Simon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133312436569">Urban and Rhoads, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312436569">Williams and Wolman, 1984</xref>). Description and prediction of geomorphic responses in the fluvial system should cover four components of channel change: direction, magnitude, time rate and spatial extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312436569">Knighton, 1998</xref>). Moreover, a pervasive tendency and significant characteristic of natural, geomorphological systems is for morphological adjustments to lag behind changes in process intensity. This occurs, first, due to the time taken for morphology to begin responding to perturbation, which is referred to as reaction time, and, second, due to the time needed for fluvial processes to perform the work necessary for morphological responses to achieve a balanced state between flow, sediment conveyance and channel form through sediment erosion, transfer and deposition, which is termed the relaxation or recovery time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133312436569">Brunsden, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133312436569">Howard, 1982</xref>). This explains why models should allow for the existence of reaction and recovery times, which characterize the behaviour of a fluvial system in terms of delayed response and the time necessary for adjustments to fully absorb the effects of disturbance. In nature, reaction and recovery times are characteristically longer than the return period for events that perturb the fluvial system. It follows that the current morphological state of a fluvial system represents the cumulative effects of all previous disturbances and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Hence, it must be concluded that any comprehensive method or model describing or predicting relaxation paths and times in the fluvial system following disturbance must include the direction, magnitude, rate and extent of geomorphic response. Furthermore, delayed response and/or the cumulative effects of the previous disturbances and conditions, which represent important characteristics of the fluvial system, should also be taken into account when explaining or simulating channel morphologies and adjustments.</p>
<p>Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133312436569">Huang and Nanson (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133312436569">2002</xref>) demonstrated that natural channels adjusted iteratively, with the magnitude of adjustments decaying through time; providing a physical explanation for self-regulatory behaviour in fluvial systems. In this context, the equilibrium condition performs as the attractor state in the evolution of fluvial systems, though it may not necessarily be the actual state that the river achieves once it has relaxed following disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133312436569">Huang and Nanson, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133312436569">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133312436569">Nanson and Huang, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133312436569">Phillips (2010)</xref> argued, however, that the dynamic and variable responses in geomorphology of rivers were just emergent byproducts of fundamental physical mechanisms within them. The steady-state was just a possible state towards which a channel changes, rather than inevitable or normal trends; thus, it should not imply the goal function or attractor state of river evolution. In recognition of multiple potential characteristic or equilibrium forms in the evolution of fluvial systems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133312436569">Phillips (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133312436569">2010</xref>) indicated that responses or adjustments to imposed changes were finite and therefore they were ultimately characterized by relaxation time equilibrium, the weakest form of equilibrium notions, implying that a stream has completed its response to a given disturbance or environmental change. Therefore, in practice, the equilibrium concept or relaxed state associated with the tendency for responses to disturbance that are dominated by negative feedback mechanisms may be taken as an asymptotic or reference state towards which rivers relax in modelling the evolution of fluvial systems.</p>
<p>Thus far, no general, quantitative model describing the relaxation path and timing of channel adjustment has yet emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312436569">Knighton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133312436569">Leon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133312436569">Urban and Rhoads, 2003</xref>). This is partly explained by the complexity of intrinsic and extrinsic process-response mechanisms in the fluvial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312436569">Hey, 1979</xref>), which effectively preclude development of a process-based, deterministic, numerical model capable of simulating morphological responses to disturbance over anything longer than short-term timescales or larger than reach-sized space scales.</p>
<p>As an alternative, a number of conceptual and empirical models have been developed, based on their capability for long-term, system-wide prediction and the relative simplicity of their application. Among these methods, quantitative approaches may be broadly classified as hydraulic geometry analyses, extremal hypotheses and analyses based on various, rational equations.</p>
<p>Hydraulic geometry analyses rely on channel dimensions measured in reaches that are adjusted to the prevailing flow and sediment regimes, which are represented using hydrologic and sediment load records gathered from nearby gauging stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309133312436569">Hey and Thorne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133312436569">Julien and Wargadalam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309133312436569">Li and Simons, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309133312436569">Millar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309133312436569">Santos-Cayade and Simons, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133312436569">Schumm, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133312436569">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309133312436569">Yu and Wolman, 1987</xref>). The resulting equations, usually in the form of power functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133312436569">Leopold et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309133312436569">Wharton, 1995</xref>), can be used to predict the sensitivity of the channel to disturbance and the magnitude and direction of changes in channel dimensions. Most of them, however, apply only to equilibrium conditions and so are incapable of predicting the forms or sequences of transitional geometries displayed by channels that are in disequilibrium as they adjust dynamically to disturbance. In this respect, a conceptual development of regime theory by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312436569">Hey (1979)</xref> sought to account for hydraulic geometry in disequilibrium channels by replacing the flow doing most work through sediment transport with that doing most erosion (in degrading channels) or that doing most deposition (in aggrading channels). While regime-style equations are used extensively and can produce successful outcomes, they suffer several shortcomings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309133312436569">Griffiths, 1984</xref>), including the fact that they are not dimensionally homogenous and that their validity is limited to the basin and data from which they were derived.</p>
<p>Extremal hypotheses have been found useful in generating the additional relationships between independent and dependent variables describing fluvial systems necessary for closing the link between fluvial processes, channel adjustment and equilibrium form. The extremal hypothesis may be expressed in terms of minimum stream power per unit bed area, minimum unit stream power per unit weight, minimum flow resistance and maximum sediment transport capacity, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133312436569">Chang, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133312436569">Davies and Sutherland, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133312436569">Kirkby, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309133312436569">Leopold and Langbein, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309133312436569">White and Bettess, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309133312436569">Yalin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309133312436569">Yang and Song, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309133312436569">Yang et al., 1981</xref>). While multiple extremal hypotheses have been proposed, no theory has emerged to unify them and they have been criticized for lacking a basis in Newtonian physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133312436569">Huang and Nanson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312436569">Knighton, 1998</xref>). Also, satisfaction of an extremal hypothesis strictly applies only in channels that are in equilibrium, which limits their predictive capacity (Qian et al., 1980; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133312436569">Simon and Thorne, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Rational approaches use power law, hyperbolic and exponential equations or relatively complex differential equations to define and predict river channel changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309133312436569">Graf, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309133312436569">May, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309133312436569">Simon, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309133312436569">Thorn and Welford, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312436569">Williams and Wolman, 1984</xref>). A common trait of such models that is widely recognized in nature is that geomorphic systems respond rapidly immediately following disruption, but thereafter exhibit a declining rate of adjustment as a new equilibrium state or a relaxed state is approached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133312436569">Church, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312436569">Knighton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133312436569">Simon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133312436569">Surian and Rinaldi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312436569">Williams and Wolman, 1984</xref>). Consequently, channel response may be described by non-linear decay functions, of which the rate law (an exponential decay function) has been the most widely used to describe relaxation paths and recovery times. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309133312436569">Graf (1977)</xref> investigated gully development in the Colorado Piedmont and found that growth rates decreased exponentially with time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309133312436569">Soufi (2002)</xref> later confirmed this pattern of gully behaviour based on an extensive field survey in Australia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133312436569">Surian and Rinaldi (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133312436569">Leon et al. (2009)</xref> studied bed level adjustments and transient channel slopes in unstable rivers, respectively, and found that trends in both these variables could be approximated by an exponential function. Many studies have shown that channel response to natural and anthropogenic disturbances (such as those caused by dam construction and channelization) can be simulated and predicted by the rate law, using negative exponential equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133312436569">Hooke, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309133312436569">Richard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309133312436569">Simon, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133312436569">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133312436569">Simon and Thorne, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312436569">Williams and Wolman, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on the outcomes of these and other studies, Wu and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309133312436569">Wu et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133312436569">2008b</xref>) developed a method for predicting changes in bankfull cross-sectional area and bankfull discharge in the Lower Yellow River following closure of dams upstream. They found that predictions based on rate law equations were in good agreement with observed data. Based on the long and largely positive history of application of rate law methods, it is believed that Wu et al.’s methodology can be extended to other rivers and situations where the response time plays a key role in accessing channel adjustment to disturbance or environmental change.</p>
<p>In this paper, we seek to establish, for the first time, a general framework for applying the rate law in a variety of fluvial contexts. This framework builds on and advances the approach developed and reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309133312436569">Wu et al. (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133312436569">2008b</xref>). The utility of the proposed framework is tested through application of the equations it contains to simulation of a variety of well-documented geomorphological responses in fluvial systems subject to natural and anthropogenic disruption.</p>

<p>As outlined above, geomorphic adjustment is more intense immediately following disruption, with the rate of change slowing and then becoming asymptotic as a new equilibrium state or a relaxed state is approached. Based on this characteristic of fluvial system, it can be assumed that the rate of adjustment of any morphological variable is proportional to the difference between its value at any time,<italic> t,</italic> and the asymptotic value toward which it is adjusting.

<p>In Model 3, the asymptotic value can vary between time steps to reflect the impact of non-linear, dynamical behaviour in the fluvial system in changing the relaxed condition towards which the channel is adjusting. Consequently, Model 3 is applicable to systems where the relaxed state varies as a complex function of time since disturbance and can account for two important characteristics of natural, fluvial systems: delayed response and the cumulative effects of past disturbances, changing catchment controls and antecedent environmental conditions.</p>

<title>1 Application of Model 1</title>
<p>As mentioned above, versions 1a and 1b of Model 1 are equivalent, differing only in the way in which their integration terms are composed. Hence, the application of either version of Model 1 should indicate that of the other. In this application, Model 1a was selected to simulate the accumulation of sediment in the main stem of the Yellow River and its largest tributary, the Wei River, following closure of Sanmenxia Dam in 1960.</p>
<p>Sanmenxia Dam is the first dam built on the Yellow River main stem, which carries the highest sediment concentration of all the world’s rivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309133312436569">Qian and Dai, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309133312436569">Wu and Wang, 2004</xref>). The heavy sediment load, together with the initial operating scheme, which made no provision for routing or flushing sediment through the reservoir, led to trapping of all the incoming sediment, resulting in a rapid reduction in its capacity and upstream extension of the backwater zone. Modifications were made to the dam between 1964 and 1973 to increase its capacity to discharge sediment with the aim of achieving a balance between sediment inflow and outflow. Consequently, disturbance and recovery in the fluvial system upstream are characterized by complex morphological responses to raising the base level of the river upstream of Sanmenxia Dam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309133312436569">Wang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309133312436569">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309133312436569">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In characterizing temporal changes in base level, the water surface elevation corresponding to a discharge, <italic>Q</italic>, equal to 1000 m<sup>3</sup>/s, gauged at the Tongguan hydrometric station, which is located immediately downstream of the confluence of the Yellow and Wei Rivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309133312436569">Figure 3</xref>), was used as a simple but reliable reference value.

<title>2 Application of Model 2</title>
<p>Model 2a assumes the relaxed state to be constant, while Model 2b assumes that it changes as a linear function of time since disturbance. Actually, the proclivity of fluvial systems to display complex response limits the frequency of situations where a linear change in the relaxed state is likely to occur. Hence, in this study, a suitable example with which to test Model 2b could not be found. However, no matter how the relaxed state may change, it can be simulated if the user divides the recovery period into a series of time steps, each of which is sufficiently short that the potential relaxed state may be assumed to be constant within each time step, so that Model 2a can be applied on a step-by-step basis. In this approach, the adjustment result for each time step provides the initial condition for the next, so that progressive change in the physical variable can be simulated over the recovery period.</p>
<p>Moreover, as mentioned previously, Model 2a is also applicable to cases with a constant relaxed state, where the system is disturbed by transient changes in a controlling variable. Thus, in this study, Model 2a was applied in cases with both constant and variable relaxed states.</p>

<title>a Response of the Colorado River to dam closure</title>
<p>The Hoover and Davis Dams were built on the Colorado River in 1935 and 1948, respectively. As both dams impound large reservoirs with very high trap efficiencies, the reaches downstream have been starved of sediment since closure of these structures and the relatively clear water released from the dams has eroded the channel bed. In this application, construction of the dams was taken to be a transient disruption and the consequent morphological adjustment of channel bed elevation of the Colorado River was simulated using Model 2a.</p>

<title>b Reservoir sedimentation and morphological changes in the Yellow River</title>
<p>To test the applicability of Model 2a in a situation with a variable relaxed state, as illustrated above, Model 2a was applied to simulate relaxation paths for (1) reservoir sedimentation behind Sanmenxia Dam, (2) increases in river elevation at Tongguan hydrometric station, and (3) changes in the bankfull dimensions observed at two cross-sections in the Lower Yellow River.</p>
<p>(1) <italic>Sedimentation in Sanmenxia Reservoir</italic>. When tested, Model 1a was used to simulate sediment accumulation in reaches of Yellow and Wei Rivers affected by backwater effects upstream of the reservoir behind Sanmenxia Dam. This subsection reports the outcome of using Model 2a to simulate sediment deposition in the reservoir between Tongguan and the dam.</p>
<p>Application of Model 2a in situations with a variable relaxed state requires derivation of an equation to calculate the asymptotic value of a morphological parameter closely related to the nature of disruption to the fluvial system. Thus, the first step in applying Model 2a is to identify those physical parameters that primarily responsible for driving morphological response to the particular disturbance being simulated. Then, equations suitable for calculating asymptotic values of the morphological parameters responding to these variables may be developed.</p>
<p>Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309133312436569">Wu et al. (2007)</xref> showed that the discharge flowing into the reservoir and the pool level are the two variables primarily responsible for driving sedimentation in Sanmenxia reservoir.

<p>During the first few years after closure, sedimentation is believed to be less strongly related to the operational mode and pool level than is the case in later years. Thus, data for the period 1960–1968 were not used in this study. Furthermore, the operational regime changed from 1974 onwards to ‘storing the clear water and releasing the muddy water’.

<p>(3) <italic>Bankfull dimensions.</italic> Bankfull discharge and area are principal indicators of the capacity of the main channel of the Lower Yellow River to convey flood flows and transport sediment. As a result of increasing impact of human activities, such as water withdrawal for irrigation and municipal uses, dam construction and land-use changes, sedimentation in the main channel has become ever more serious in the Lower Yellow River, which is perched well above its floodplain. As a consequence, bankfull discharge and area of the Lower Yellow River have decreased dramatically during the last half century.</p>

<title>3 Application of Model 3</title>
<p>There are two versions of Model 3, of which Model 3b may be less reliable than Model 3a because it uses the initial asymptotic value to represent the initial condition in cases where the actual initial condition is unknown. It follows that, if Model 3b can successfully simulate the sequence of adjustments observed in a fluvial system following disturbance, Model 3a would also be able to do so. Consequently, Model 3b was selected for testing through application to the same morphological attributes of the Yellow River that were previously used to test Model 2a (with variable relaxed states). Differences between these two models will be discussed later.</p>

<title>IV Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>A framework for simulating morphological recovery in disturbed fluvial systems has been developed, based on the principle that morphological adjustments occur rapidly immediately after disruption, but that the rate of change decreases with time to become asymptotic as the system relaxes and approaches a new equilibrium or relaxed state. This framework builds on research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309133312436569">Wu et al. (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133312436569">2008b</xref>) to provide a systematic basis for applying the rate law, which has been widely demonstrated to be capable of accurately describing morphological adjustments in the fluvial system.</p>
<p>The framework includes three different models, each developed from the fundamental rate law equation, which has the form of a negative exponential decay function. The basic model (Model 1) is expressed in two versions that differ only with respect to the integration items. The single-step, analytical model (Model 2) also comes in two versions, which allows the user to select an appropriate assumption concerning how the relaxed state changes as a function of time during the recovery period. Inclusion of two versions of the multi-step, analytical model (Model 3) further allows users to apply advanced rate law modelling even in situations where the initial value of the geomorphological variable under consideration is unknown. These three morphological response models facilitate inclusion of characteristic behaviours of the fluvial system such as delayed response and/or the cumulative effects of antecedent and catchment conditions, which can have different effects on the relaxation times and paths displayed by a variety of morphological variables.</p>
<p>To test the applicability and validity of the proposed framework, Models 1a, 2a and 3b were applied to simulate adjustment of selected morphological variables in rivers following natural or anthropogenic disturbance. Relaxation paths for channel bed elevation, the volume of sediment in aggrading reaches, reservoir sedimentation and bankfull dimensions were calculated and compared to observed data. The results demonstrate that the models in the general framework can successfully simulate relaxation paths for a variety of morphological response variables as they adjust to both impulse and step changes in a controlling variable.</p>
<p>A comparison between Model 2a and Model 3b is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309133312436569">Table 1</xref>, as both models were used to simulate the morphological adjustment of the Yellow River. There are two main differences between these two models. First, as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309133312436569">Table 1</xref>, application of Model 2a requires that initial conditions known (i.e. pre-disturbance values are available for <italic>V</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, <italic>Z</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, <italic>Q<sub>b</sub>
</italic>
<sub>0</sub> and<italic> A<sub>b</sub>
</italic>
<sub>0</sub>). Conversely, initial values are not required to apply Model 3b, as they are replaced by estimated asymptotic values. The second difference lies in how dynamical behaviour of the fluvial system is represented in the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0309133312436569">Figure 14</xref>). When applying Model 2a in situations with a variable relaxed state, the value of a variable in each time step is related only to the condition in the preceding time step. However, when applying Model 3b, the number of preceding years over which conditions are considered when calculating a variable’s asymptotic value,<italic> n</italic>, is optimized by maximizing the coefficient of determination for a regression line fitted to a scatter graph of calculated versus observed values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the findings highlight that good agreement between observed and simulated relaxation paths depends crucially on accurate representation of the decay rate, <italic>β,</italic> which governs the rate at which a response variable approaches its asymptotic value. In the applications reported herein, <italic>β</italic> was held constant whereas, in nature, it may vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309133312436569">Thorne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133312436569">Wu et al., 2008b</xref>). It is suggested that the reliability of the models in the framework could be improved through further research on how dynamical behaviour in the fluvial system affects the decay rate.</p>
<p>The findings also demonstrate the key role that accurate representation of the asymptotic value, towards which the variable is adjusting, plays in successful application of the models in the framework. In line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309133312436569">Wu et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133312436569">2008b</xref>), the equilibrium or relaxed state is taken as the reference state in the evolution of fluvial systems, though it is recognized that this may not necessarily be the actual condition that the river achieves once it has relaxed following disturbance. Further research on potential equilibrium states in the fluvial system should be conducted as this may be the possible condition towards which its morphology is relaxing, notwithstanding the facts that the equilibrium condition itself changes as a function of dynamic process-response mechanisms and that the system may not actually attain an equilibrium condition before it is again perturbed.</p>

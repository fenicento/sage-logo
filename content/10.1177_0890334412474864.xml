<sec id="section1-0890334412474864">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Despite the differences in breastfeeding and bottle-feeding, our understanding of how suck-swallow-breathe (SSwB), oxygenation, and heart rate patterns change as the infant ages is based predominantly on bottle-feeding studies. Therefore, this study aimed to measure how SSwB, oxygenation, and heart rate patterns changed during the first 4 months of lactation in term breastfeeding infants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412474864">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Infants less than 1 month postpartum (n = 15) were monitored early in lactation and again later in lactation (2-4 months postpartum). Simultaneous recordings of vacuum, tongue movement, respiration, swallowing, oxygen saturation, and heart rate were made during both nutritive sucking and non-nutritive sucking during breastfeeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412474864">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Infants transferred a similar amount of milk (<italic>P</italic> = .15) over a shorter duration later in lactation (<italic>P</italic> = .04). Compared to early lactation, suck bursts became longer (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), pauses became shorter (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), vacuum levels decreased (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), oxygen saturation increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and heart rate decreased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) later in lactation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334412474864">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>This study confirmed that term infants become more efficient at breastfeeding as they age, primarily by extending their suck bursts and pausing less. Although infants demonstrated satisfactory SSwB coordination during early lactation, they showed a level of adaption or conditioning at later lactation by applying weaker vacuum levels and demonstrating improved cardiorespiratory responses.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Suck-swallow-breathe (SSwB) coordination is an innate reflex in the healthy term infant and is critical for effective feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412474864">1</xref></sup> It is often assumed that the physiology and maturation of breastfeeding patterns are similar to those of bottle-feeding, however, bottle-feeding infants often exhibit lower oxygen saturation and irregular coordination of sucking and breathing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412474864">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412474864"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412474864">4</xref></sup> Therefore, given that the majority of research pertaining to SSwB is based on bottle-fed infants, it is clear that the findings cannot be extrapolated to breastfeeding term infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412474864">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412474864"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412474864">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Key physiological changes that occur both over the course of lactation and within a single breastfeed may influence the coordination of SSwB. The initiation of copious milk secretion occurs 30-40 hours postpartum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412474864">5</xref></sup> such that infant milk transfer increases from less than 100 mL/day on day 1 to between 750 and 800 mL/day by 1 month postpartum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412474864">6</xref></sup> During each breastfeed, milk ejection, triggered by the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary, delivers milk in a transient fashion to the suckling infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412474864">7</xref></sup> Removal of this milk by the infant is thought to occur early in the breastfeed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412474864">8</xref></sup> Consequently, a breastfeed is typically composed of both periods during which the infant removes milk: nutritive sucking (NS), when milk flow rates vary considerably<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412474864">8</xref></sup>; and non-nutritive sucking (NNS), periods devoid of milk flow, when only saliva is swallowed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412474864">9</xref></sup> Therefore, it is likely that SSwB coordination varies as a result of changing milk flow across a breastfeed, and thus, conventional descriptions suggesting that optimal SSwB ratios are 1:1:1 or 2:1:1 are questionable.</p>
<p>One would expect that with maturation, SSwB coordination may change as the infant ages. This hypothesis is certainly reflected in the fact that infant feeding matures from a reflexive process to one of voluntary control during the first year of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412474864">10</xref></sup> Although it has been established that breastfeeding infants become more effective at feeding as they age by reducing their feed duration, the role of vacuum is less clear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412474864">11</xref></sup> Despite Taki et al showing that breastfeeding infants apply similar vacuum levels during the first 6 months postpartum, the influence of both NS and NNS has not been considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412474864">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Feeding studies have consistently shown that during a swallow, breathing is temporarily interrupted, resulting in a decrease in breathing rate and tidal volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412474864">12</xref></sup> Dittrichova et al showed respiratory rates were similar for the first 4 months postpartum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412474864">13</xref></sup> yet how respiratory patterns change within a breastfeed has not been investigated despite the importance of maintaining adequate oxygen saturation levels. Likewise, although oxygen saturation and heart rate levels during breastfeeding have been shown to be superior to those during bottle-feeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412474864">14</xref></sup> it is not known whether the infant achieves this state by regular pausing, and/or interspersing NNS, or by some other mechanism.</p>
<p>Therefore, this study aimed to measure whether breastfeeding infants changed their sucking, swallowing, breathing, oxygenation, and heart rate patterns during the first 4 months postpartum with respect to NS, NNS, and pausing. We proposed that infants would become more efficient at breastfeeding over time as a result of changes in vacuum, and changes in proportions of NS, NNS, and pausing during a feed.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Breastfeeding mother–infant dyads were recruited through the Child and Adolescent Community Health Centre (Oceanic Area Health Service), Perth, Western Australia and via email notification at The University of Western Australia. Infants were required to be healthy, full term (gestational age &gt; 37 wk), and without either breastfeeding difficulties or oral abnormalities. Participants supplied written, informed consent to participate in the study, and ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at The University of Western Australia.</p>
<p>Participants visited the lactation research laboratory at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Perth. Each infant was monitored on 2 occasions, once during early lactation when the infant was less than 1 month postpartum and again in later lactation, between 2 and 4 months postpartum. Synchronized recordings of intra-oral vacuum, tongue movement, respiration, oxygen saturation, and heart rate were made for the entire breastfeed, and milk intake was measured.</p>
<sec id="section9-0890334412474864">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>Submental ultrasound imaging of the infant’s intra-oral cavity was used to determine both tongue action and milk flow during all monitored breastfeeds using a Toshiba SSA-770A/80, Aplio 80 (Tokyo, Japan) ultrasound machine with an endocavity convex transducer (PVT-661VT) and Parker Ultrasonic Gel (Fairfield, New Jersey, USA). This method, described in more detail elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412474864">15</xref></sup> enabled a clear view of the nipple, tongue, hard palate, soft palate, and milk flow into the intra-oral cavity.</p>
<p>Intra-oral vacuum was measured using a small silicone tube (Supplemental Nursing System, Medela AG, Baar, Switzerland) filled with sterile water. One end was placed alongside the mother’s nipple and extended 1-2 mm beyond the tip) and the other end was attached via a silicone tube (650 mm × 4 mm) and a 3-way tap to a pressure transducer (SP854, Memscap, Bernin, France) with disposable clip-on dome (MLA844, AD Instruments, Castle Hill, Australia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412474864">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patterns of respiration and swallowing were measured using respiratory inductive plethysmography (Respitrace QDC, SensorMedics, Yorba Linda, California, USA) from 2 bands attached to the infant, and connected to the Respitrace. One band was secured around the thorax at the level of the nipples and a second around the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus. Oxygen saturation (Sp0<sub>2</sub>) and heart rate were recorded using pulse oximetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412474864">16</xref></sup> (Radical/MasimoSET V4.1) with a pediatric sensor (LNOP YI Multisite) taped to the distal end of the infant’s foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412474864">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>At each assessment, milk intake was determined by weighing the infant before and after breastfeeding using an electronic baby weigh scale (Medela AG, Baar, Switzerland, resolution 2 g, accuracy ± 0.034%). Milk intake (g) was calculated by subtracting the initial weight from the final weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412474864">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Outputs from the ultrasound machine, pressure transducer, respiratory inductive plethysmography, and pulse oximeter were synchronized by LactaSearch, a customized computerized data collection system (LactaSearch, Medela AG, Baar, Switzerland), and recorded using the software package DIAdem (version 11.1, National Instruments, Texas, USA, 2009) with a custom-designed program for offline data analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412474864">19</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0890334412474864">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The breastfeed was divided into suck bursts and pauses. Suck bursts were identified as periods of tongue movement with a cyclic vacuum trace between pauses (tongue resting and a flat vacuum trace). A breath was defined as visualization of both an inspiration and expiration. A swallow was identified as a stable signal on the respiratory trace.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412474864">20</xref></sup> Sucks and pauses were classified as NS if milk flow was observed in the intra-oral cavity; nutritive pausing (NP) if the pause occurred directly after NS; NNS if no milk flow was observed in the intra-oral cavity on ultrasound; and non-nutritive pausing (NNP) for subsequent pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412474864">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412474864">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>For each suck burst, burst type (NS/NNS), peak vacuum (mean minimum pressure, mmHg), baseline vacuum (mean maximum pressure, mmHg), suck rate (sucks/min), respiratory rate (breaths/min), suck burst duration (s), total burst duration (s), heart rate (beats per min), and oxygen saturation (%) were calculated. For each pause, pause type (NP/NNP), mean vacuum, respiratory rate, pause duration, total pause duration, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were calculated. Bursts and pauses (burst order) were sequentially numbered to allow analysis of patterns across the breastfeed. Transfer rates (g/min) were calculated as milk intake divided by the total breastfeed duration.</p>
<p>The number of sucks (S), swallows (Sw), and breaths (B) were counted for all NS and NNS suck bursts. Suck-swallow-breathe ratios were determined by calculating the ratios of S:Sw and B:Sw relative to 1 swallow, and S:B relative to 1 breath.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed using R (version 2.9.0, The R Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2008). The packages nlme (The R Package, 2008) and multcomp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334412474864">21</xref></sup> were used for linear mixed models and general linear hypothesis tests, respectively. Differences were considered significant when <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Summary data are presented as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range).</p>
<p>Milk intake was analyzed using Student’s paired <italic>t</italic> tests after testing for normality using the Shapiro test. All other variables were compared using linear mixed models to take into account the repeated measurements in each breastfeed. Different baselines (intercept only) for each individual were used as the random effect. After inspection of residual plots, models were transformed if necessary.</p>
<p>For transfer rate and feed duration, possible differences between early and later lactation as well as breast order were tested with an interaction term for visit (early/later lactation) and breast (breast 1/breast 2). For peak/baseline vacuums; the number of sucks, swallows, and breaths; SSwB ratios; sucking rates; total burst duration; respiratory rate; oxygen saturation; and heart rate; possible differences between visit and burst type were tested with an interaction term for visit and burst type (NS/NNS/NP/NNP). Milk flow was assessed as a categorical variable (NS/NNS).</p>
<p>General linear hypothesis tests were used to determine whether peak, baseline, and mean pausing vacuums, burst, and total burst duration differed by visit, and whether they differed by burst type. To determine patterns across the breastfeed, for all variables (excluding transfer rate and feed duration), burst order was considered as an additional interaction term, with visit and burst type.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has confirmed that term breastfeeding infants became more efficient at breastfeeding during the first 4 months postpartum, transferring a similar amount of milk from the breast over a shorter period of time by increasing the length of suck bursts and decreasing the time spent pausing. Infants demonstrated satisfactory SSwB coordination during the early postpartum period, however, they showed a level of either adaption or conditioning by applying weaker vacuum levels and demonstrating improved cardiorespiratory responses with age.</p>
<sec id="section25-0890334412474864">
<title>Burst Patterns</title>
<p>Infants increased their breastfeeding efficiency during the first 4 months postpartum by increasing their suck burst durations and reducing pause durations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334412474864">Table 3</xref>). This change resulted in a shorter total feed duration and an increased rate of milk transfer, which supports previous findings related to breastfeeding efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412474864">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412474864">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412474864">23</xref></sup> Elevated heart rates and lower oxygenation in younger infants suggest that at this stage of development, infants may need to pause more during milk removal to maintain adequate oxygenation. It appears that this requirement diminishes with age, enabling the infant to more efficiently breastfeed.</p>
<p>Infants showed clear differences in burst patterns between NS and NNS. The longer suck bursts during NS reflect infants’ adaption to milk flow during milk ejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334412474864">24</xref></sup> Additionally, the older infants spent more time NS compared to NNS, and even less time pausing, and therefore, most of the breastfeed was spent actively removing milk. Despite this finding, oxygenation levels were maintained, indicating that there is a balance between pausing to recover from active sucking and maintaining efficiency.</p>

<title>Vacuum Patterns</title>
<p>In contrast to previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412474864">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412474864">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334412474864">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334412474864"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334412474864">27</xref></sup> we showed all baseline and peak and mean pausing vacuums weakened with age. On the other hand, preterm infants have been shown to exert stronger vacuum with increasing gestational age, although this difference may reflect normal development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334412474864">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334412474864">26</xref></sup> Generally, term infants have demonstrated consistent vacuum levels as they age; however, most of these studies were performed on bottle-fed infants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412474864">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334412474864">27</xref></sup> or they were studies that did not distinguish between NS and NNS during breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412474864">11</xref></sup> Baseline vacuum is thought to be necessary to seal to the breast and position and elongate the nipple in the oral cavity to facilitate milk removal. Peak vacuum is necessary for milk removal and milk clearance. As peak vacuum is applied, milk flows from the nipple, and as the vacuum is released (decreasing strength), milk is cleared from the oral cavity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412474864">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412474864">19</xref></sup> It is possible that the level of vacuum required for both milk removal and clearance is altered with changing maternal and infant factors during lactation. Baseline vacuum might be affected by physical changes of the maternal nipple (increased flexibility, reduced density) that alter the positioning of the nipple,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412474864">19</xref></sup> whereas peak vacuum could be influenced by developmental changes including reducing oral reflex responses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334412474864">28</xref></sup> the size of the oral cavity, mandibular growth, and the ability of the tongue to create a larger intra-oral space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334412474864">29</xref></sup> Further study would be required to assess the influences of these factors on infant sucking.</p>
<p>Ultrasound imaging clearly showed that NNS occurred at various times during the breastfeed, and most commonly at the end of the breastfeed (86% of measured infants). Little NNS at the beginning of the breastfeed indicates that milk ejection probably occurred before the infant latched to the breast and concurs with McNeilly’s measurement of maternal plasma oxytocin peaks prior to breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334412474864">30</xref></sup> Breastfeeding infants have traditionally been described to suck in a biphasic pattern; the first phase (NNS) occurs prior to the initial milk ejection, leading to the second phase (NS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412474864">3</xref></sup> Using this definition, Mizuno et al showed that NNS was significantly stronger than NS during breastfeeding (peak: –96 mmHg vs –74.5 mmHg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412474864">3</xref></sup> In contrast, when observing NNS throughout the breastfeed, we found that peak vacuum was similar between NS and NNS early in lactation, and that NNS became weaker than NS later in lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0890334412474864">Figure 2</xref>). These results contrast with current assumptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412474864">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334412474864">31</xref></sup> and suggest that NNS can occur throughout the breastfeed. However, it is not known how vacuum levels vary with changing levels of milk flow during a breastfeed.</p>

<sec id="section27-0890334412474864">
<title>Suck-Swallow-Breathe Coordination</title>
<p>Suck-swallow-breathe coordination did not change as infants aged in that suck rates, B:Sw ratio, and S:B ratio were similar in early and later lactation, indicating coordination is developed from 2-4 weeks postpartum in term breastfeeding infants. Changes, such as the greater number of sucks, swallows, and breaths during NS, were likely to be a reflection of the longer bursts during milk removal when the infants were older. Previously, it has been assumed that SSwB coordination improves with age, however, this improved coordination has been established mainly in bottle-feeding studies and those assessing preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334412474864">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334412474864">26</xref></sup> Our results indicate that from the early postpartum period onward, coordination is developed in healthy term breastfeeding infants.</p>
<p>It is logical to assume that the ability to rapidly change SSwB coordination in response to fluctuating milk flow will result in more efficient breastfeeding. We certainly found lower S:B, B:Sw, and S:Sw ratios; suck and respiratory rates; and more frequent swallowing during NS compared to NNS. Together with the results of Scheel et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334412474864">32</xref></sup> who showed that bottle-fed preterm infants were able to modify their sucking pattern and SSwB coordination depending on the rate of milk flow, our study supports the notion that breastfeeding infants are capable of adapting SSwB coordination to the rapidly changing flow rates encountered at milk ejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0890334412474864">33</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section28-0890334412474864">
<title>Heart Rate and Oxygenation</title>
<p>Heart rate was higher in younger infants in this study, suggesting that there is a conditioning effect to breastfeeding as the infant ages. Lappi et al also showed heart rate was highest at 6 weeks postpartum and decreased by 6 months during bottle-feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334412474864">34</xref></sup> The authors concluded that increased heart rate was a response to milk removal being a physical task that increases cardiac output to enable optimal sucking, and they suggested that sucking may function as a stimulus for cardiovascular regulation. In this study, since values for both early and later lactation were within a normal clinical range, it is not clear whether the changes reflect a conditioning effect or the general maturation of the infant. We suspect that both these factors are important.</p>
<p>Although heart rate is known to increase during infant feeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334412474864">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334412474864">35</xref></sup> most studies have relied on bottles or pacifiers to measure NNS as a comparison to NS; on the other hand, we measured heart rate during NS and NNS in breastfeeding infants and found that heart rates were higher during NS compared to NNS, especially during the first month postpartum. Our results again indicate that breastfeeding is more demanding during milk removal.</p>
<p>Despite the infants in this study maintaining high oxygenation at all times during early and later lactation, we found oxygenation increased with age. This finding most likely reflects normal maturation, as oxygen saturation during breastfeeding, while sleeping, and while awake has been shown to increase across the first 8 weeks postpartum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0890334412474864">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334412474864">37</xref></sup> Interestingly, we did not detect a decrease in oxygenation during NS despite showing a significant increase in heart rate, suggesting excellent coordination of the infant. These results therefore imply a level of maturity and/or conditioning as the infant ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0890334412474864">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334412474864">37</xref></sup></p>

<title>Patterns during the Breastfeed</title>
<p>We expected to see changes in feeding parameters during the breastfeed as a result of reducing milk flow during a feed, and indeed, suck bursts became shorter, pauses became longer, suck rates became faster, and fewer sucks and swallows per burst were observed for both early and later lactation during the breastfeed. Shorter suck bursts and longer pauses are likely to be indicative of infant satiety, fatigue, and milk availability. Our results support those of others, in which both breastfed infants and expressing mothers remove at least half of their total milk intake/available milk in the first 4 or 5 minutes of either the breastfeed or expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412474864">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334412474864">35</xref></sup> Interestingly, peak vacuum levels remained relatively constant during the breastfeed, whereas baseline and pausing vacuums increased. This finding may indicate that the peak vacuum required to expand the nipple and increase milk duct size within the nipple does not change,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0890334412474864">38</xref></sup> whereas decreasing milk flow during a breastfeed may result in the infant applying a stronger baseline vacuum to elongate the nipple and maintain optimal positioning. The fact that oxygen saturation decreased during the breastfeed may also reflect the infant’s energy required to maintain baseline vacuum. Patterns during the breastfeed are therefore likely to be influenced by changes in milk flow, breast emptying, infant fatigue, and satiety.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study include the small sample size and large age range measured at later lactation. However, the repeated-measures approach enabled researchers to investigate for the first time changes that occurred during the entire breastfeed. Similarly, the study assessed 2 time points during lactation; it is possible that changes in infant maturation may have occurred either prior or subsequent to our measurements. Likewise, the influence of birth mode on SSwB coordination has not been documented. It is not currently possible to measure milk flow from the breast, therefore NS and NNS were classified as a categorical variable (the presence or absence of milk). Future measurement of milk flow rate from the breast would enable milk flow to be assessed as a continuous variable and thereby provide a more detailed understanding of how SSwB coordination may be affected by milk ejection.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Healthy term infants became more efficient at breastfeeding during the first 4 months postpartum. They achieved this increased efficiency primarily by increasing their suck burst duration and decreasing the time spent pausing. Despite infants in the study showing a high level of SSwB coordination in the first month postpartum, they had stronger vacuum levels and higher heart rates during this period compared to later in lactation. We conclude that a level of either conditioning or adaption to breastfeeding occurs over time, which requires further investigation.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Intravenously administered docetaxel is approved for the treatment of various types of cancer. An oral regimen, in combination with ritonavir, is being evaluated in clinical trials. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel are determined by the activity of the metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The effects of these proteins on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were investigated in different mouse models that lack 1 or both detoxifying systems. Docetaxel was given to these mice orally or intravenously with or without a strong CYP3A inhibitor, ritonavir. The data of these 2 preclinical studies were pooled and analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The results of the preclinical studies could be integrated successfully, with only a small difference in residual error (33% and 26%, respectively). Subsequently, the model was used to predict human exposure using allometric scaling and this was compared with clinical trial data. This model led to adequate predictions of docetaxel exposure in humans.</p>

<p>Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane derivative originating from the needles of the European yew tree (<italic>Taxus baccata</italic>). It shows activity against various types of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010397051">1</xref></sup> and is approved for the treatment of breast, non-small-cell lung, prostate, gastric, and head and neck cancers. The drug is given in 3-weekly schedules by a 1-hour infusion of 75 to 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Our research group is working on the development of an oral docetaxel regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010397051">2</xref></sup> An orally available drug could be beneficial in terms of patient convenience, costs, and safety. Furthermore, improved anticancer activity may be obtained by applying more dose-dense docetaxel schedules that warrant an oral drug formulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010397051">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010397051">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The development of an oral docetaxel regimen was started in different mouse models. It has been demonstrated that the oral administration of docetaxel resulted in a very low systemic exposure. This exposure proved, however, to be significantly higher in <italic>Mdr1a/1b</italic> knockout mice <italic>(Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010397051">5</xref></sup> <italic>Mdr1a</italic> and <italic>Mdr1b</italic> encode the 2 murine isoforms of the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). These results were swiftly translated into a proof-of-concept study in humans that investigated orally administered docetaxel in combination with the P-gp and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitor, cyclosporin, an immunosuppressive agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010397051">6</xref></sup> It was demonstrated that the exposure to docetaxel in this combination reached therapeutic levels. Antitumor activity was subsequently demonstrated in a phase 2 trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer (H.H. Helgason, unpublished data, January 2011). Meanwhile, the aforementioned studies in mice continued, and investigators examined the role of the CYP3A enzyme in the disposition of docetaxel. CYP3A is the primary metabolizing enzyme of docetaxel and is abundantly present in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. The effect of CYP3A was investigated by coadministration of docetaxel with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, ritonavir. It was found that the inhibition of CYP3A in mice resulted in a very strong increase in exposure to docetaxel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010397051">5</xref></sup> The exposure to docetaxel was higher than that seen in <italic>Mdr1a/1b</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. These observations resulted in the initiation of a second proof-of-concept study to investigate the oral administration of docetaxel in combination with ritonavir in cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010397051">7</xref></sup> Ritonavir is an HIV-protease inhibitor that is predominantly used in relatively low doses to enhance the exposure to other protease inhibitors by inhibition of CYP3A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010397051">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study with oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir in patients demonstrated the feasibility of this concept. The exposure to docetaxel was effectively boosted by a reduced presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver and a reduced elimination rate of docetaxel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010397051">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010397051">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pharmacology of boosting oral docetaxel by inactivation of P-gp and/or CYP3A was recently further characterized in novel mouse models: mice that lack CYP3A (<italic>Cyp3a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) and mice that lack both P-gp and CYP3A (<italic>Cyp3a/Mdr1a/1b</italic><sup>-/-</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397051">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010397051">11</xref></sup> These studies demonstrated that CYP3A and P-gp work together in lowering docetaxel exposure.</p>
<p>This wealth of both preclinical and clinical pharmacologic data allowed us to investigate whether preclinical results can be translated to humans.</p>
<p>The aim of this study, therefore, was to predict the exposure to docetaxel in humans after oral administration based on preclinical studies in several (knockout) mouse models using population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulations. It was hypothesized that combining the complicated pharmacology of oral and intravenous (IV) docetaxel as unraveled in mice together with data of IV docetaxel administered to cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010397051">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010397051">15</xref></sup> would generate accurate predictions of oral docetaxel in humans, thus enabling rational extrapolation of preclinical data to the human situation.</p>

<p>The study design is schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010397051">Figure 1</xref>. The first step was to develop a population PK model of docetaxel after oral and IV administration in mice using data from 2 mouse model studies (studies A and B).

<title>Preclinical Model Development</title>
<p>The preclinical population PK model was developed using data from 2 preclinical studies, studies A and B. The designs of these studies are briefly described below.</p>

<title>Study A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010397051">5</xref></sup></title>
<p>The experiments in study A were performed using female FVB wild-type and <italic>Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. The mice received docetaxel (10 mg/kg) orally 30 minutes after ritonavir (12.5 mg/kg orally) or vehicle solution (ethanol/cremophor-EL/propyleneglycol/water, 43:10:25:22 [vol/vol/vol/vol] orally). Mice were between 10 and 17 weeks old. In total 4 groups of mice were studied: 2 groups were determined by the 2 genotypes of the mice, and these groups received docetaxel with or without ritonavir. Each group consisted of 4 to 7 mice. Multiple blood samples were collected 5, 10, 20, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after administration of docetaxel, by cannulating the jugular vein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010397051">16</xref></sup> Docetaxel was measured with a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010397051">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397051">10</xref></sup></title>
<p>Experiments in study B were done using wild-type, <italic>Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, and <italic>Cyp3a/Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> double-knockout mice. All mice used in this study were male FVB mice and were between 8 and 14 weeks of age. Each mouse received docetaxel on a single occasion. In total 8 groups of mice were studied: 4 groups were determined by 4 different genotypes of the mice, and these groups received docetaxel either orally or intravenously. Each group consisted of 6 to 8 mice. Docetaxel 10 mg/kg was administered by oral gavage or by injection into the tail vein. Multiple blood samples (~40 µL) were collected from the tail vein at 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after administration of docetaxel. The samples were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography– tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270010397051">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0091270010397051">
<title>Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis</title>
<p>Population PK modeling was performed using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling program NONMEM, version VI (Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Maryland).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270010397051">19</xref></sup> The first-order conditional estimation procedure was used throughout. The adequacy of the tested models was evaluated using both graphical and statistical methods. The log-likelihood ratio test was used to discriminate between hierarchical models differing in only 1 parameter. A difference in objective function value (OFV) of 6.63, corresponding to a <italic>p</italic> value of .01, was considered significant.</p>
<p>Standard errors for all parameters were calculated with the COVARIANCE option in NONMEM, and individual Bayesian PK parameters were obtained using the POSTHOC option. The R-based model building aid Xpose (version 4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010397051">20</xref></sup> and Perl speaks NONMEM (PsN) were used for graphical model evaluation. Piraña was used for run deployment and analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010397051">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Between-subject variability was modeled exponentially and residual variability was modeled using a proportional error model. Because the samples in studies A and B were measured using different techniques (liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and LC-MS/MS, respectively), separate residual error models were investigated for study A and study B.</p>
<p>Body weight was scaled to 70 kg to provide interpretable PK parameters (ie, PK parameters for a 70-kg adult). Scaling was performed using allometry with a power coefficient of 0.75 for clearance and 1 for volume of distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010397051">22</xref></sup> The weight of each mouse was set at 25 g.

<p>In these formulas <italic>CL<sub>wt</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>wt</sub></italic> denote the scaled parameter estimate of a wild-type mouse for clearance and bioavailability, respectively; F<sub>gut</sub> is the fraction docetaxel absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract; F<sub>hep</sub> is the fraction docetaxel that passes the liver; θ is the estimated fixed effect when the specified gene is knocked out. The specified gene in the formulas is either 1, in case of a knockout mouse, or 0 for a wild-type mouse. The same accounts for <italic>RTV</italic>. When docetaxel is given in combination with ritonavir, this factor is 1; otherwise it is 0. The factors θ<sup>Cyp3a/Mdr1a/1b-/-</sup> and θ<sup>RTV/Mdr1a/1b-/-</sup> are interaction factors.

<title>Extrapolation and Simulation to Humans</title>
<p>The developed preclinical PK model was subsequently extended with a well-established model for IV docetaxel in human. The bioavailability and the relative effects of the different detoxifying systems (P-gp and CYP3A4) as identified in mice were incorporated into the model of IV docetaxel in cancer patients. The absorption rate constant (<italic>Ka</italic>) was not scaled because body weight is not a major determinant. Therefore, it was assumed that 50% would be absorbed within the first hour after intake; consequently, <italic>Ka</italic> of oral docetaxel in humans was set at 0.7 h<sup>−1</sup>. The hepatic blood flow was set at 80 L/h, and the ritonavir plasma concentrations were estimated using a previously described population PK model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270010397051">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>This combined model was used to predict exposure to orally administered docetaxel in humans, toward which aim 2 hypothetical situations were simulated: oral docetaxel 100 mg in humans assuming complete CYP3A inhibition (Sim A) or in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir given 1 hour prior to docetaxel (Sim B).</p>
<p>With this model, 1000 individuals were simulated for the 2 aforementioned situations. The simulated results were presented by an adapted visual predictive check. The median and the 50% confidence area of the simulated data were plotted. The model-predicted human exposure was compared with actual human exposure. The median observed concentration–time curve in cancer patients of oral docetaxel in combination with 100 mg ritonavir, given 1 hour prior to docetaxel, was plotted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010397051">7</xref></sup> Patients with histological or cytological proof of cancer, for whom no standard of proven therapeutics exists, were included in this study. Data were available from 15 patients. Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 36, and 48 hours after docetaxel ingestion. The median concentration time curve of oral docetaxel 100 mg when coadministered with ritonavir 100 mg was calculated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mean and coefficient of variation of the area under curve (AUC) of the simulated regimens were calculated. The AUC with extrapolation to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) was determined with R 2.10.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091270010397051">28</xref></sup> by using validated scripts.

<title>PK Model Development in Mice</title>
<p>It was observed that coadministration of the CYP3A inhibitor ritonavir in wild-type mice resulted in a much higher exposure to docetaxel compared with that in <italic>Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, with an estimated gut bioavailability (the fraction of docetaxel that passes the gastrointestinal barrier) of 70% (percentage coefficient of variance [CV%] 30%) and 34% (CV% 23%), respectively. The systemic exposure to docetaxel was also much higher in the <italic>Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice that received ritonavir compared with the exposure in <italic>Cyp3a/Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (gut bioavailability of 105% vs 52 %). A higher than 100% bioavailability was estimated probably because no data were available for intravenously administered docetaxel in combination with ritonavir. The effect of ritonavir on docetaxel clearance was best described applying <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0091270010397051">Equations 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0091270010397051">3</xref>, with an estimated <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> of 0.47 µg/mL (CV% 60%). No nonlinear PK behavior in clearance was observed in the different mouse strains.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270010397051">Table II</xref> the final parameter estimates are presented. Separate estimation of volume of distribution (<italic>V</italic>), intercompartmental clearance (<italic>Q</italic>1), or absorption rate constant (<italic>Ka</italic>) for each mouse strain did improve the model. The final model described the observed data well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010397051">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0091270010397051">3</xref>). The final parameter estimates were estimated with adequate precision; the CV% was low and the results of the visual predictive check demonstrated that the confidence interval and the median of the simulated data were in accordance with the observed data in mice.

<title>Interaction Between CYP3A, P-gp and Coadministered Ritonavir</title>
<p>The <italic>Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice demonstrated an 86% reduction in intrinsic clearance (from 72.9 L/h to 10.4 L/h) and the <italic>Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice demonstrated a 24% reduction in intrinsic clearance (from 72.9 L/h to 55.0 L/h). These data indicate that Cyp3a and P-gp are the most important factors responsible for docetaxel metabolism. The intrinsic clearance in the absence of both CYP3A and P-gp (<italic>Cyp3a/Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice) was low and accounted for approximately 2% of total docetaxel intrinsic clearance in the presence of these proteins (1.6 L/h vs 72.9 L/h). Based on these clearance estimates, an interaction between CYP3A and P-gp could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Besides the intrinsic clearance, the interaction between CYP3A and P-gp was also studied at the level of gut bioavailability. Mice lacking CYP3A and/or P-gp showed a higher gut bioavailability compared with wild-type mice. Mice lacking CYP3A showed a 7% (34% vs 27%) increase in gut bioavailability and mice lacking P-gp showed a 13% increase (40% vs 27%). The combined loss of both enzymes showed a more than additive increase of 25% in gut bioavailability (52% vs 27%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have developed a PK model of orally and intravenously administered docetaxel in mice. The results of 2 preclinical studies could be integrated successfully as demonstrated in the visual predictive checks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0091270010397051">Figure 3</xref>). Corrections for different study design, handling of samples, and analytical assays were not required, except for a small difference in residual error, which was slightly higher for study A (32%) compared with study B (26%). The developed model adequately described the PK in different mouse strains. Based on the PK alone, similar conclusions could be drawn compared with the original studies that were analyzed using noncompartmental analysis. For example, coadministered ritonavir resulted in high exposure to docetaxel, and CYP3A is quantitatively the most import factor to influence the low systemic exposure to docetaxel when given orally. The original study of van Waterschoot et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397051">10</xref></sup> was designed to unravel the interplay between CYP3A and P-gp. A functional interplay, as has been proposed by Benet and Cummins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091270010397051">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091270010397051">30</xref></sup> suggests that P-pg works as a gatekeeper to prevent saturation of intracellular CYP3A. In this manner, P-gp would increase the amount of drug metabolized by CYP3A. This has been described as a synergistic relationship. However, neither the conducted experiments conducted by van Waterschoot et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397051">10</xref></sup> nor the population PK analysis of the data described here could confirm this hypothesis. The separate effects of CYP3A and P-gp seemed to account for the total intrinsic clearance observed in wild-type mice: <italic>Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had a reduction of 17.9 L/h in clearance compared with wild-type mice (72.9 L/h vs 55.0 L/h), and Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a 62.5 L/h lower clearance compared with wild-type mice (72.9 L/h vs 10.4 L/h). Mice with total loss of both proteins showed only a small intrinsic clearance of 1.6 L/h, which is probably a result of minor alternative elimination routes, some of which may have been upregulated because of the combined loss of CYP3A and P-gp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397051">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The gut bioavailability (the percentage of docetaxel that actually passes the intestinal barrier) is 1.3- to 1.5-fold higher in the single knockout mice (<italic>Mdr1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, 40%; <italic>Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, 34%) and 2-fold higher in the double knockout mice (52%) compared with wild-type mice (27%).</p>
<p>These percentages may indicate that CYP3A and P-gp work together synergistically, because the bioavailability increases more than additively in mice with combined loss of CYP3A and P-gp. However, as extensively discussed by van Waterschoot et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397051">10</xref></sup> the mechanistic interaction between CYP3A and P-gp should be investigated from the perspective of a double knockout mouse. From this perspective it is observed that the individual contribution of CYP3A or P-gp in preventing docetaxel from passing the gut barrier is larger in the absence of the other protein. Thus, when one of these proteins is not functioning, then the other protein exerts its effect more efficiently. Garmire et al observed a similar effect in their in silico model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091270010397051">31</xref></sup> and described this effect as CYP3A–P-gp antagonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091270010397051">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exposure to docetaxel was much higher in wild-type mice that received coadministered ritonavir (<italic>F<sub>gut</sub></italic>, 70%) than the exposure in <italic>Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse (<italic>F<sub>gut</sub></italic>, 34%). This large discrepancy may be explained by inhibition of P-gp by ritonavir, although in vitro experiments failed to demonstrate that ritonavir was unable to inhibit the transport of docetaxel through LLC-MDR1 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010397051">1</xref></sup> Another explanation could be upregulation of detoxifying enzymes (transporters or other metabolizing enzymes) in <italic>Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397051">10</xref></sup> Indeed, some upregulation of <italic>Mdr1a</italic> has been observed in the liver of Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup> mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091270010397051">33</xref></sup> The clearance of docetaxel when coadministered with ritonavir was described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0091270010397051">Equations 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0091270010397051">3</xref>, showing a ritonavir concentration–dependent clearance of docetaxel, with an inhibition constant of 0.47 µg/mL in mice. Using this inhibition constant for the prediction of oral docetaxel exposure in humans resulted in underprediction of the docetaxel concentration time curve as determined in a clinical trial (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270010397051">Figure 4B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010397051">7</xref></sup> Population PK analysis of oral docetaxel in humans demonstrated a much lower inhibition constant of 0.028 µg/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010397051">9</xref></sup> This is probably caused by overpredicted ritonavir plasma concentrations in mice when scaled allometrically. Plasma concentration–time data of ritonavir in mice would probably have generated more accurate estimations of docetaxel exposure in humans. However, these data were not available.</p>
<p>Extrapolation of PK results between species has been reviewed often. In most cases, results of multiple species of different sizes are used to extrapolate to humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091270010397051">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010397051">22</xref></sup> Studies that extrapolated PK data to humans using only data of mice are rare. This is not surprising regarding the large physiological differences between mice and humans. In our case, however, we coupled preclinical data on orally administered docetaxel with clinical data on intravenously administered docetaxel. This strategy resulted in predictions that were in good agreement with the observed data on orally administered docetaxel in combination with ritonavir to patients.</p>
<p>Studies are being designed to investigate more thoroughly the formation and PK of docetaxel and ritonavir metabolites after inhibition of, or the absence of, drug transporters and/or metabolizing enzymes in preclinical mice and in vitro studies. The current analysis provides an excellent tool to incorporate the generated data into a single (physiological) model and to extrapolate these data to humans and to preliminarily judge the validity of these extrapolated data.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a population PK model of preclinical data was successfully developed. The model provided a good pharmacological insight into boosted, orally administered docetaxel and the influence and interaction of P-gp and CYP3A. Furthermore, the developed model provided a tool to extrapolate the results of future preclinical studies to humans, and finally, this study demonstrates that the use of population PK analysis in an early, preclinical stage can help in accurately estimating PK in humans and thereby help optimize boosted docetaxel regimens for patients.</p>

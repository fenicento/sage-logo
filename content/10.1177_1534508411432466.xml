<abstract>
<p>Treatment integrity data are essential to drawing valid conclusions in treatment outcome studies. Such data, however, are not always included in peer-reviewed research articles in school psychology or related fields. To gain a better understanding of why treatment integrity data are lacking in the school psychology research, we surveyed the authors of the 210 treatment outcome articles published in four school psychology journals from 1995 through 2008 regarding their perceptions of barriers to implementing treatment integrity procedures. Results indicated that (a) lack of theory and specific guidelines on treatment integrity procedures; (b) lack of general knowledge about treatment integrity; (c) time, cost, and labor demands; and (d) lack of editorial requirement were broadly perceived as barriers by school psychology researchers to implementing treatment integrity procedures. Implications for future research are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Treatment integrity is generally defined as the extent to which an intervention is implemented as planned (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411432466">Gresham, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534508411432466">Yeaton &amp; Sechrest, 1981</xref>). Although recent conceptual models of treatment integrity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411432466">Power et al., 2005</xref>) dissect this construct into multiple dimensions (e.g., adherence, exposure, participant responsiveness, and others), the focus remains on the quantity (i.e., what percentage of the component intervention steps were implemented) and quality (i.e., how well component intervention steps were implemented) of intervention implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411432466">Sanetti &amp; Kratochwill, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of studies have documented a positive correlation between treatment integrity and student outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411432466">DiGennaro, Martens, &amp; Kleinmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411432466">DiGennaro, Martens, &amp; McIntyre, 2005</xref>). More recently, researchers have conducted parametric analyses wherein treatment integrity levels are experimentally manipulated to examine the impact on client outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534508411432466">St. Peter Pipkin, Vollmer, and Sloman (2010)</xref> showed that certain types of integrity errors (i.e., reinforcement of problem behavior [commission error]) are more detrimental than other types of errors (i.e., not implementing intervention components [omission error]). The findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411432466">DiGennaro Reed, Reed, Baez, and Maguire (2011)</xref> revealed that treatment integrity commission errors produced low levels of acquisition during instruction in young children with disabilities. Relatedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411432466">Noell, Gresham, and Gansle (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411432466">Hirschstein and colleagues (2007)</xref> showed that decrements in treatment integrity (i.e., omission errors) negatively affected student performance on computerized mathematics tasks and social skills, respectively. These and other studies comprise a growing body of experimental literature supporting the notion that treatment integrity is worthy of measurement during academic, behavioral, and social-emotional intervention in applied settings. However, despite these findings, treatment integrity may be infrequently measured in applied settings. For example, in a survey of individuals with the Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP) credential, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411432466">Cochrane and Laux (2008)</xref> documented that few respondents measure treatment integrity and that, when they do measure it, they rely on indirect methods (e.g., teacher interview or self-report). These findings were observed despite nearly all of the respondents indicating agreement that treatment integrity measurement is important within a Response-to-Intervention (RTI) model and in evaluating success of an intervention. The latter findings are alarming given that student eligibility determinations and intervention decisions rest on the premise that the intervention was delivered as intended (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411432466">Noell &amp; Gansle, 2006</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411432466">Sanetti &amp; Kratochwill, 2009</xref>, for more detailed discussions).</p>
<p>Treatment integrity and student outcome data are not only important in school and clinical settings but they are also essential to drawing valid conclusions in treatment outcome research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534508411432466">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>). The goal of experimental research designs is to isolate and measure the effects of independent variables on dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411432466">Gresham, 1997</xref>). Failure to ensure accurate implementation of the independent variable (i.e., treatment integrity) influences experimental validity and thus poses threats to any inferences made in treatment outcome research. Treatment integrity influences all four types of experimental validity that allow researchers to draw conclusions from experiments: internal validity, external validity, construct validity, and statistical conclusion validity. <italic>Internal validity</italic> refers to conclusions about the degree to which changes in the dependent variable can be ascribed to the manipulations of the independent variable. When there is significant student behavior change and treatment integrity is not assessed, then the validity of inferences regarding this causal relation may be compromised. Likewise, if there is no behavior change and treatment integrity is not monitored, it becomes difficult to differentiate between an ineffective treatment and an effective treatment implemented with low levels of treatment integrity. Without question, assessing and ensuring high levels of treatment integrity is essential to drawing valid conclusions in the social and behavioral sciences. <italic>External validity</italic> refers to conclusions about the extent to which the causal relation between the independent and dependent variables generalizes to conditions beyond those of the experiment. Such inferences are influenced by treatment integrity as poorly defined, described, or implemented interventions make the replication, evaluation, and generalization of treatments difficult, if not impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411432466">Moncher &amp; Prinz, 1991</xref>). <italic>Construct validity</italic> refers to conclusions about the higher order constructs represented by the persons, treatments, outcomes, and settings studied and is essential to ruling out any potential confounds that could compromise interpretation of study results. Monitoring treatment integrity throughout intervention implementation may provide the data needed to either rule out or identify such confounds. <italic>Statistical conclusion validity</italic> refers to conclusions about whether the treatment and outcome covary and the strength of the covariation that result from the quantitative evaluation of a study. For example, a researcher comparing two treatments would like to conclude that any differences between treatment conditions are due to true differences between the groups. Yet the standard deviation, a measure of variability, is taken into account in the denominator of the equation when calculating an effect size. There are various potential sources of variability, including differences in treatment integrity. Thus, inconsistency in treatment integrity can increase measures of variability which can then result in lower effect sizes, creating a threat to statistical conclusion validity. Without question, assessing and ensuring high levels of treatment integrity is essential to drawing valid conclusions in the social and behavioral sciences.</p>
<p>Although necessary for drawing valid conclusions from research, treatment integrity data are not always included in peer-reviewed research articles in school psychology or related fields (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508411432466">Sanetti &amp; Kratochwill, 2008</xref>, for a review). Results of a review of school-based behavioral interventions published between 1980 and 1990 indicated that only 14.4% of included studies reported quantitative treatment integrity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411432466">Gresham, Gansle, Noell, &amp; Cohen, 1993</xref>). Other reviews have documented similar findings of school-based treatment studies in the <italic>Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411432466">Gresham, Gansle, &amp; Noell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411432466">McIntyre, Gresham, DiGennaro, &amp; Reed, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411432466">Peterson, Homer, &amp; Wonderlich, 1982</xref>). Results of a more recent review of treatment outcome studies published in four school psychology journals (<italic>School Psychology Review, School Psychology Quarterly, Journal of School Psychology, Psychology in the Schools</italic>) between 1995 and 2008 indicated that 50.2% of included studies reported quantitative treatment integrity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411432466">Sanetti, Gritter, &amp; Dobey, 2011</xref>). The increase in the prevalence of treatment integrity data is encouraging. However, there is significant room for improvement as nearly half of the treatment outcomes studies in the field of school psychology do not include such data.</p>
<p>An examination of the potential barriers to implementing treatment integrity assessment procedures in treatment outcome research may provide a better understanding of why treatment integrity data continue to be lacking in the school psychology literature base. Such an examination was conducted in the clinical psychology literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova, Hilt, Chereji, and Kazdin (2009)</xref>. The purpose of the current study is to conduct a survey informed by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova et al. (2009)</xref> and evaluate school psychology treatment outcome researchers’ perceived barriers to implementing treatment integrity procedures. Recognition of these barriers may guide future research endeavors or help to identify practical solutions to measuring and reporting treatment integrity data in experimental research studies.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study were authors of the 210 treatment outcome articles published in <italic>School Psychology Review</italic> (SPR), <italic>School Psychology Quarterly</italic> (SPQ), <italic>Journal of School Psychology</italic> (JSP), or <italic>Psychology in the Schools</italic> (PITS) from 1995 through 2008. Articles were located through a serial search of the table of contents of PITS, JSP, SPQ, and SPR as part of a larger study evaluating the quantity and quality of treatment integrity data in treatment outcome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411432466">Sanetti et al., 2011</xref>). These journals were deemed to be influential to the field because they (a) publish at least four issues per year, (b) target psychology practitioners and researchers, and (c) have higher impact factors than other journals meeting the first two criteria. To be included in the larger study, an article had to (a) have been published between 1995 and 2008, (b) have all participants younger than 19 years of age, (c) employ an experimental or quasi-experimental design, and (d) be longer than three pages. The years 1995 through 2008 were chosen because reviews in related fields (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411432466">McIntyre et al., 2007</xref>) indicated an increasing trend in reporting treatment integrity data after 1995. For additional details about the literature search and study selection procedures, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411432466">Sanetti et al. (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>For the 210 included treatment outcome studies, there were 153 unique first authors (i.e., several individuals authored more than one treatment outcome study during the 13 years reviewed). Of these 153 first authors, valid email addresses were not available for 46 (30.1%). When a valid email address was not available for the first author, we contacted the second author, if the author was not already a participant because of being a first author of an included study. Twenty-eight second authors were contacted; two email addresses were not valid. In all, we contacted 133 unique authors (first authors, <italic>n</italic> = 107, 80.5%; second authors, <italic>n</italic> = 26, 19.5%) via email and asked them to participate in an online survey on a secure website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surveymonkey.com">surveymonkey.com</ext-link>). Authors received three email prompts to complete the survey over 3 months. Of the 133 contacted authors, 44 (33.1%) responded to the survey. The 39 (29.3%) authors who completed the entire anonymous survey constitute the final sample. Respondents averaged 48.47 years of age (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.29, range = 31–66), and 52.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were male. A majority of participants indicated that research (<italic>n</italic> = 33) and teaching (<italic>n</italic> = 27) were their primary and secondary professional activities, respectively. Participants (97.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 37) worked in a university or college setting and reported a mean of 17.39 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.25, range 6–38 years) in the treatment outcome research field. When asked to indicate a theoretical orientation, 87.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 34) endorsed skill-building approaches (e.g., cognitive-behavioral) and the remaining endorsed non-skill-building approaches (e.g., psychoanalytic, eclectic).</p>

<title>Measure</title>
<p>The <italic>Barriers to Treatment Integrity Implementation Survey</italic> (BTIIS) was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova and colleagues (2009)</xref> to “assess possible impediments to addressing treatment integrity of psychosocial interventions” (p. 213). The BTIIS has 30 questions rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale (<italic>always disagree, mostly disagree, sometimes disagree, sometimes agree, mostly agree</italic>, and <italic>always agree</italic>). Total scores range from 30 to 180, with higher scores being indicative of more perceived barriers. The BTIIS items cover five domains of potential barriers to addressing treatment integrity: (a) lack of appreciation of treatment integrity (four items); (b) lack of general knowledge about treatment integrity (eight items); (c) lack of theory and specific guidelines on treatment integrity procedures (seven items); (d) the time, cost, and labor demands (five items); and (e) lack of editorial requirement (six items) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova et al., 2009</xref>, for more detailed information about the development of the BTIIS). Ten BTIIS items were revised to better align with school-based intervention delivery, resulting in the BTIIS-R. More specifically, for Items 16, 17, 24, 25, and 29, “therapist” was replaced with “interventionist”; for Items 9, 13, and 20, “adherence and competence” was replaced with “treatment integrity”; for Item 2, “procedural fidelity” was added as a term used to refer to treatment integrity; and for Item 11, “treatment manuals” was replaced with “critical components of treatments.” In our experience, this terminology is more consistent with the language used in the published school psychology literature and school-based practice. In addition, we modified the scale from 6 to 5 points with a neutral central position (i.e., <italic>always disagree, mostly disagree, sometimes agree, mostly agree</italic>, and <italic>always agree</italic>) given recent findings documenting that researchers prefer a 5-point scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411432466">Gwinner, n.d</xref>.). As a result, total scores for the revised scale could range from 30 to 150; mean item ratings greater than 2.5 represent perceived barriers.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411432466">Table 1</xref> displays the mean rating of each barrier on the BTIIS-R. Total scores for the survey ranged from 56 to 117 (<italic>M</italic> = 81.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.32). The internal consistency reliability estimate using Cronbach’s alpha was .84, which indicates a high level of internal consistency for our scale with this particular sample of respondents. Because we modified the number of points in the survey, we adjusted the cut-point in the present study from that used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova and colleagues (2009)</xref>. Ratings equal to or less than 2.5 indicate that a survey item is perceived as not a barrier; greater than 2.5 and equal to or less than 3.3 indicate that a survey item is perceived as a barrier; and greater than 3.3 indicate that a survey item is perceived as a strong barrier. In the present study, 21 of the 30 survey items (70%) were rated greater than 2.5 (i.e., barriers or strong barriers). There are 9 items (30%) in the not barriers category, 15 items (50%) in the barriers category, and 6 items (20%) in the strong barriers category.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study evaluated perceived barriers to implementing treatment integrity procedures as reported by researchers who publish in the area of school psychology treatment outcomes. Survey respondents identified barriers within all but one domain; respondents did not report lack of appreciation of treatment integrity to be a barrier to measuring treatment integrity. Although the current study documented two fewer overall barriers than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova et al. (2009)</xref>, eight of the nine highest rated items were identical across both studies. Moreover, seven of the nine lowest ranked items were similar across both studies. The same domains were identified as barriers and strong barriers in both studies. In addition, the internal consistency reliability in our study (α = .84) was similar to the estimate reported by Perepletchikova et al. (α = .80). These findings suggest that researchers in both clinical and school psychology identify similar barriers to assessing treatment integrity. The perceived barriers include criteria that specify acceptable levels of treatment integrity and interventionist competence, inconsistent use of terminology, appropriate assessment methods, and the time requirements for designing protocols, training interventionists, and assessing integrity.</p>
<p>Researchers in both fields also perceive that knowledge about treatment integrity is not a barrier to its implementation and generally agree on the importance of this aspect of conducting research. The differences in the perceived barriers across the two studies were few. School psychology researchers endorsed Items 18 (i.e., there is a considerable time requirement in obtaining accurate representation of treatment integrity data) and 11 (i.e., the critical components of treatments have not been sufficiently identified to permit adequate treatment integrity implementation) as a strong barrier and a barrier, respectively, whereas clinical psychology researchers did not perceive these to be barriers. Clinical psychology researchers endorsed Items 4, 20, and 19 as barriers, but these items were not perceived as barriers by school psychology researchers. An interesting pattern was that some of the findings from the current study are consistent with those from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411432466">Cochrane and Laux (2008)</xref>. Specifically, school psychology practitioners also perceived time requirements and training interventionists as significant barriers to treatment integrity assessment as well as treatment integrity as highly important to intervention evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411432466">Cochrane &amp; Laux, 2008</xref>). Overall, findings across these studies reflect growing consensus regarding both the importance of treatment integrity in intervention evaluation and the barriers to treatment integrity assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411432466">Sanetti &amp; Kratochwill, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We were not surprised that a lack of theory and guidelines was perceived to be a strong barrier or that lack of general knowledge about treatment integrity was perceived to be a barrier to treatment integrity implementation. Treatment integrity involves much more than assessing adherence to an intervention protocol; however, school psychology researchers and practitioners commonly measure only this aspect of integrity if they measure treatment integrity at all (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411432466">Sanetti et al., 2011</xref>, for a review). Treatment integrity has been described as a multidimensional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411432466">Dane &amp; Schneider, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411432466">Jones, Clarke, &amp; Power, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411432466">Noell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411432466">O’Donnell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411432466">Power et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534508411432466">Sanetti &amp; Kratochwill, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411432466">Waltz, Addis, Koerner, &amp; Jacobson, 1993</xref>) with numerous conceptual models that identify the varied dimensions. Those outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411432466">Dane and Schneider (1998)</xref> include adherence, competence, exposure, quality, responsiveness, and program differentiation. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534508411432466">Waltz and colleagues (1993)</xref> differentiate between unique and essential behaviors, essential but not unique behaviors, acceptable but not necessary behaviors, and others. In behavioral medicine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411432466">Resnick et al. (2005)</xref> summarize components of treatment fidelity evaluated in the studies included in their review including design (study features that allow adequate hypothesis testing), training (formative evaluation of interventionists), delivery (ensuring treatment is delivered as planned), receipt (ensuring participant is able to perform skills/strategies required by treatment), and enactment (skills/strategies received by participant are performed outside of the treatment setting). Although there is overlap among these and other models, research has not supported a particular model over another, nor has it arrived at a comprehensive definition of treatment integrity. This directly affects the development of appropriate measurement procedures and how best to assess treatment integrity, which were also raised as barriers in this study. To complicate matters further, varied language is used interchangeably with the term “treatment integrity” (e.g., “treatment implementation integrity,” “intervention integrity,” “treatment fidelity,” and “procedural reliability”). To address these barriers, the aforementioned conceptual models must be evaluated scientifically so that the varied dimensions acquire empirical support across studies and researchers. A logical extension of this important work is the development of an empirically supported, comprehensive definition of treatment integrity that incorporates the relevant dimensions.</p>
<p>Time, cost, and labor demands were reported to be another strong barrier to treatment integrity implementation, which supports the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411432466">Cochrane and Laux (2008)</xref>. Thus, it appears there is continued support for the notion that resource demands affect behavior of researchers and school-based practitioners. Again, we are not surprised by this result considering the emerging state of the science of treatment integrity. Many of the barriers that increase the resource demands of treatment integrity implementation will be decreased as the science of treatment integrity evolves. For example, the lack of consensus about (a) how to measure treatment integrity, (b) the aspects of treatment integrity need to be assessed, (c) the frequency of assessment needed to obtain representative data, and (d) how to efficiently train interventionists were identified as strong barriers and can all be addressed empirically as research in this area grows. Funding agencies (e.g., Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education) have begun to recognize the need to support treatment integrity research, as evidenced by requirements to develop treatment integrity measures for intervention efficacy trials and analyze outcome data in relation to treatment integrity. Such grant requirements could, for example, simultaneously (a) allow researchers to allocate time, personnel, and financial resources to the development of psychometrically sound treatment integrity measures; (b) provide practitioners with measure to use in practice; (c) build the literature base related to treatment integrity assessment practices; and (d) inform training practices.</p>
<p>To build a literature base around treatment integrity, it is essential that treatment integrity information is published in peer-reviewed journals. However, lack of editorial requirements for inclusion of such information was perceived to be a barrier to implementing treatment integrity procedures. This finding is similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova et al. (2009)</xref> and provides further evidence of the “curious double standard” described in previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411432466">McIntyre et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411432466">Peterson et al., 1982</xref>) wherein measurement of the independent variables (i.e., reliability of the intervention procedures) is not required for publication in the same way it is for dependent variables. More recent research has documented infrequent independent variable reliability across school psychology journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411432466">Sanetti et al., 2011</xref>). Without question, to build a knowledge base related to treatment integrity, and thereby potentially decrease some barriers to treatment integrity implementation, it is essential that journal editors and reviewers not only require authors to provide quantitative treatment integrity data but also require a description of treatment integrity assessment procedures equal to that of the dependent variable measures.</p>
<p>Several limitations exist and should be addressed in future research. First, our sample of respondents represented only 29% of the individuals who were asked to complete the survey. Although this response percentage is similar to those obtained in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411432466">Costenbader, Swartz, &amp; Petrix, 1992</xref>), we had hoped to sample a larger percentage of researchers examining treatment outcomes. The perceived barriers rated by the current survey respondents may not represent the perceptions of the larger sample. Respondents completed the survey anonymously and, as a result, we are unable to statistically evaluate relations between demographic variables, study features, and perceived barriers. The extent to which respondents’ experiences with academic or behavioral interventions differ and how these experiences interact with their survey ratings is unknown. In addition, the focus of our study was to examine perceived barriers without examining actual treatment integrity implementation practices. Previous research has documented a significant relation between these two variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova et al., 2009</xref>) such that poorer procedural implementation was associated with higher numbers of perceived barriers. The extent to which this relationship exists in our current sample is unknown and is a valuable area for future research. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that client gains are highest when interventions are implemented with integrity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411432466">DiGennaro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411432466">DiGennaro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411432466">Noell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534508411432466">Wilder, Atwell, &amp; Wine, 2006</xref>). The relation between perceived barriers, actual barriers, and client outcomes has not been formally evaluated. It makes conceptual sense that a relation exists, but this has not yet been documented empirically. Last, the psychometric properties of the survey are limited; future research might calculate test–retest reliability and establish validity of the scale. The current study only assessed respondents’ perceptions on one occasion; other sources for assessing barriers to treatment integrity measurement were not used to validate the current scale. Although internal consistency reliability was relatively high across our study and the study published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411432466">Perepletchikova and colleagues (2009)</xref>, the items are conceptually derived, not empirically derived. Future research might directly measure and quantify the barrier domains of the scale (e.g., editorial requirements; time, cost, and labor demands; and others), rather than rely on perceptions alone.</p>
<p>In sum, the present study evaluated perceived barriers to implementing treatment integrity procedures. Results indicated that (a) lack of theory and specific guidelines on treatment integrity procedures; (b) lack of general knowledge about treatment integrity; (c) time, cost, and labor demands; and (d) lack of editorial requirement were broadly perceived as barriers to implementing treatment integrity procedures by school psychology researchers. Future research could address perceived and actual barriers as well as experimentally validating a conceptual model of treatment integrity. The impact on both research and practice could be substantial.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Harlequin syndrome, Harlequin sign, Holmes-Adie syndrome, and Ross syndrome lie on a spectrum of partial dysautonomias affecting facial sudomotor, vasomotor, and pupillary responses. These syndromes have imprecise clinical boundaries and overlap syndromes are known. We report a 9-year-old girl who presented with anhidrosis over the right half of her face and the left side of her body, with compensatory hyperhidrosis on the contralateral side. She was noted to have bilateral tonic pupils and normal muscle stretch reflexes with other features suggestive of autonomic dysfunction. Investigations to rule out secondary causes were noncontributory. Her clinical presentation can be categorized as partial overlap between Harlequin syndrome and Holmes-Adie syndrome.</p>

<body>
<p>Harlequin syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of unilateral flushing and sweating of face or face and arm, strictly with normal ocular sympathetic innervation, as described by Lance et al in 1988.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812446484">1</xref></sup> It has been increasingly realized that this falls on a spectrum of partial dysautonomias affecting sudomotor, pupillary, and vasomotor responses in the facial or facio-brachial region. These include Harlequin syndrome, Harlequin sign, Holmes-Adie syndrome, and Ross syndrome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812446484">Table 1</xref>). The distinction between these clinical entities is blurred, and there is considerable overlap. They may represent more widespread autonomic dysfunction than previously believed. We describe a 9-year-old girl who can be classified as having partial overlap of Harlequin and Holmes-Adie syndromes.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 9-year-old girl was apparently well about 3 years back when she insidiously developed decreased sweating associated with sensation of warmth or increased temperature over left foot. This progressively increased in severity and extent to involve contiguous proximal areas. At the time of presentation, the area of decreased to absent sweating involved the left lower limb, left upper limb, left side of the trunk, and right side of face and neck. There was normal to increased sweating on contralateral sides with sharp demarcation.</p>
<p>Besides these complaints, she also experienced intermittent noncolicky periumbilical pain lasting for 1 to 2 hours for the past 1 year. Since the past 6 months, she had also developed episodic nonthrobbing headaches in bilateral temporal regions, 1 to 2 times a week, sometimes associated with nausea with no photophobia or phonophobia. There was history suggestive of migraine in her mother.</p>
<p>There was no history of paresthesias, burning pain, loss of sensations, self-mutilation, repeated fractures, any motor weakness, seizures, cognitive decline, and decreased hearing or vision. She is a student of class VI, and there were no concerns about her school performance or behavior.</p>
<p>On examination, there was reticulate pigmentation over her left thigh and inguinal region, which considerably darkened on exposure to sun. There were no orange or yellow tonsils. Her blood pressure was normal, and there was no evidence of orthostatic hypotension. The extent of anhidrosis was as described in her history. Her higher mental functions and speech were normal. Both pupils had irregular shape and were dilated with no light reflex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812446484">Figure 1B</xref>). There was no ptosis. The muscle stretch reflexes were normal. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.</p>

</fig>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and whole spine were normal. The carotid Doppler ultrasound was unremarkable. Her thyroid and lipid profiles, random blood sugar, and serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were normal. Repeated urine samples for porphyrobilinogen were negative. The enzyme for Fabry disease was also normal. Routine nerve conduction studies were normal. The sympathetic skin responses in both upper and lower limbs were absent.</p>
<p>The starch iodine test documented anhidrosis over the left half of the body and the right half of the face and neck with compensatory hyperhidrosis on contralateral sides. After exercise-induced sweating, there was nearly complete anhidrosis on the right side of the face with compensatory hyperhidrosis on the opposite side with sharp demarcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812446484">Figure 1A</xref>). Gustatory sweating and flushing, induced by tasting a teaspoon of hot chili sauce, which was held in the mouth for 1 min, was present over the right half of the face. The analysis of the heart rate variability was unremarkable. Administration of 0.125% pilocarpine eye drops locally produced miosis in both the eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812446484">Figure 1C</xref>). On a separate visit, administration of 1% phenylephrine did not produce further pupillary dilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812446484">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>A diagnosis of Harlequin syndrome with bilateral tonic pupils with ocular parasympathetic denervation supersensitivity was made. The child and her parents were explained the benign nature of this condition and were advised regular follow-ups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Harlequin is a fictional character of European folklore, a supposed emissary of the devil with a red and black face mask, probably first described in Dante's <italic>Inferno</italic>. Since the initial description of Harlequin syndrome by Lance et al in 1988,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812446484">1</xref></sup> more than 85 cases have been described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446484">3</xref></sup> Classically, it was defined as unilateral facial flushing and sweating with normal ocular sympathetic innervation, but the classification of partial sudomotor dysautonomias is evolving with overlap syndromes being recognized. Majority of the reported cases of Harlequin syndrome are primary in which no underling etiology could be found. It is more commonly seen in females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446484">3</xref></sup> The reported causes underlying the secondary Harlequin syndrome are heterogenous (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812446484">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, most of the reported cases of Harlequin syndrome in children have been secondary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812446484">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812446484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812446484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812446484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812446484"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812446484">9</xref></sup> The syndrome may be a result of generalized injury to peripheral autonomic and dorsal root ganglia, which are all neural crest derivatives.</p>

<p>The sympathetic nervous system control facial sweating. Although it exerts a tonic constrictor influence on the vasculature of the ears, nose, and the lips, it also actively dilates the cutaneous vasculature of the face during heat, stress, or emotion. Emotion-induced sweating is unaffected in central lesions.</p>
<p>The sympathetic fibers innervating the face originate from the hypothalamus (first-order neuron) and synapse in the lateral horn of the spinal cord with the preganglionic (second-order) neurons. The sudomotor and the vasomotor fibers leave the cord at T<sub>2-3</sub> and travel within the sympathetic chain to synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. The postganglionic fibers (third-order neuron) then travel within the carotid plexus to reach their effectors. An ipsilateral sympathetic lesion leads to loss of flushing and anhidrosis on that side of the face with contralateral excessive sweating and flushing. The preganglionic neurons that supply the upper extremity originate distal from T4, and synapse at the stellate ganglion. The sympathetic preganglionic fibers supplying the iris dilator muscle exit mainly at T1 and synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. The postganglionic fibers then ascend with the internal carotid artery and supply the ocular smooth muscles. The pattern of symptoms and the variable involvement of the face, arms, and ocular smooth muscles may help to identify the exact site of the lesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446484">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The parasympathetic system mainly supplies the exocrine glands of the face but after sympathetic fiber injury, parasympathetic reflexes may provoke pathologic sweating. Gustatory-induced sweating is unchanged or even increased following pre- or postganglionic sympathetic lesions due to aberrant cross-reinnervation. The ocular parasympathetic supply originates from the ipsilateral Edinger-Westphal nucleus and supplies the iris sphincter through the ciliary ganglion.</p>
<p>In the index case, the anhidrosis was observed over the right half of the face and left upper limb and left side of the trunk. This pattern of involvement cannot be explained by a single lesion along the sympathetic pathway and may imply a multifocal involvement. Such “crossed” sympathetic deficits have been described previously in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812446484">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812446484"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812446484">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our patient also had bilateral tonic pupils. The tonic pupils observed in Ross and Holmes-Adie syndromes have been attributed to the damage to the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers due to a degenerative process affecting the ciliary ganglion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812446484">13</xref></sup> as corroborated by the demonstration of the denervation supersensitivity of the iris sphincter to 0.125% pilocarpine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812446484">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was no hyporeflexia in this child. Thus, it could not be classified into either Ross or Holmes-Adie syndromes. Moreover, patchy sympathetic denervation, tonic pupils, complaints of abdominal pain and migrainous headaches, photosensitive reticulate pigmentation, and the absent sympathetic skin responses imply a more widespread autonomic dysfunction, likely involving cutaneous and enteric autonomic responses. Kalapesi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812446484">15</xref></sup> described a similar diagnostic dilemma in a 31-year-old woman who presented with Harlequin syndrome with tonic pupils and preserved muscle stretch reflexes. Our child can be described as having Harlequin syndrome with bilateral tonic pupils with ocular parasympathetic denervation sensitivity, thus having an overlap involving Harlequin syndrome and Holmes-Adie syndrome.</p>
<p>Harlequin syndrome is a clinically striking disorder rarely encountered in the pediatric neurology practice. Detailed clinical examination, testing of autonomic functions, and appropriate imaging techniques may help to describe additional abnormalities and localize the site of sympathetic deficit. These disorders are usually benign and do not warrant any specific treatment. Our patient had onset of disease in childhood and showed initial progression of symptoms. No cause could be ascertained despite extensive workup. The symptoms could not be explained by a single lesion and a more widespread autonomic dysfunction was more probable.</p>

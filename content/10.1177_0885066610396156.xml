<abstract>
<p>Received November 10, 2009. Received Revised June 17, 2010. Submitted June 21, 2010. Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are highly morbid conditions that are common and underrecognized in the intensive care unit. Intra-abdominal hypertension affects the critically ill patient population and is not solely limited to the trauma and surgical subgroups. The recognition of IAH and ACS as distinct clinical states has become more apparent. Extensive bench and clinical research has shed significant light into the definition, incidence, etiology, physiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment strategies. Although further research into this morbid condition is needed, improvement in recognition is a critical first step. This review aims to scrutinize the basic science and clinical literature available on this condition in a surgically focused, organ-system-based approach.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The abdominal cavity is a relatively nonexpandable compartment bound superiorly by the diaphragm, inferiorly by the pelvis, and circumferentially by the abdominal wall. The pressure within the abdomen is normally atmospheric (&lt;7 mm Hg) or subatmospheric (ie, negative) in a spontaneously breathing animal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066610396156">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066610396156">2</xref></sup> Intra-abdominal pathology may lead to increased pressure in this relatively rigid compartment. Although descriptions of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) date back to the early 19th century,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066610396156">3</xref></sup> intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) was first described as a clinical entity in 1984 by Kron et al when they described 4 cases of ACS following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066610396156">4</xref></sup> Recently, definitions for IAH and ACS have been proposed in the literature, which have allowed for more uniform study of these processes. This review aims to scrutinize the basic science and clinical literature available on this condition in a surgically focused, organ-system-based approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0885066610396156">
<title>Definition, Incidence, and Etiology</title>
<p>In 2004, in an attempt to resolve this confusion, the World Society of the ACS (WSACS) was convened and an international consensus statement was published. This consensus statement defined IAH as intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 12 mm Hg or more in 3 readings 4 to 6 hours apart, or an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 60 mm Hg or less in a minimum of 2 standardized measurements 1 to 6 hours apart, keeping in mind that an IAP &lt;20 mm Hg is rarely clinically pathologic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610396156">5</xref></sup> Intra-abdominal hypertension was previously graded by Burch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066610396156">6</xref></sup> and characterized by Meldrum et al based on a prospective trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066610396156">7</xref></sup> The WSACS defined ACS as end organ failure (hypotension, renal dysfunction, ventilatory failure, or intestinal ischemia) in the setting of sustained IAP of 20 mm Hg or more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610396156">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885066610396156">Table 1</xref>
). Primary ACS occurs in the setting of abdominal pathology, as a consequence of surgery, intestinal ischemia/edema, or traumatic insult. Secondary ACS is the development of ACS in the absence of primary abdominal pathology, usually due to capillary leak, fluid resuscitation, or sepsis. Recurrent ACS is the one that redevelops after the treatment of either primary or secondary ACS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885066610396156">Table 2</xref>

<p>The reported incidence of IAH and ACS depends on the definition used, the patient population, the methodology used to measure IAP, and the frequency with which it is measured. Intra-abdominal pressure, like other physiological parameters, fluctuates during the course of a 24-hour period. However, most studies have based their results on the maximal daily IAP value as opposed to the mean or median value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066610396156">10</xref></sup> When the mean IAP value is used, the prevalence and incidence of IAH/ACS can be affected by the number of IAP measurements done during the course of a 24-hour period. Malbrain et al suggests using the maximum IAP for diagnosis of IAP/ACS, as the “worst” value should guide treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066610396156">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The incidence of IAH and ACS varies with the patient population studied. In patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant, the incidence of IAH (defined as an IAP &gt;25 mm Hg) was 32%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066610396156">11</xref></sup> In contrast, among general medical–surgical patients the incidence of ACS has been reported to be 4% to 8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066610396156">9</xref></sup> In the setting of trauma, early studies reported a low incidence of ACS (as low as 0.5% in some case series).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066610396156">12</xref></sup> More recent studies report an incidence as high as 14% (6% primary and 8% secondary).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066610396156">13</xref></sup> Abdominal compartment syndrome has been described in burn and pediatric patients, with an incidence of 1% to 20% and 0.6% to 19%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066610396156">9</xref></sup> Other causes include intra-abdominal infection, pancreatitis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066610396156">14</xref></sup> and retroperitoneal bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066610396156">15</xref></sup> In short, ACS is a syndrome that can occur in a broad range of patient populations with a variable incidence.</p>
<p>Factors associated with the development of ACS are heterogeneous and thus, a specific clinical rule to guide clinicians has not been developed. Balogh et al, however, identified anemia, hypothermia, and increased base deficit as independent factors associated with the development of primary ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066610396156">13</xref></sup> In contrast, hemorrhage, high-volume resuscitation, and multiple transfusions are associated with the development of secondary ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066610396156">16</xref></sup> Raeburn et al found that the likelihood of ACS development postoperatively was not dependent on preoperative fluid resuscitation or transfusion requirements but rather on peak airway pressure (PAP) after decompressive laparotomy (DL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066610396156">17</xref></sup> In a matched cohort study of 22 nontrauma surgical patients, McNelis et al demonstrated that 24-hour resuscitation volume was associated with ACS, but this association did not predict ACS in a multivariate analysis. However, the net 24-hour fluid balance (FB) and the admission PAP were identified as independent risk factors. Using these variables, McNelis et al developed an equation predictive of the probability (<italic>P</italic>) of ACS development (<italic>P</italic> = 1/[1 + e<sup>−z</sup>], where z = −18.6763 + 0.1671 × (PAP) + 0.0009 × [FB in liters]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066610396156">18</xref></sup> In another prospective trial, Malbrain et al found body mass index (BMI) to be the only factor independently associated with IAH on multivariate analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066610396156">10</xref></sup> Other factors associated with the development of ACS are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885066610396156">Table 3</xref>

<p>The incidence of multiorgan failure (MOF) and mortality is high in patients with ACS. Among trauma patients with ACS, the incidence of MOF is 32% to 55% and the mortality rate is 43% to 64%. In comparison, the incidence of MOF and the mortality rate among trauma patients with equivalent injury severity scores (ISS) who do not develop ACS is 8% to 12% and 12% to 17%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066610396156">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066610396156">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>As summarized above, ACS occurs in a wide range of patients, and there are a multitude of risk factors for the development of ACS. Given the associated morbidity and mortality, the clinician at the bedside must have a low threshold to consider the diagnosis of IAH and the potential development of ACS.</p>

<p>Physical examination has not been shown to be effective at diagnosing the presence or absence of IAH.

<p>Intravesicular pressure (IVP) is the current gold standard for noninvasive IAP measurement. The pressure is obtained using a transducer connected to the specimen-collection port of a Foley catheter after the catheter has been clamped distal to the port site. Different authors recommend instilling various amounts of saline into the bladder prior to obtaining IAP measurements; volumes range from 0 to 250 mL in animal studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066610396156">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066610396156">24</xref></sup> The instillation of saline is meant to eliminate air bubbles in the bladder and catheter system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066610396156">24</xref></sup> Fusco et al demonstrated that the instilled volume affects IAP measurements. A volume of 0 mL demonstrates the least bias in the setting of low IAPs, while a volume of 50 mL results in the least bias at pressures of 25 mm Hg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885066610396156">25</xref></sup>; thus, Malbrain recommends instilling 50 mL of saline to improve the accuracy of IVP in measuring IAP. Ideally, the bladder should be fully emptied before the instillation of this volume of saline, but radiological studies show that even in the presence of a catheter, the bladder is often not completely empty. Malbrain, in a review, recommends a continuous dynamic monitoring system via a gastric route for those at high risk of elevated IAP and ACS development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066610396156">22</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>When measuring IVP, one must keep in mind that the abdominal cavity is not a completely fluid-filled cavity and does not have a constant pressure regardless of position. Instead, the cavity contains solid organs and gas-containing bowel that have an intrinsic weight; thus, changes in position affect IAPs. Patients, particularly those that are obese, should be completely supine when IAP measurements are being done. The pressure transducer also must be zeroed at the iliac crest in the mid-axillary line (analogous to the symphysis pubis) for more accurate monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066610396156">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066610396156">22</xref></sup> Transducer malposition due to patient repositioning may affect IAP measurement. One must also keep in mind that abdominal muscle contraction and low bladder compliance may overestimate IAPs. In order to reduce the effect of abdominal muscle contraction during the respiratory cycle on IAP measurements, it is generally recommended to take the measurements at end expiration when the abdominal muscles are relaxed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066610396156">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066610396156"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066610396156">24</xref></sup> It is also recommended to measure IAP at least 30 to 60 seconds after the instillation of saline into the bladder to allow for detrusor muscle relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885066610396156">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0885066610396156">Table 5</xref>

<p>Intra-abdominal pressure may be measured directly with an intraperitoneal catheter attached to a manometer or transducer, but clinically direct measurement of IAP is impractical and unnecessary. Indirect techniques of measuring IAP include rectal, inferior vena caval, gastric, and IVP measurements. Rectal pressure measurements do not correlate with directly measured IAP in animal models, and while inferior vena caval pressure measurements do correlate, they are invasive with significant risk of injury and venous thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885066610396156">27</xref></sup> Early animal models showed poor correlation between intermittent gastric pressure and directly measured IAP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885066610396156">27</xref></sup> but early human studies suggested an acceptable correlation between intermittent gastric pressure and urinary pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885066610396156">28</xref></sup> The validity and reliability of gastric pressures have been confirmed by studies of continuous gastric pressure monitors in in vitro and animal models of monitoring IAP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885066610396156">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885066610396156">30</xref></sup>

<p>Traditional methods of monitoring IAP rely on intermittent IAP measurements using indwelling bladder catheters and have shown good correlation with direct measurement of IAP in canine models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066610396156">23</xref></sup> Intra-abdominal pressure measurements, however, are only “snapshots” of a dynamic parameter; thus, they may not reflect the patient’s true clinical status and may delay the recognition of IAH. Continuous monitoring of IAP, like other pressures, provides the clinician with the greatest insight into the patient’s evolving condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066610396156">22</xref></sup> From a nursing standpoint, continuous monitors tend to be less labor-intensive than intermittent IAPs. Also, continuous pressure monitoring eliminates the many variables that affect IIAP measurements described above. Recently, several methods of continuous IAP (CIAP) monitoring have been developed. One method is continuous urinary bladder pressure measurement using a 3-way catheter. Balogh et al and McBeth et al demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of this method in trauma patients and in an in vitro model, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885066610396156">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885066610396156">32</xref></sup> Using a porcine model in 2003, Schachtrupp et al also found a good correlation between continuous gastric pressure monitoring and direct IAP measurements. The gastric pressures were measured with nasogastric catheters equipped with either a piezoresistive probe or air capsule at the tip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885066610396156">29</xref></sup> While both methods correlated well with IAPs, the air pouch method had the least bias. Using an in vitro model of IAP, Malbrain et al recently demonstrated the validity, reliability, and accuracy of 2 novel catheters that apply this air capsule method of intragastric pressure monitoring (Spiegelberg and CiMON techniques).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885066610396156">30</xref></sup> This method is currently being tested on patients in Europe.</p>

) but also causes derangements at the cellular levels mainly due to neutrophil priming. Neutrophil priming is the enhancement of the neutrophil response to a given stimulus following initial exposure to a different stimulus, so the subsequent activation results in an exaggerated response. Neutrophils in injured patients are primed for cytotoxicity (platelet-activating factor [PAF], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α], and lipopolysaccharide [LPS] have been studied as priming agents) through the postinjury activation of p38 mitogen-activating protein kinase (p38 MAPK).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885066610396156">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885066610396156">34</xref></sup> Priming initiates the surface expression of the adhesion molecule CD11b/CD18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885066610396156">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885066610396156">35</xref></sup> Some studies suggest that ACS-provoked organ dysfunction is mediated by primed neutrophils, endothelial cells, and tissue macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885066610396156">36</xref></sup> Proinflammatory cytokines activate such primed neutrophils resulting in extended superoxide generation and protease release.

<p>Animal and human data demonstrate an interaction between intracranial hypertension (ICH) and IAH. In 1996 and 1997, Bloomfield and colleagues demonstrated in porcine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0885066610396156">55</xref></sup> and swine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885066610396156">56</xref></sup> models that IAH causes ICH by increasing the intrathoracic and central venous pressures (CVP), causing functional obstruction of the cerebral venous outflow. This study further demonstrated that either a median sternotomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885066610396156">56</xref></sup> or a DL was effective in normalizing cerebral venous outflow and ICP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0885066610396156">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885066610396156">56</xref></sup> Human studies have shown similar outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885066610396156">48</xref></sup> Using continuous negative applied pressure (CNAP) on a swine model, Saggi et al demonstrated the effectiveness of nonsurgical abdominal decompression in reducing ICP in the setting of IAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885066610396156">57</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The effect of nonsurgical abdominal decompression on ICP has not been evaluated in humans. However, a retrospective study of DL in 17 patients with intractable ICH and IAH demonstrated a reduction of CVP and ICPs by at least 10 mm Hg in all patients and a sustained reduction was observed in 11 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0885066610396156">58</xref></sup> Nonsurvivors had no sustained reduction in CVPs and only a modest, transient decrease in ICPs. The absence of a decrease in CVP following DL may be a poor prognostic factor. Survivors and nonsurvivors had similar injury severity and abbreviated severity scores as well as similar initial ICPs. Interestingly, the 11 survivors were decompressed when the IAPs exceeded 20 mm Hg and before developing symptoms of ACS. Nonsurvivors had overt ACS at the time of abdominal decompression. Given these findings, Joseph et al suggested that ICH may actually be the first manifestation of ACS and that early abdominal decompression may be a useful approach to such difficult cases. Broad application of this technique is not warranted until larger cohorts of patients have been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0885066610396156">58</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In patients with cerebral hypertension and IAH, the cerebral hypertension should be initially managed medically with hyperosmolar fluids, mannitol, elevation of head of bed, hyperventilation (refractory ICH), cerebrospinal fluid drainage, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) maintenance with inotropic support to maintain CPP &gt;70, paralysis, and barbiturate-induced coma. In patients with intractable ICH, a decompressive crainiectomy may be considered, but the morbidity of this approach is quite significant. In patients with both intractable ICH and IAH, abdominal decompression may be a useful mitigating strategy. This option is more attractive because the morbidity of DL has significantly improved with the use of a vacuum-assisted closure device with increased fascial closure rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0885066610396156">59</xref></sup> While DL may help reduce ICP, laparoscopy may elevate it because of the insufflation of the abdominal compartment.

<p>Intra-abdominal hypertension causes decreased venous return to the heart by direct compression on the inferior vena cava (IVC). In a canine model, resistance to venous return is highest at the sub-diaphragmatic, supra-hepatic IVC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885066610396156">61</xref></sup> Impairment of venous return occurs at pressures of 15 mm Hg or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885066610396156">62</xref></sup> In this model, an IAP between 10 and 15 mm Hg was shown to increase venous return as blood from abdominal capacitance vessels is mobilized into the IVC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885066610396156">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0885066610396156">63</xref></sup> The decrease in caval return also causes a decrease in venous outflow from the lower extremities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885066610396156">64</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0885066610396156"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0885066610396156">66</xref></sup> There is no proven association between deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and IAH, but the relative stasis of blood flow may be a significant risk factor for DVT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0885066610396156">66</xref></sup> Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is an important consideration in this patient population, and inferior vena caval filter placement should be considered in patients with IAH who cannot be treated with pharmacological prophylaxis. Pneumatic compression devices in this patient population may be especially beneficial. With the use of duplex imaging on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and volunteers undergoing external abdominal pressure of 50 mm Hg, Christen and colleagues were able to demonstrate intermittent restoration of femoral vein flow velocity with pneumatic compression with no effect on femoral vein diameter or pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885066610396156">64</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>As a consequence of IAH, venous return is decreased often resulting in a decrease in cardiac output (CO). In order to maintain stroke volume, a compensatory increase in heart rate is typically seen. As demonstrated by several animal studies, substantial diaphragmatic elevation due to IAH causes further decreases in CO by increasing intrathoracic and pleural pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885066610396156">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885066610396156">68</xref></sup> Increased intrathoracic pressure adversely affect CO by several mechanisms. First, the increased pressure increases systemic vascular resistance and afterload.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885066610396156">67</xref></sup> In this setting, a drop in CO may still be accompanied by an increased or unchanged mean arterial pressure. Second, the increased pressure decreases the transmural filling pressure for a given ventricular end-diastolic pressure, thus decreasing the corresponding ventricular end-diastolic volume for a given ventricular compliance. However, ventricular compliance itself also decreases as intrathoracic pressure increases (&gt;30 mm Hg) and causes direct compression on the heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885066610396156">62</xref></sup> Increased intrathoracic pressure and direct ventricular compression may not only affect ventricular compliance but also disrupt contractility.

<p>Decreases in CO in the setting of IAH can be further exacerbated by hypovolemia, inhalational anesthesia, elevated positive end expiratory pressures (PEEPs), and myocardial dysfunction.

<p>The increased intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures not only adversely affect patient’s hemodynamics but also disrupt interpretation of hemodynamic variables. Multiple studies demonstrate that measured filling pressures (eg, CVP, PAP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]) are unreliable in patients with IAH. Typically, these measured filling pressures are elevated due to the increased thoracoabdominal pressures which can fool the clinician into believing that the patient is intravascularly replete when in fact just the opposite is true.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885066610396156">67</xref></sup> Using the double-indicator dilution technique on a porcine model, Schachtrupp et al found that a 24-hour exposure to IAPs of 30 mm Hg increased CVP 4-fold while decreasing intrathoracic and total circulating blood volumes by 55% and 67%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0885066610396156">74</xref></sup> This study illustrates that the CVP does not necessarily reflect the intravascular volume depletion that often accompanies IAH.

<p>Intra-abdominal hypertension also increases the risk of ventilator-associated barotrauma.

<p>Intra-abdominal hypertension promotes the development of pulmonary edema, especially in the setting of coexisting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

A pneumoperitoneum of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O significantly lowered the gas content in both healthy and oleic acid injury lungs but significantly more so with the latter. While the same amount of pneumoperitoneum did not increase the mass of healthy lungs, the excess tissue mass (edema) in oleic acid injured lungs amounted to 30% ± 24% of the original tissue weight.

<p>The increased propensity for pulmonary edema in the setting of IAH may be due to increased intrathoracic pressure and subsequent increase in intra-avleolar and interstitial fluid formation as well as decrease in fluid clearance.

<title>Gastrointestinal and Hepatic</title>
<p>Intra-abdominal hypertension has multiple hepatic and gastrointestinal effects. It can cause intestinal edema by impairing lymphatic flow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0885066610396156">84</xref></sup> but it imparts its most substantial effect on the gastrointestinal tract and liver by causing mesenteric hypoperfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885066610396156">42</xref></sup> Mesenteric perfusion is dependent on APP. Abdominal perfusion pressure is defined as the mean abdominal pressure (MAP) minus the IAP (APP = MAP − IAP). In patients with ACS, maintaining APP at 50 mm Hg or more correlates with better survival. Abdominal perfusion pressure has been demonstrated to be a better marker than MAP, IAP, arterial pH, base deficit, arterial lactate, and urine output in predicting survival from IAH and ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885066610396156">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0885066610396156">86</xref></sup>

<p>Animal studies suggest that mesenteric arterial flow (MAF), intestinal mucosal flow (IMF), hepatic arterial flow (HAF), hepatic microcirculatory flow (HMF), and portal venous blood flow (PVF) all decrease in the setting of raised IAP. In a porcine model, Diebel et al showed that even in the face of a normal CO and systemic blood pressure, HAF, HMF, and PVF fell at IAPs as low as 10 mm Hg. At 20 mm Hg IAP, HAF was 45% of the control value, PVF was 65%, and HMF was 71%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885066610396156">42</xref></sup> Reductions in MAF and IMF are only seen at IAPs of 20 mm Hg or higher. Unlike the liver which has dual blood supply (systemic arterial and portal venous), in the intestine, the microcirculatory blood flow is more susceptible to IAH than the main arterial blood flow, with a 39% IMF reduction seen at an IAP of 10 mm Hg as opposed to only a 27% MAF reduction seen at the same pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0885066610396156">87</xref></sup> The deleterious effects of raised IAP on intestinal perfusion have been reflected in multiple studies including 6 case reports of fatal intestinal infarction following laparoscopic cholecystectomies. In those cases, bowel ischemia was most pronounced at the ileum and right colon and may be due to splanchnic hypoperfusion, superior mesenteric arterial thrombosis, or inferior mesenteric venous thrombosis (seen more commonly in those patients with atherosclerotic and peripheral vascular disease).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885066610396156">88</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0885066610396156"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0885066610396156"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885066610396156"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0885066610396156"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0885066610396156">93</xref></sup>

<p>Intestinal mucosal hypoperfusion causes mucosal acidosis that is quantifiable by gastric tonometry.

</p>
<p>Hemorrhagic shock resulting in intestinal and hepatic ischemia can lead to sepsis and MOF due to cytokine release and bacterial translocation. Bacterial translocation is the movement of viable enteric bacteria through a permeable mucosal barrier to mesenteric lymph nodes, then to the liver and spleen and then eventually to the systemic circulation. Deitch et al demonstrated that hypoperfusion-induced mucosal permeability is not potentiated by the presence of enteric bacteria; in their study, rats with normal gut flora and antibiotic-decontaminated rats had the same intestinal histopathological changes and the same mucosal permeability to horseradish peroxidase after 2 and 24 hours of hemorrhagic shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0885066610396156">100</xref></sup> Since then, subsequent studies have successfully demonstrated bacterial translocation in the setting IAH-induced intestinal ischemia.

<p>In addition to intestinal hypoperfusion, mucosal ischemia/acidosis, and bacterial translocation, IAH due to ascites in patients with cirrhosis can exacerbate preexisting portal hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux. Rasmussen et al demonstrated in pigs a marked increase in hepatic and portal vascular resistance with IAH &gt;15 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0885066610396156">106</xref></sup> In support of the notion that the risk of variceal bleeding is increased in patients with higher IAPs, a group of Spanish gastroenterologists demonstrated a significant increase in variceal pressure, radius, volume, and wall tension in 14 patients with cirrhosis in whom IAPs were increased by only 10 mm Hg using inflatable girdles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0885066610396156">107</xref></sup>

<p>Abdominal hypertension clearly has deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal and hepatic systems, starting with hypoperfusion and acidosis, then resulting in bacterial translocation and eventual sepsis and MOF.

<p>The mechanism of renal dysfunction in IAH is the result of reduced renal arterial flow and glomerular filtration rate due to increased renal arteriolar and venous resistance. In a 1982 study, using anesthetized dogs, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate decreased to less than 25% of normal, when the IAP was increased to 20 mm Hg using inflatable intraperitoneal bags. When the IAP was raised to 40 mm Hg, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) dropped to 7% of baseline. Expansion of the blood volume using Dextran corrected the initial drop in CO at 40 mm Hg IAP, but renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate remained less than 25% of normal. Renal vascular resistance increased 555% when IAP was elevated to 20 mm Hg, an increase 15-fold that of systemic vascular resistance. This suggests that the renal dysfunction in the setting of IAH is caused by direct renal vein and cortical arteriole compression and is not related to CO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885066610396156">111</xref></sup> The results of this initial animal study have been validated by subsequent studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0885066610396156">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0885066610396156">113</xref></sup> Ureteral occlusion by IAH does not seem to be an important factor in ACS since renal function does not appear to improve with bilateral ureteral stent placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0885066610396156">114</xref></sup>

<p>Intra-abdominal hypertension is of particular relevance in patients who have recently received a renal transplant. As the effects of IAP on renal function have become more widely recognized, transplant surgeons have become increasingly concerned of the effects of pneumoperitoneum on donor kidneys during laparoscopic donor nephrectomies (LDNs).

<p>The best approach to ACS is prevention. This involves frequent IAP monitoring, determining accurate goal-directed resuscitation end points, and avoiding overresuscitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0885066610396156">132</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0885066610396156">133</xref></sup> In the setting of IAH, lactate levels, base deficit, and central venous oxygen saturations are all variables that may be used in guiding resuscitation. In contrast, urine output and central venous pressure may be misleading because they are directly affected by IAP as well as intravascular volume. Continuous RVEDVI, GEDVI, ITBV, and CI monitoring may be used as they are more precise measures of ventricular preload in the setting of IAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0885066610396156">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0885066610396156">83</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Strategies aimed at reducing crystalloid resuscitation may avoid excessive volume administration and help prevent IAH. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials from the 1970s and 1980s failed to show any benefit of colloid versus crystalloid resuscitation for trauma and burns in terms of organ dysfunction and mortality overall, but there was a trend for decreased mortality in the trauma subgroup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0885066610396156">134</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0885066610396156">135</xref></sup> Abdominal compartment syndrome was not recognized as a clinical entity until the mid 1980s, so whether colloid use may help limit fluid administration and prevent ACS is unknown.</p>
<p>Prevention of primary ACS in high-risk surgical patients often starts in the operating room with temporary abdominal closures that allow abdominal contents to expand freely as opposed to definitive fascial closures that can be restrictive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0885066610396156">136</xref></sup> This concept of “staged damage-control laparotomy” has recently gained greater acceptance. Key to this concept is that prolonged operative time and extensive surgical repair in the setting of abdominal trauma, hemorrhage, or septic shock only invites the vicious cycle of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0885066610396156">137</xref></sup> In order to break this cycle and promote patient survival, surgical bleeding must be rapidly controlled and salvage procedures must be quickly applied followed by prompt temporary abdominal closure and expedited patient transfer to the intensive care unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0885066610396156">137</xref></sup> In nondamage-control cases (eg, stable patient with secondary peritonitis), the abdomen may need to be left open if the patient clearly demonstrates high PAPs on reapproximation of the fascia, predicting high risk of postoperative ACS. Raeburn et al, after examining several variables at the end of a laparotomy, found that only PAP is predictive of ACS development and does not preclude its development with bag closures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066610396156">17</xref></sup> Temporary abdominal closure techniques include a towel clip skin closure with fascial edges not approximated; an opened sterile intravenous bag (Bogata bag) closure; a synthetic patch placement; a vacuum pack closure; and a modified sandwich-vacuum pack, using a 3-L urological irrigation bag and continuous high-pressure suction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0885066610396156">138</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0885066610396156">139</xref></sup> While such temporary closures may reduce the incidence of ACS, they are not absolutely preventative. This has been reported with the use of the vacuum closures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885066610396156">Figure 1</xref>
) which may so efficiently contain the abdominal contents that it allows for IAP increases with postoperative third-spacing and visceral edema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0885066610396156">140</xref></sup> Because of this phenomenon, known as open abdomen ACS, it is imperative to allow for additional bowel swelling during temporary abdominal closure and to continue IAP monitoring in patients with open abdomens. For patients with open abdomens who do develop ACS, mortality is quite high. The IAH must be addressed promptly by releasing the temporary abdominal closure and allowing further expansion and eventration of the abdominal viscera prior to the placement of new abdominal closure drape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0885066610396156">140</xref></sup> High crystalloid requirements (&gt;10 L), may predict whom will go on to develop secondary ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0885066610396156">140</xref></sup>

<p>Intra-abdominal hypertension must be treated when ACS is clinically evident—that is, when IAP is greater than 20 to 25 mm Hg in association with hypotension, raised airway pressures, impaired ventilation, or oliguria. Treatment of IAH of 15 to 20 mm Hg must be considered in high-risk patients prior to the clinical onset of ACS. Examples include patients with intractable ICH or those with clinical evidence of intestinal ischemia (low ipH, high serum <sc>d</sc>-lactate levels in the setting of adequate blood pressure, or dusky bowel seen through a silastic closure).</p>
<p>The definitive treatment of IAH is DL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0885066610396156">141</xref></sup> The treatment is almost always effective typically associated with a rapid improvement in airway pressures, partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli/fraction of inspired oxygen (P<sc>ao</sc>
<sub>2</sub>/F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) ratio, and urine output,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0885066610396156">142</xref></sup> but the effects of DL on organ function are variable with mortality as a whole at 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0885066610396156">141</xref></sup> In patients who are clinically unstable, it may be performed at the bedside.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0885066610396156">143</xref></sup> Some authors have suggested using volume, mannitol, and/or sodium bicarbonate prior to DL to counteract the sudden drop in vascular resistance and the possible visceral reperfusion injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0885066610396156">72</xref></sup>; however, this strategy remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0885066610396156">144</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>When the patient is ready for abdominal closure (hemodynamically stable, resolved sepsis, and reduced IAPs), removal of excess fluids by diuresis or hemofiltration is critical in reducing tissue edema and allowing wound closure. While the opportunity for primary fascial closure varies from one patient to another, generally it is not possible after 7 days due to the development of significant adhesions and granulation tissue that produce a “frozen abdomen.” Primary fascial closure is more likely with sequential incremental closures or with increasing tension on the temporary closure as edema resolves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0885066610396156">145</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0885066610396156"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0885066610396156">147</xref></sup> Definitive fascial closure may be possible in a delayed setting with component separation (CS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0885066610396156">148</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0885066610396156">149</xref></sup> If fascial closure is not possible, then the wound may be closed with an allograft (Alloderm) or a xenograft (Strattice/Permacol) with or without CS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0885066610396156">150</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0885066610396156">151</xref></sup> Short-term follow-up in these patients have suggested a high rate of hernia formation and increased closure costs. Alternatively, the wound may be allowed to close by secondary intention, with expectation of hernia development. Healing and closure in those cases can be expedited with the use of a vacuum-assisted closure device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0885066610396156">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0885066610396156">146</xref></sup> or partial-thickness skin grafting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0885066610396156">152</xref></sup> once enough healthy granulation tissue has bridged the wound.</p>
<p>While abdominal decompression initially decreases patient perception of physical, social, and emotional health, subsequent abdominal wall reconstruction restores patient’s physical and mental health. Abdominal decompression does not prevent return to gainful employment and should not be considered a permanently disabling condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0885066610396156">153</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Open abdomens are associated with a 20% to 78% rate of unsuccessful reclosure in addition to a high risk of enterocutaneous fistulas and ventral hernias. In an attempt to avoid these complications, clinicians have pursued alternative methods to IAP reduction. Invasive alternatives to DL include paracentesis (for patients with large amounts of ascites) and endoscopic CS. For the former approach, bedside ultrasound may be helpful in identifying a safe window for catheter placement. While paracentesis has been reported to be a successful treatment for ACS in burn patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0885066610396156">154</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0885066610396156">155</xref></sup> animal studies have shown it to be ineffective in reducing cerebral hypertension associated with IAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0885066610396156">156</xref></sup> Paracentesis, in the few times that it is successful, produces a prompt and impressive clinical response; when that does not happen following catheter placement or if IAH recurs due to catheter malfunction, a more definitive treatment (ie, DL) must be considered. In endoscopic CS, the abdominal fascia is released through small laparoscopic skin incisions. While yet to be studied on humans, this “low-morbidity” approach has been shown to be feasible and effective in a porcine model of IAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0885066610396156">157</xref></sup> However, the effectiveness of this approach is likely to be short-term since the intact skin limits abdominal expansion and promotes increases in IAP.</p>
<p>There is a myriad of noninvasive treatment options for raised IAH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0885066610396156">Table 7</xref>
). Sedation and neuromuscular blockade are the mainstay medical therapy for IAH. The effect of paralysis on IAP has been documented in the literature to postpone increases in IAP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0885066610396156">158</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0885066610396156">159</xref></sup> Opioids, on the other hand, may acutely raise IAP by promoting active phasic expiration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0885066610396156">160</xref></sup> As long as visceral perfusion and oxygen delivery is not compromised, removal of excessive fluids by diuresis, hemofiltration, and/or ultrafiltration is another effective medical treatment for IAH. In patients with significant gaseous bowel distension, the use of prokinetics, nasogastric decompression, rectal drainage, or enemas may sustain minor reductions in IAP. These approaches, however, must be used cautiously in patients with bowel pathology. Similarly, avoiding acute hip flexion and positioning the patient in a reverse trendelenburg, prone, or semi-recumbent position may prevent further increases in the IAP. One last noninvasive option is the use of CNAP to the abdominal wall. While at this time there is limited experience with this technique on humans, animal studies suggest that the method is effective in reducing elevated intra-abdominal and cerebral pressures associated with IAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885066610396156">57</xref></sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The prompt diagnosis and management of IAH is critical to the management of patients at risk of ACS. Routine and frequent IAP measuring is the cornerstone of this approach. These measurements allow for prompt medical therapy before the negative consequences of ACS occur and allow for surgical decompression or other less invasive procedures before end organ damage develops. The early recognition of IAH also avoids underresuscitation by recognizing artificially elevated filling pressures. The early detection of IAH may also provide therapeutic options for patients with intractable ICH. The pathophysiological consequences of IAH are significant and, if left untreated, often progress to MOF and death.</p>

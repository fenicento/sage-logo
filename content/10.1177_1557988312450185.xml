<abstract>
<p>Research examining psychosocial functioning in African American prostate cancer survivors has been limited, in spite of documented higher mortality from prostate cancer and worse long-term physical and emotional outcomes from prostate cancer treatment reported by this group of survivors. In addition, the role of masculinity in psychosocial adjustment among prostate cancer survivors is not well understood. In this study, 59 African American prostate cancer survivors completed a questionnaire assessing masculinity beliefs related to self-reliance, emotional control, and dominance, as well as measures of psychosocial functioning (i.e., symptom distress, negative mood, and functional and social well-being). Results of regression analyses indicated that masculinity beliefs predicted negative mood, functional well-being, and social well-being, controlling for age, income, and medical comorbidities. The findings reported here, although preliminary, suggest that masculinity beliefs could be important therapeutic targets for improving the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions for men adjusting to prostate cancer survivorship.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostate cancer disparities have been well documented for African American men, including a 60% higher incidence rate, later stage at diagnosis, and a mortality rate that is more than twice that of Caucasian men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557988312450185">American Cancer Society, 2011</xref>). To address these disparities, medical research has focused increasingly on early diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer among African American men, resulting in increased survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557988312450185">American Cancer Society, 2011</xref>). However, little attention has been paid to posttreatment survivorship issues where disparities have been documented. African American men report slower recovery from prostate cancer treatment, more dissatisfaction, and regret following prostatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557988312450185">Schroeck et al., 2008</xref>); more persistent problems with sexual, urinary, and bowel symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557988312450185">Lubeck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557988312450185">National Cancer Institute, 2004</xref>); and greater emotional distress in response to having cancer compared with Caucasian men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312450185">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557988312450185">Rodrigue, 1997</xref>). In spite of the evidence that African American men experience worse long-term physical and emotional outcomes from prostate cancer, research examining psychosocial functioning in African American prostate cancer survivors has been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557988312450185">Weber &amp; Sherwill-Navarro, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One variable that is potentially quite important, but that has not been addressed in prior work with African American prostate cancer survivors, is conformity to majority culture norms on masculinity (often termed <italic>traditional masculinity</italic>). Such norms include emotional control, self-reliance, and social dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557988312450185">Mahalik, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557988312450185">Mahalik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557988312450185">Lazur &amp; Majors, 1995</xref>). Men who have been treated for prostate cancer often experience physical symptoms (e.g., sexual or urinary dysfunction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557988312450185">Litwin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557988312450185">Potosky et al., 2000</xref>) and can experience related emotional difficulties (e.g., depression, heightened emotionality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557988312450185">Weber &amp; Sherwill-Navarro, 2005</xref>) and social changes (e.g., social isolation, concerns about losing intimate relationships) that conflict with these common beliefs about masculinity. As a result, survivors may perceive a diminished sense of manhood, which could have a negative impact on their psychosocial functioning.</p>
<p>Previous research suggests that men who conform to more traditional views of masculinity report increased emotional distress, including higher depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557988312450185">Good et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557988312450185">Courneyer &amp; Mahalik, 1995</xref>). African American prostate cancer survivors may be particularly vulnerable in the face of a threatened sense of manhood since they are caught in a bind between maintaining a strong masculine image consistent with the majority culture as a buffer against racism, powerlessness, and socioeconomic disadvantage on the one hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557988312450185">Mahalik, Pierre, &amp; Wan, 2007</xref>) and accommodating the realities of their illness on the other. However, researchers are only just beginning to explore how masculinity beliefs affect prostate cancer survivorship.</p>
<p>An earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557988312450185">Burns and Mahalik (2006)</xref> reported that, in a sample of 230 men treated for prostate cancer, men with poor physical health who held more strongly to traditional masculinity views about self-reliance and emotional control reported much worse mental health. In contrast, men with poor physical health who believed less strongly in traditional masculine norms related to self-reliance and emotional control reported much better mental health. However, in this study there were only six African American men in the sample (3%), which limits the extent to which these findings can be generalized to African American prostate cancer survivors.</p>
<p>Another study of masculine conformity and psychological functioning by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557988312450185">Mahalik et al. (2007)</xref> employed a larger sample of African American men (aged 18-25 years). The results of this study indicated that greater conformity to traditional masculine norms was associated with lower self-esteem and higher psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557988312450185">Mahalik et al., 2007</xref>). However, because the participants in this study were young men who were not prostate cancer survivors, the findings may have limited generalizability to middle-aged and older men coping with the physical, emotional, and social challenges of prostate cancer survivorship.</p>
<p>This study addresses the gaps in the research literature noted above by examining conformity to traditional masculinity norms related to self-reliance, emotional control, and social dominance in a sample of middle-aged and older African American prostate cancer survivors. Specifically, this study examines how variations in masculinity beliefs are related to important indices of psychosocial functioning (symptom distress, self-efficacy for symptom control, negative mood, functional well-being, and social well-being).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1557988312450185" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Duke University Medical Center. All participants underwent the informed consent process and gave written consent prior to participating in this study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1557988312450185">
<title>Participants and Eligibility</title>
<p>Participants were African American prostate cancer survivors who received active treatment (i.e., surgery, radiation, hormone therapy) for localized prostate cancer within the previous 2 years. Eligibility was confirmed by each participant’s physician.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1557988312450185">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>An important recruitment aim of this study was to reach an economically diverse population of African American men, including the economically disadvantaged and the medically underserved. To achieve this aim, recruitment was carried out in both clinical settings and through community outreach. Clinic-based recruitment was coordinated through the Duke University Medical Center Prostate Center. Community recruitment involved comprehensive outreach using newspaper and web-based advertising and community-based prostate cancer advocates serving African American communities. As a result, 37% of participants were self-referred in response to our outreach efforts. Sixty-three percent of participants were clinic-referred.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1557988312450185">
<title>Demographic information</title>
<p>Demographic data collected included participant age, education, income, prostate cancer treatment modality (e.g., surgery or radiation), and comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1557988312450185">
<title>Masculine conformity</title>
<p>Masculine Conformity was assessed using three subscales (21 items) of the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory (CMNI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557988312450185">Mahalik et al., 2003</xref>), which assess the extent to which an individual desires to conform to masculinity norms related to emotional control, self-reliance, and pursuit of power/dominance. The CMNI has demonstrated validity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557988312450185">Mahalik et al., 2003</xref>). Reliability coefficients (Cronbach’s αs) for CMNI subscales for the current study were .82 for the emotional control subscale, .72 for the self-reliance subscale, and .56 for the dominance subscale. Alpha coefficients are reported similarly for all other study measures described below.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-1557988312450185">
<title>Measures of Psychosocial Functioning</title>
<p><italic>Symptom distress</italic> was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557988312450185">Wei, Dunn, Litwin, Sandler, &amp; Sanda, 2000</xref>). The EPIC is a 50-item scale that assesses symptom severity and symptom distress in sexual, urinary, and bowel symptom domains related to prostate cancer treatment. Sexual Bother, Urinary Bother, and Bowel Bother subscales of the EPIC were used to assess Symptom Distress. Higher scores on these scales reflect less symptom distress. Each of these subscales has demonstrated good internal consistency in African American prostate cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312450185">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>). In the current study, Cronbach α coefficients were .78 for the urinary bother subscale, .75 for the bowel bother subscale, and .72 for the sexual bother subscale.</p>
<p><italic>Self-efficacy for symptom control</italic> was assessed using a modified version of a standard self-efficacy scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557988312450185">Lorig, Chastain, Ung, Shoor, &amp; Holman, 1989</xref>). This 22-item self-efficacy scale has shown good reliability in previous research with African American prostate cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312450185">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>) and includes three subscales: symptom management self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in managing cancer-related symptoms), coping-self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in coping with emotional aspects of cancer), and functional self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in one’s ability to function in spite of symptoms). In the current study, all three self-efficacy subscales demonstrated excellent reliability. The coefficient αs were .92 for symptom management self-efficacy, .96 for coping self-efficacy, and .95 for functional self-efficacy.</p>
<p><italic>Negative mood</italic> was assessed using the depression and tension (i.e., anxiety) subscales of the Profile of Mood States-SF (POMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557988312450185">Lorr &amp; McNair, 1982</xref>). Higher scores on these POMS-SF subscales indicate more distress. The POMS has been used previously in prostate cancer research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557988312450185">Clarke &amp; Talcott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557988312450185">Ulrich, Carson, Lutgendorf, &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>) and demonstrated good reliability in the current study sample, with α coefficients of .82 (Depression subscale) and .74 (Tension subscale).</p>
<p><italic>Functional well-being</italic> was measured using the Functional Well-being subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557988312450185">Cella et al., 1993</xref>). This subscale includes seven items that assess survivors’ ability to carry out life activities that can be negatively affected by cancer treatment (e.g., work, leisure activities). Evidence supports the reliability of this subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557988312450185">Cella et al., 1993</xref>). In the current study, the functional well-being subscale demonstrated good internal consistency with a coefficient α of .86.</p>
<p><italic>Social well-being</italic> was measured using the seven-item Social/Family Well-being subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557988312450185">Cella et al., 1993</xref>). This subscale assesses survivors’ perceived support from family and friends. In the current study, the α coefficient for the social well-being subscale was .71.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1557988312450185">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Correlational analyses were conducted to identify associations between demographic variables and key study variables and among key study variables. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were then conducted to evaluate how well masculine conformity predicted symptom distress, self-efficacy for symptom control, negative mood, and physical and social functioning, over and above demographic factors. For each regression model, demographic variables found to be significantly correlated with measures of masculine conformity and psychosocial functioning were entered into the model first, followed by masculine conformity indices.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>A total of 59 participants completed a baseline questionnaire battery as part of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing two supportive care interventions. The mean age of participants was 61.2 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.3). Most participants were married or partnered (85%) and received prostate surgery as their primary form of treatment (64%). Forty-three percent of participants were college graduates, 44% were working full-time or part-time, and 80% of participants reported middle-income levels or higher.

<title>Demographic variables and key study variables</title>
<p>Several significant correlations were observed between demographic and key study variables; however, none of the correlations should be interpreted as implying causality.</p>
<p>First, older participants reported stronger masculinity beliefs about emotional control and less urinary symptom distress. Second, participants reporting a higher income level also reported higher functional self-efficacy (<italic>r</italic> = .52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and functional well-being (<italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and lower levels of depression (<italic>r</italic> = −.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Third, patients with a greater number of medical comorbidities also reported lower symptom management self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy, and functional self-efficacy (<italic>r</italic> = −.36, −.34, and −.43, respectively; all <italic>p</italic> values &lt; .01), functional well-being (<italic>r</italic> = −.294, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and more depressed mood (<italic>r</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In sum, of the demographic variables examined, age, income, and medical comorbidities were each related to one or more measures of masculine conformity and psychosocial functioning.</p>

<p>The low alpha coefficient for the Dominance subscale (.56) identified in this study suggests that, in this sample, this subscale may not be reliably capturing the traditional masculinity norm related to dominance. To explore this further, each of the four items in this subscale was correlated with the psychosocial variables. An adjusted α of .005 was used to test for significance (.05/10 subscales). The item “In general, I must get my way” was significantly negatively correlated with physical functioning, <italic>r</italic>(58) = −.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005. The item “I should be in charge” was significantly negatively correlated with physical functioning, <italic>r</italic>(58) = −.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005, and social well-being, <italic>r</italic>(58) = −.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005.

The item “I’m comfortable trying to get my own way” did not correlate with psychosocial variables when using the adjusted alpha level. To promote comparability across other studies using this subscale, we did retain the full Dominance subscale in the analyses but associations between this scale and other study variables are interpreted with caution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is among the first to examine masculine conformity variables as predictors of psychosocial functioning in a sample of African American prostate cancer survivors. When findings of the current study are compared with the previous examination of masculine conformity in a predominantly Caucasian sample of prostate cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557988312450185">Burns &amp; Mahalik, 2006</xref>), both similarities and differences are observed. Like the previous study, the current study found that men who believed more strongly in traditional masculine views about self-reliance reported less favorable mental health (i.e., depressed mood and tension). However, unlike the previous study, stronger traditional views about emotional control were associated with <italic>less</italic> depressed mood and <italic>better</italic> functional well-being. One explanation for these seemingly different findings could be related to cultural and generational differences in how emotional control is expressed. For example, in middle-aged and older African American men, desire for emotional control could lead to denial of sad feelings when asked about such feelings on a self-report measure. Another explanation might be that desire for emotional control stimulates active coping in African American men, leading them to “do” more to distract or distance themselves from the emotional impact of their disease. Staying active may ultimately convey benefits in the form of maintaining functional well-being. However, the extent to which the current study findings reflect cultural differences in enactment of traditional masculinity remains to be examined in future research. Both qualitative and quantitative research with sufficient representation of both African American and Caucasian men are needed to increase our understanding of how socialization and culture influence emotional adjustment and other aspects of quality of life in prostate cancer survivors.</p>
<p>There are study limitations that should be noted. Although the sample size of 59 African American prostate cancer survivors outnumbers African American representation in most prostate cancer research, the sample is still relatively small. Although care was taken to maximize the diversity of the sample with regard to demographic characteristics, a sample of this size may not be representative of the larger population of African American men. Indeed, it should be noted that the educational attainment of the sample (43% college graduates) is greater than the 2010 estimates of educational attainment among African American men aged 25 or older (17.9% college graduates; Current Population Survey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557988312450185">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). Also, the sample size may not have been sufficient to achieve sufficient power for all analyses. Another limitation was the low internal reliability of the dominance subscale. Although this variable was found to predict psychosocial functioning and three of four items in the subscale were correlated with psychosocial variables in exploratory analyses, the relatively weaker internal reliability of the dominance subscale suggests the need to interpret findings related to this predictor variable with caution.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations noted above, the findings reported here could have important implications for development of effective supportive care interventions for African American prostate cancer survivors. Importantly, only a subset of interventions to improve quality of life in prostate cancer survivors has demonstrated substantial benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312450185">Chambers, Pinnock, Lepore, Hughes, &amp; O’Connell, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, intervention studies have not included significant numbers of African American men or focused on masculinity issues beyond sexual functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312450185">Chambers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557988312450185">Molton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557988312450185">Penedo et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, there is little in the psychosocial intervention literature that addresses cultural factors that may shape how masculinity beliefs are enacted by African American prostate cancer survivors and what therapeutic strategies could be effective for promoting adjustment.</p>
<p>The findings reported here, although preliminary, suggest that masculinity beliefs related to self-reliance could be an important therapeutic target for cognitive-behavioral interventions. To the extent that perceived dependence on others is interpreted as diminished masculinity, survivors may avoid asking for needed help and be left alone to deal with the gap between life demands and current capacity to meet those demands. Such men could be at increased risk for anxiety as our findings linking self-reliance and tension/anxiety suggest. Similarly, when dominance or power figure heavily into one’s concept of masculinity, the prostate cancer experience can present challenges (e.g., cutting back or early retirement from a job that allows demonstration of mastery). Perceived loss of power in public arenas could lead to efforts to preserve ones sense of masculinity by exerting more control within the private arena of the home or within close social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557988312450185">Charmaz, 1995</xref>). Based on clinical observations, the result of such efforts at exerting control is often diminished social relationships and greater psychological distress, which is also consistent with our study findings linking dominance beliefs to social functioning and depressed mood.</p>
<p>Masculinity theorists are calling increasingly for psychosocial interventions that address masculinity issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557988312450185">Good et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557988312450185">Mahalik, Talmadge, Locke, &amp; Scott, 2005</xref>) not with the goal of pathologizing manhood but to help men improve their lives in those areas that they value most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557988312450185">Fischer &amp; Good, 1997</xref>). In future studies, cognitive-behavioral techniques may be useful for helping African American prostate cancer survivors and men from other cultural groups to identify important masculinity beliefs and enact these beliefs in ways that are culturally congruent and promote psychosocial adjustment to cancer survivorship.</p>

<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To better understand the relationship between psychosocial stressors and health behaviors in a low-income pediatric sample. <italic>Method</italic>. Participants were 122 children (8-11 years old, 53.3% female) and their parents recruited from a low-income primary care clinic.

<body>
<p>Research indicates that psychosocial stressors may negatively affect physical health outcomes in both adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813482179">1</xref></sup> and children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813482179">2</xref></sup> However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not yet well understood, although both biological and behavioral pathways appear likely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813482179">3</xref></sup> Although the effect of psychosocial stressors on biological mechanisms has been examined, there is a paucity of systematic research focusing on the effect of stressors on key health behaviors, particularly among children. Gaining a greater understanding of the relationship between stressors and key health behaviors is important, given that (1) any negative effects of psychosocial stressors on key health behaviors could contribute to more long-term health issues and (2) health behaviors may be modifiable through health promotion interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813482179">4</xref></sup> As such, the current study examines the association between specific psychosocial stressors and key health behaviors in a low-income pediatric sample.</p>
<p>Evidence for a significant association between psychosocial stressors and health outcomes is considerable. Among children, psychosocial stressors such as financial worries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813482179">5</xref></sup> poor maternal health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813482179">6</xref></sup> and family conflict<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813482179">7</xref></sup> have been linked to negative health outcomes such as poorer health status in general, and obesity, high blood pressure, common physical symptoms (eg, gastrointestinal problems), fatigue, and chronic conditions, specifically. Similar results have been found in adult populations as stressors have been linked with a variety of health conditions (eg, hypertension, heart disease, and gastrointestinal problems).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813482179">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although considerable research links stressors and negative health outcomes for both children and adults, the mechanisms underlying this effect are less understood. Research has indicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813482179">3</xref></sup> that psychosocial stressors may influence health outcomes via 2 general pathways: through physiological reactions and through behavior change. First, stressors can disrupt important physiological responses (eg, neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular), which may affect health directly by stimulating disease mechanisms or indirectly by causing the body to be less resistant to pathogens and more vulnerable to illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813482179">9</xref></sup> Along these lines, research has supported the link between specific stress-related chemicals (eg, cortisol) and negative health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813482179">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second mechanism by which stressors may affect physical health outcomes is through the alteration of health-related behaviors such as sleep, sedentary activity, diet, and physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813482179">9</xref></sup> Research has established clearly that insufficient and poor sleep is associated with negative health outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813482179">11</xref></sup> as are sedentary behaviors and unhealthy diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813482179">12</xref></sup> Physical activity, on the other hand, provides a number of protective effects against these negative outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813482179">13</xref></sup> Whereas the connection between behaviors and health outcomes is well established, the connection between stressors and health behaviors, especially among children, is less clear. Therefore, it is imperative to determine the effect that stressors have on these behaviors, given the overwhelming evidence for the fact that these behaviors have a very important impact on health outcomes.</p>
<p>Although less of a focus than biological mechanisms, research does suggest links between stressors and key health behaviors among adults. Specifically, stress associated with work or finances has been linked to difficulties in both initiating and maintaining sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813482179">14</xref></sup> Additional research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813482179">15</xref></sup> found that a stressful work environment was associated with a greater tendency for adults to smoke, engage in sedentary behaviors, and consume large quantities of fat. Finally, findings regarding the link between stressors and physical activity in adults have been mixed, though a majority of studies investigating this relationship find that stressors (eg, academic activities or work) are associated with less physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813482179">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813482179">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some evidence suggests a link between stressors and key health behaviors in children; however, this area of research has been quite limited. Currently, the literature indicates that marital conflict and similar family stressors are associated with poor sleep quality in children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813482179">17</xref></sup> whereas interpersonal stressors are linked to a decrease in physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813482179">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813482179">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, research has indicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813482179">18</xref></sup> that perceived stress is associated with greater sedentary behaviors among young girls. Finally, recent studies suggest that perceived stress is also associated with unhealthy eating behaviors, such as increased snacking and intake of fat, decreased intake of fruits and vegetables, and a lower likelihood of consuming breakfast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813482179">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although it is evident that research has begun to document the association between certain pediatric stressors and specific health behaviors, further research is needed to expand on and address the limitations of these studies. First, many of the studies examining the link between stressors and health behaviors in children used a global measure of stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813482179">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813482179">20</xref></sup> Such measures assess the respondent’s perception of overall stress without reference to any specific types of stressors (financial, family, and academic), limiting the interpretability and application of these results. Alternatively, other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813482179">19</xref></sup> measured the effect of a very specific and acute stressor (ie, giving a speech), which limits the generalizability of the findings to more chronic stressors affecting youth populations. Second, financial stressors were generally excluded from all the aforementioned studies, with the exception of those that explicitly measured socioeconomic status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813482179">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813482179">20</xref></sup> Related to this, none of the aforementioned studies examined the link between stressors and health behaviors in children exclusively from low-income families. This is a particularly important population in which to understand this behavioral mechanism, given that children from such backgrounds are especially prone to high levels of stressors, poor health behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813482179">21</xref></sup> and adverse health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813482179">22</xref></sup> Finally, the studies discussed measured perceived stress from only 1 source (ie, the child), raising the possibility of common-method variance problems. Utilizing different reporters (child and parent) for stress and behavior variables would help improve research on this association.</p>
<p>Given the limited number and nature of studies that examine the link between stressors and key health behaviors in children, the purpose of the current study is to gain an increased understanding of an understudied mechanism by building on the foundation of previous research in this area. As such, the current study utilizes both caregiver and child reports of multiple stressors (money, academic, and family), with a particular emphasis on the impact that financial stressors have on children’s key health behaviors. By examining a predominantly low-income pediatric sample, the results from this study may prove important in informing cost-effective health promotion services for children experiencing a number of potential stressors. Specifically, if there is evidence that stressors affect health behaviors, prevention and intervention efforts can focus on modifying health behaviors among children experiencing high levels of stressors. Such interventions would likely improve both the coping strategies and physical health outcomes of children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Thus, the primary hypothesis being tested is that a greater experience of stressors will be associated with poor health behaviors. Specifically, we predicted that more stressors, as reported by both child and caregiver, will be associated with greater sleep problems, more sedentary behavior, and less physical activity.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0009922813482179">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 122 children and their parents/legal guardians were recruited from a large midwestern primary care clinic serving a predominantly low-income population. Eligibility criteria for participation in the study included the following: (1) the child was 8 to 11 years of age; (2) the child was accompanied by his/her parent or legal guardian; (3) both the child and his/her accompanying caregiver spoke and read English; and (4) the child’s parent or primary caregiver provided informed consent. The children had a mean age of 9.48 years (standard deviation = 1.17), with 53.3% of the sample identifying as female. The ethnic composition of the sample was 52.4% Caucasian, 19.0% multiracial, 13.5% African American, 11.9% Hispanic, and 3.2% American Indian. The majority (87.9%) of the caregivers identified as female. A review of child medical records for a subset of the sample (n = 99) showed that 84.8% of the children were on Medicaid, reflecting the low-income status of the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0009922813482179">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were approached by a trained research assistant in the waiting room at the beginning of their visit at a primary care clinic. The research assistant provided information regarding the purpose of the study and obtained parent consent and child assent before beginning the study. The child and participating parent simultaneously and independently completed a series of written questionnaires in the clinic waiting room or an adjacent empty conference room. The research assistant was available to provide any clarification regarding the measures and ensured compliance with the study’s procedures. A total of 201 families were eligible to participate; 128 (63.7%) agreed to participate and complete the measures, and 122 (60.7%) provided sufficient data to be included in the analyses. Children who completed the study were given a small toy, and parents or custodial caregivers were given a monetary compensation of 25 dollars at completion of the study assessments. These procedures were approved by the institutional review board at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln].</p>

<title>Child-reported stressors</title>
<p>Child report of psychosocial stressors (eg, economic, academic, and family) were assessed using a combination of items adapted from published measures for pediatric populations. Items assessing economic stress (eg, “My parents didn’t have enough money to pay the bills” and “We couldn’t afford to buy the kinds of food I like to eat”) and family stress (eg, “Other members of my family had a serious argument” and “Members of my family refused to talk to each other”) were adapted from the Responses to Stress Questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813482179">23</xref></sup> Although this questionnaire includes questions on how the child coped with the given stressor, only frequency ratings of selected stressors were used in this study to maintain the focus on the occurrence of stressors (rather than coping) and limit the length of the child questionnaire. Items focusing on academic stressors (eg, “I got a bad grade on a test” and “I felt like I had too much school work to do”) were adapted from the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813482179">24</xref></sup> and were included to capture a broader range of potentially relevant stressors. The resulting measure consisted of 13 items in which the participants were asked to indicate how often they have experienced a number of different economic (5 items), family (4 items), and school (4 items) stressors in the past 6 months using a 4-point scale (0 = <italic>never</italic> to 3 = <italic>almost every day</italic>). A total stressors score was calculated by summing all of the stressor items and was used as a broad measure of stressors from the child’s perspective. Internal consistency for this measure in the current sample was good (α = .80).</p>

<sec id="section7-0009922813482179">
<title>Parent-reported financial strain</title>
<p>Parental report of perceived financial strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813482179">25</xref></sup> was assessed using 3 items pertaining to economic stress. Using a 4-point scale from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>a lot</italic>), participants were asked to indicate (1) how often they borrowed money from friends or family to help pay bills (in the past 6 months); (2) how often they refrained from buying something that was needed, to make ends meet (in the past 6 months); and (3) how worried they were about their family’s current financial situation. The 3 items were summed to yield a total perceived financial strain score. Internal consistency for this measure in the current sample was good (α = .76).</p>

<title>Selected Health Behaviors</title>
<sec id="section9-0009922813482179">
<title>Sleep problems</title>
<p>Parental report of child sleep problems was assessed using 6 items from the Child Behavior Checklist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813482179">26</xref></sup> regarding issues with sleep quality and quantity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813482179">27</xref></sup> Caregivers indicated how often their children experienced a specific sleep problem (eg, “Sleeps more than other children during the day and/or night”) in the past 6 months using a 3-point Likert scale (0 = <italic>never/not true</italic>; 1 = <italic>sometimes/somewhat true</italic>; 2 = <italic>often/very true</italic>). Items were totaled to yield a total sleep problems score. This scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency in the current sample (α = .75).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922813482179">
<title>Sedentary behavior</title>
<p>Child reports of sedentary behaviors were obtained using a brief measure adapted from the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922813482179">28</xref></sup> Three items assessed the time spent engaging in sedentary behaviors (eg, watching television, playing video games, or being on the computer) in a typical day. Participants indicated the number of hours they spent in the 3 sedentary activities on a 5-point scale (0 = <italic>none</italic>; 1 = <italic>1 hour or less</italic>; 2 = <italic>2 to 3 hours</italic>; 3 = <italic>4 to 5 hours</italic>; and 4 = <italic>6 or more hours</italic>). Items were summed to yield a total sedentary behavior score, which was used as an estimate of time spent across various sedentary behaviors. Although the internal consistency of this measure was low (α = .33), this is not surprising, given that the different behaviors, although all sedentary, are exclusive of each other (eg, a child who is playing video games is not also watching television at that time).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0009922813482179">
<title>Physical activity</title>
<p>Physical activity was assessed using the FELS Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (FELS PAQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813482179">29</xref></sup> The FELS PAQ consists of 3 open-ended questions, used to assess physical activity in the last year in regard to sports, leisure time, and chores, and 5 Likert-scale items, used to further evaluate the extent of physical activity. For each open-ended question (eg, “In the past year, what sports did you play in school?”), participants could list a total of 4 activities, the frequencies of which were assessed using a 3-point scale (1 = <italic>sometimes</italic>; 2 = <italic>often</italic>; 3 = <italic>regularly</italic>). For the remaining 5 items, participants indicated how often they engaged in the specified behavior (eg, “How often do you walk or bicycle per day to or from school?”) using a 5-point scale from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very often</italic>). The intensity of the activities indicated by participants were ranked as low, moderate, or high using MET (metabolic equivalent) values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922813482179">30</xref></sup> The FELS PAQ yields a total physical activity score. Previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813482179">29</xref></sup> reported low but significant correlation coefficients between the FELS PAQ and actigraph data (<italic>r</italic> = 0.29 to 0.36).</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p><italic>t</italic> Tests were conducted to determine whether there were any gender or age differences in the study variables. A series of stepwise linear regression analyses were performed with both child-reported psychosocial stressors and parent-reported financial strain predicting child sleep problems, sedentary behaviors, or physical activity (each analyzed in separate regression models). In each regression analysis, demographic variables (ie, age and gender) were entered on the first step to control for any gender and/or age effects. Child-reported psychosocial stressors and parent-reported financial strain were then entered on the second step, and the unique variance contributed by these predictors was analyzed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Consistent with our research hypotheses, the current study found that both child-reported stressors and parent-reported financial strain significantly and uniquely predicted child health behaviors. Specifically, higher levels of stressors in general were associated with more sleep problems and sedentary behaviors, even after controlling for gender and age. Moreover, both parental financial strain and a more diverse set of child-reported stressors were unique, independent predictors of sleep problems and sedentary behaviors. Also consistent with our expectations, stressors in general were significantly related to child physical activity; however, the specific relationships of parental financial strain and child-reported stressors with physical activity indicate that these relationships are complex. These findings are consistent with the literature regarding psychosocial stress and physical activity in adult populations, in which mixed findings have emerged in regard to this relationship (see Limitations section for further discussion of measurement issues).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813482179">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813482179">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>To fully understand the relationship between stressors and health behaviors, it is important to consider how psychosocial stressors, especially those that are financial in nature, may affect children’s health behaviors. Overall, it is likely that stressors have an adverse affect on child health behaviors by increasing worry and interfering with daily routines. For example, sleep may be negatively affected because children ruminate over stressors and have difficulty falling and/or staying asleep. Moreover, chaotic and stressful family environments may interrupt daily routines, making the establishment of regular and healthy sleep patterns more challenging. Relatedly, sedentary behaviors (eg, video games, computer, and television) may be encouraged by parents who find themselves stressed and/or have limited resources for other activities. Children may also engage in sedentary behaviors in an effort to occupy their time and escape from stressors.</p>
<p>As noted, the relationship between stressors and physical activity appears to be complex because child worries were associated with less physical activity, but parental financial strain was associated with more child physical activity. The relationship between child worries and physical activity was expected, given the relationship between child worries and sedentary behaviors; children appear to use electronic means to cope with stressors. However, the relationship between parental financial strain and child physical activity is less clear. It is possible that parents who experience financial strain are more likely to work late and, thus, place their children in after-school programs (eg, sporting activities). Alternatively, parents with limited resources may encourage their children to go outdoors and play independently because they are too overwhelmed to provide structure and activity within the home or spend much time with their children themselves.</p>
<p>Though the complex relationship between stressors and physical activity has been illustrated in existing literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813482179">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813482179">16</xref></sup> there is also evidence that data regarding physical activity may not be as informative as data on sedentary behavior. For instance, the presence of sedentary behaviors appears to be more important for health outcomes than the presence or absence of physical activity as research with adults indicates that those who spend more time engaging in sedentary behaviors but still engage in physical activity are at a similar risk for obesity compared with those who engage in sedentary behaviors but do not get enough physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922813482179">31</xref></sup> Moreover, sedentary behavior has a direct influence on a number of health outcomes (eg, metabolism and cardiovascular health) and is associated (often independent of physical activity levels) with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and various forms of cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922813482179">32</xref></sup> Together, the findings from the current and past research indicate that physical activity and sedentary behaviors are not simply opposite constructs, and as such, intervention programs should target them differently. In turn, promotion and intervention efforts may be more successful if they focus on diminishing sedentary behaviors rather than focusing solely on increasing physical activity.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings of the current study are important in (1) furthering our understanding of a relatively understudied behavioral mechanism implicated in the link between stressors and physical health outcomes and (2) identifying a number of clinically relevant issues that can inform health interventions. Specifically, this study replicates existing findings and further elucidates the relationship between stress and health outcomes by providing evidence that stress is associated with poor health behaviors (ie, sleep problems and greater sedentary behaviors) in a low-income pediatric sample. Research has clearly established that such health behaviors are linked to adverse chronic health issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813482179">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813482179">12</xref></sup> Therefore, knowledge of the role that health behaviors have in the relationship between stress and health outcomes is especially important because it provides us with easily targeted points of intervention (ie, health behaviors).</p>
<p>The current study expands on previous research by addressing some key limitations. First, it used both global (ie, child-reported worries) and specific (ie, parent-reported financial strain) measures of psychosocial stressors. Given that both global and specific stressors were associated with key health behaviors in children, the interpretability and generalizability of the current study’s findings is strengthened. Moreover, because the current study used both child- and parent-report measures of psychosocial stressors, we have greater confidence that the findings are not simply a result of common-method variance but, instead, that there is a meaningful association between stressors and key health behaviors in children.</p>
<p>The results of the present study also extend previous research by indicating that financial stressors specifically are associated with adverse health behaviors in a low-income pediatric population. Given that both low-income children and their parents experience high rates of stressors (especially financial stressors), it is not surprising that research indicates a high prevalence of health behavior problems among children from low-income backgrounds, including sedentary behaviors, unhealthy food choices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813482179">21</xref></sup> and sleep problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922813482179">33</xref></sup> As such, it is especially salient that we understand the relationships among stressors, health behaviors, and health outcomes in low-income children to best tailor health interventions to this at-risk population.</p>
<sec id="section17-0009922813482179">
<title>Implications for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics</title>
<p>The results of this study have important implications for targeted pediatric health promotion efforts. As previously noted, negative changes in health-related behaviors may contribute to adverse physical health outcomes (eg, obesity, diabetes, and cancer). Given that behaviors are more modifiable than biological responses, the findings of the current study may be particularly useful in informing and focusing health promotion and intervention efforts for children with a number of stressors (eg, low-income populations). Strong, evidence-based behavioral treatments are available to address both sedentary behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813482179">4</xref></sup> and pediatric sleep problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922813482179">34</xref></sup> Not only could such interventions potentially ameliorate some of the negative health consequences of stress, but they may also be particularly cost-effective strategies, given the long-term costs of chronic health problems. Moreover, the results of this study inform identification efforts of children at risk for engaging in unhealthy behaviors by pediatricians. Specifically, pediatricians could play an important role in screening for stressors, promoting healthy behaviors, and/or making target referrals for more intensive health behavior interventions.</p>
<p>Based on the assumptions of the ecological systems theory, prevention and intervention efforts would likely be most effective if focused on both the child and the broader social context. Therefore, both prevention and intervention efforts should be targeted across multiple levels, including children, caregivers, schools, and public policies. Identification of children at high risk could be achieved through stressor screenings at schools or primary care facilities. High-risk children could then participate in behavioral interventions that target key health behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813482179">4</xref></sup> and promote more adaptive and active coping strategies. Teaching adaptive coping skills is particularly important in low-income pediatric populations for 2 important reasons: (1) financial stressors may not be easily ameliorated because of their chronic nature and (2) childhood is an opportune time for changing behaviors before they become habitual. Further intervention efforts should focus on low-income caregivers by teaching parents ways to promote healthier behaviors in their children, especially in situations of high stress. Moreover, systems such as schools serving financially stressed populations are particularly important to target health behavior promotion efforts, given the large number of children such programs would reach. Overall, efforts should be made at all levels to reduce the effect of stressors, especially financial ones, on health behaviors, given the important impact such behaviors have on health outcomes.</p>

<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Although this study adds to the existing literature and suggests areas for clinical intervention, some limitations should be noted. First, the cross-sectional nature of this investigation prevents us from inferring directionality between stressors and health-related behaviors. As such, future studies should use longitudinal methods better suited to investigate causal relationships and potential mediators of the stressor–health behavior relationship. Second, the current study did not examine the entire stress–health behaviors–health outcomes pathway but rather only the link between stressors and health behaviors. Although the link between health behaviors and outcomes is well established, future research could examine stressors, health behaviors, and key health outcomes in more comprehensive models to further explicate this pathway and inform intervention.</p>
<p>Third, the limited availability of brief and well-validated measures assessing multiple domains of stressors in this age range required us to adapt existing measures for this study. Despite these adaptations, the resulting measures demonstrated good reliability and provided reasonable estimates of stressor-related constructs. In a related issue, the adapted measures certainly did not cover all possible child stressors but instead provided a sampling of common stressors across various domains (ie, family, academic, and financial). We believe that this broad sampling is an important addition to previous studies, which often focused on a single type of stressor; however, future research can build on our study by expanding the number and types of stressors assessed. Another limitation of the present investigation was the accuracy of the child-report measures, specifically those in which children were required to report on their health behaviors (eg, physical activity). Retrospective reports of physical activity by children can be especially plagued by poor recollection and reporter bias, limiting the quality of resulting data. As such, the complex findings in regard to physical activity in the current study may be partly a result of the limited utility of child-report PAQs. The limitations of self-reports highlight the potential value of using objective measures of physical activity (eg, pedometers and accelerometers) and other health behaviors such as sleep (eg, actigraphs) in future research.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Key health behaviors (eg, sleep and sedentary behavior) have been consistently linked to physical health outcomes. This study increases our understanding of the understudied behavioral mechanism implicated in the pathway between stressors and overall health in a low-income pediatric population. Specifically, results indicated that stressors, both in general and specific stressors, are associated with adverse health behaviors (ie, sleep problems and sedentary behavior). Results, therefore, have important clinical implications by indicating target areas for health promotion, at-risk identification, and intervention efforts. Additional longitudinal research is needed to further explore the full relationship among stressors, health behaviors, and health outcomes.</p>

<abstract>
<p>An analytical model is presented for the ballistic impact behavior of ceramic-composite armors. The model is based on wave theory and energy balance between the kinetic energy of the projectile and the energy absorbed by different mechanisms. The armor analyzed consists of front composite cover layer, ceramic plate, rubber layer and the composite backing plate. The projectile is cylindrical. The major damage and energy-absorbing mechanisms are compression of the target directly below the projectile, compression in the surrounding region around the point of impact, formation of ring cracks and radial cracks in the ceramic leading to tensile failure, shear plugging, pulverization of the ceramic, tension in the yarns, delamination and matrix cracking in the composite, bulge formation on the back face of the composite backing plate and friction between the target and the projectile. Projectile erosion and deformation are also considered. Kinetic energy, velocity and deceleration of the projectile, distance traveled by the projectile and the contact force are presented as a function of time. Ballistic limit velocity, contact duration and damage progression are also given. Further, solution procedure is presented for the study of ballistic impact behavior of ceramic-composite armors. Analytical predictions are validated with the experimental results. Finally, performance of a typical ceramic-composite armor is presented.</p>

<p>Armors are designed to enhance personnel and vehicle survivability by defeating projectiles and fragments. It absorbs the kinetic energy of the projectile hitting the armor surface by different mechanisms. Traditionally, armors were made monolithic, usually of high hardness steel. Weapon designers are constantly improving the terminal effects of their projectiles. To overcome this, armors are becoming thicker and heavier. The increased weight of the armors reduces the mobility of its user. Hence, armor materials research strives to find solutions for the major problems associated with armors such as penetrability, weight and cost. Worldwide researchers have been trying different materials and their combinations for the development of improved armor systems.</p>
<p>Armor penetration by projectiles is influenced by variables such as material properties, projectile mass and incident impact velocity, projectile shape and size, target support condition and relative dimensions of the target and the projectile. Different deformation mechanisms contributing to penetration may act at different stages of the process. Knowledge of failure conditions is useful in designing a target with minimum areal density to defeat a projectile. To meet these design objectives, it is necessary to identify the important material properties and how they relate to the failure mechanisms during the penetration and perforation process.</p>
<p>Ceramics are attractive as armor materials because they are more weight-efficient than traditional monolithic armors against a variety of threats. This is primarily because of low density, high hardness, high compressive strength and high elastic modulus of ceramics. However, the low tensile strength typical of ceramics severely limits their performance, and thus standalone ceramic armors can be inferior to traditional steel armors.</p>
<p>By supporting the ceramic facing with a back-up plate, the performance of the armors can be dramatically increased. Introduction of rubber layer in between ceramic and back-up plate improves the multi-hit capabilities of the armors. A front composite cover layer protects from small damages and heat and also prevents crack growth in the ceramic plate.</p>
<p>The application of ceramic-composite multilayered armors is growing rapidly as the need for lighter and more agile combat vehicles increases. Armor performance strongly depends upon the threat conditions and the armor design and configuration. It is important to understand the energy dissipation and the damage mechanisms of such armor systems for understanding their behavior under ballistic impact.</p>
<p>Available experimental studies in the literature are specific to certain types of materials under certain ballistic impact conditions. Based on these experimental studies, the ballistic impact behavior of ceramic-composite armors cannot be fully understood. For complete understanding of this phenomenon, analytical studies are needed. Very few analytical studies are available in literature. The available analytical models are not complete and they do not take into account all the energy absorbing and damage mechanisms.</p>
<p>In the present study, an analytical model is presented for the prediction of ballistic impact behavior of ceramic-composite armors with a rubber layer in between ceramic and composite backing plate and a front composite cover layer. The formulation is presented for a cylindrical projectile. The analytical model is based on wave theory and energy balance between the kinetic energy of the projectile and the energy absorbed by different mechanisms. Energy absorbed by different mechanisms at different time intervals, velocity of the projectile, displacement and deceleration of the projectile, contact force and damage progression can be evaluated. Erosion and deformation of the projectile are also incorporated in the model. Further, using the analytical model, ballistic limit velocity can be determined.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1056789511435346"><title>Summary of earlier studies</title>
<p>Some of the earlier studies on ballistic impact performances of armors are presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789511435346">Florence (1969)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056789511435346">Lee and Tupper (1954)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789511435346">Recht (1978)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056789511435346">Tate (1967)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056789511435346">Taylor (1948)</xref>. The very first significant analytical work was carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056789511435346">Tate (1967)</xref> on penetration process using hydrodynamic theory. He presented a modified form of hydrodynamic theory incorporating strength effect and presented a method for estimating the deceleration of the projectile and depth of penetration. His studies were on metal targets. The estimates were compared with experimental results and a good agreement was found.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789511435346">Florence (1969)</xref> proposed an analytical model in which the projectile was idealized as a short cylindrical rod. A normal impact of the projectile on to the ceramic-metal plate was considered. It was argued that when the projectile strikes the hard ceramic facing, the tip shatters. Then the ceramic progressively breaks into a cone of fractured material, which subsequently spreads the impact load over a wider area of backing metallic plate. As the projectile penetrates the broken ceramic, the ductile back plate deforms and absorbs the kinetic energy of impact. He predicted ballistic limit velocity considering the energy balance between the projectile and the target. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789511435346">Recht (1978)</xref> presented the application of concept presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056789511435346">Taylor (1948)</xref> to predict projectile deformation, projectile mass loss and plate deformation. Mass loss model for projectile included both erosion and deformation mechanisms. Erosion and deformation are governed by the plastic wave velocity in the projectile.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789511435346">Woodward (1990)</xref> proposed a set of equations governing the main physical mechanisms taking part during the penetration process. He developed a one-dimensional model for the penetration into ceramic-faced armor using a lumped mass scheme. This model takes into account both the projectile and the ceramic erosion in a fairly simple manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789511435346">Chocron-Benloulo and Sachez-Galvez (1998)</xref> presented a one-dimensional analytical model for ceramic-metal target and checked against experimental data and numerical simulations.</p>

The model is based on work presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056789511435346">Tate (1967)</xref> for projectile penetration into ceramic and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789511435346">Woodward (1990)</xref> for the behavior of metal backing plate.

He developed analytical equations for predicting the penetration and perforation for different shapes of projectiles. The models are based on the assumption that deformations during a ballistic impact event are localized and the mean pressure from the laminate to resist the projectile consists of both quasi-static resistive pressure due to elastic-plastic deformation and dynamic resistive pressure due to velocity effects. The predictions are based on elastic limit, density of the target and geometry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056789511435346">Zhang et al. (2002)</xref> presented a dynamic model of ballistic impact against ceramic/hybrid composite.

The model was based on work presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789511435346">Florence (1969)</xref> and low velocity impact.

<p>Even though there are typical studies on ballistic impact behavior of ceramic-metal, metal and ceramic targets, it can be seen that there are very few studies on the ballistic impact performance of ceramic-composite armors. Ceramic and composite combination has clear advantages as an armor material compared with the other armor materials. For the effective use of ceramic-composite armors, damage and energy-absorbing mechanisms should be clearly understood. For such a need, analytical studies are more useful. In this study, an analytical model is presented for the ballistic impact analysis of ceramic–polymer matrix composite armors. The model is based on our earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056789511435346">Naik and Doshi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056789511435346">Naik et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>A typical ceramic-composite armor is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789511435346">Figure 1</xref>. The main structural components are ceramic and composite backing plate. The rubber layer in between ceramic and composite as well as the front composite cover layer also act as structural elements.
<fig id="fig1-1056789511435346" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Cross-section of a typical ceramic-composite armor.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789511435346-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The major energy absorption is provided by the ceramic. In an ideal situation, the damage should not spread to the composite backing plate. This is because the composite plate should be able to provide the structural requirements and act as a load carrying element during post impact period even after damages have taken place in ceramic. The composite plate can also absorb energy. In such cases, it can be damaged. The rubber layer in between the ceramic and the composite delays the penetration process, Also it prevents merging of damages within the ceramic and the composite. The front composite cover layer prevents the ceramic from micro damages.</p>

</list></p>
<p>At higher incident impact velocities, erosion of the tip of the projectile would take place. As the velocity of the projectile decreases, deformation of the projectile would take place. Erosion and deformation of the projectile would absorb some energy during ballistic impact event. This would lead to reduction in velocity and kinetic energy of the projectile.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2a-1056789511435346">Figures 2(a) to (c)</xref> show different damage and energy absorption mechanisms in ceramic-composite armors during ballistic impact event. The figures show a cylindrical projectile. When the projectile strikes the target, the target would offer resistance for the penetration of the projectile into the target. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2a-1056789511435346">Figure 2(a)</xref>, the material directly below the projectile is called region 1. The surrounding material offering the resistance for penetration is called region 2. As the projectile strikes the target, longitudinal and shear stress waves are generated and travel along all the directions. Only that part of the target up to which these waves have reached would offer the resistance for penetration. The remaining portion of the target does not sense the applied impact load. As the time progresses, the stress wave would propagate further and larger part of the target would offer resistance.

</p>
<p>As the projectile strikes the target, the material directly below the projectile would be under compression. The material in the surrounding region is also under compression along thickness direction. If the induced compressive stress exceeds the permissible limit, compressive failure of ceramic would take place. The induced compressive stress is calculated based on the deformation in ceramic and the distance up to which through the thickness longitudinal stress wave has traveled. Additionally, because of the impact force generated, shear stresses are also generated within the target around the periphery of the projectile. The resistance for the shear failure would be offered only by that part of the target up to which the shear wave has reached.</p>
<p>As the compression of the ceramic takes place during the ballistic impact event directly below the target, the ceramic along radial direction would be under tension. This can lead to the formation of ring cracks and radial cracks.</p>
<p>As the projectile strikes the ceramic, micro cracks would be formed in the ceramic. As the ballistic impact event progresses, the micro cracks could become macro cracks. During this phase additional micro cracks would be formed. In other words, the ceramic would be broken into granules and later into powder. The compressive strength of the ceramic powder is significantly higher than that of the ceramic plate. This indicates that as the penetration progresses, the compressive resistance offered by the ceramic/ceramic powder would increase. The process of formation of fine powdery particles from the ceramic plate is called pulverization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789511435346">Gailly and Espinosa, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Different damage mechanisms such as compression, shear plugging, tension and pulverization would lead to energy absorption. As the energy is absorbed by the target, the kinetic energy of the projectile would decrease accordingly. This would lead to reduction in velocity of the projectile.</p>
<p>As the projectile strikes the target, resistance would be offered by the target for penetration of the projectile onto the target. If the resistance offered by the target is more, erosion of the projectile could take place. This process also would absorb some kinetic energy of the projectile leading to reduction in the velocity of the projectile. As the velocity decreases, erosion would stop and deformation of the projectile would take place.</p>
<p>As the ballistic impact event progresses, through the thickness, normal and shear stress waves would enter into rubber layer and composite backing plate. With this the composite backing plate as well as the rubber layer would also offer resistance to penetration and perforation. The energy-absorbing mechanisms in the rubber layer are compression and shear plugging. As the through-the-thickness longitudinal stress wave enters into the composite, compression would take place in region 1 as well as in region 2 of the composite. Because of the impact force, shear stresses are generated in the composite around the periphery of the projectile. The yarns under the projectile would be in tension. If the induced compressive stress, shear stress or tensile stress exceeds the permissible limit, failure of composite would take place. Delamination, matrix cracking and bulge formation on the back face of the composite leading to possible tensile failure of the yarns are the other damage and energy-absorbing mechanisms. During the later part of the ballistic impact event, the velocity of the projectile is very low. During this period, frictional energy would be absorbed by the target. All these damage and energy-absorbing mechanisms would absorb some energy leading to further decrease in the kinetic energy of the projectile. This would lead to further decrease in the velocity of the projectile.</p>

<p>The primary objective of the armor is to arrest the projectile from penetration and perforation. Based on the structural and other requirements, the projectile can be arrested at different locations of the armor. One of the typical cases is when the tip of the projectile just reaches to the back face of the composite backing plate with zero velocity. The incident impact velocity that leads to the tip of the projectile reaching to the back face of the composite backing plate with zero velocity is defined as the ballistic limit velocity.</p>

<p>The damage and energy-absorbing mechanisms presented in the earlier section are considered in the analytical model. Energy absorption by the projectile and the target are presented separately. The analysis is presented for the armor consisting of front composite cover layer, ceramic plate, rubber layer and composite backing plate and a cylindrical projectile. The formulation presented is based on the following assumptions:

<list-item><p>The projectile is cylindrical with a flat end.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The projectile is made up of a single material.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The thickness of the armor is significantly less than the length and width of the armor. Hence armor edge effects are not considered.</p></list-item>

<p>When the impact velocity of the projectile is less than or equal to the plastic wave velocity in the projectile, erosion of the projectile would not take place. Instead, deformation of the front end of the projectile would take place. As a result of deformation, mushrooming of the front end of the projectile would take place and the diameter of the projectile would increase rapidly at the front end of the projectile. If the diameter exceeds 1.25 times the original diameter of the projectile, mass loss due to shearing of the material would take place as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1056789511435346">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789511435346">Recht, 1978</xref>).

<p>The maximum compressive strain in the ceramic plate is at a section where the tip of the projectile is in contact with the ceramic plate. The minimum compressive strain in the ceramic plate is at a section up to which the compressive stress wave has reached. This is because the area of the ceramic plate resisting the compressive load is more at a section up to which the through the thickness compressive wave has reached.

<p>When a projectile impacts on to a ceramic target, a pulverized zone is formed ahead of the projectile tip due to intense stress conditions. Pulverization of the ceramic into fine powdery form would take place. The fine powder formed would start ejecting outward from the ceramic surface through the annular area between the projectile and the ceramic formed during penetration of the projectile. The ceramic powder just below the projectile tip would be compacted. The density of this ceramic powder would be higher than the density of bulk ceramic by a factor <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub>. The density of the ceramic powder ejecting out would be lower than the density of bulk ceramic by a factor <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub>. The path available for the ejection of the ceramic powder is the gap between the sheared ceramic plate and the projectile. The ceramic powder ejected outward by certain velocity would have some kinetic energy.</p>

<sec id="sec28-1056789511435346"><title>Different stages during ballistic impact event</title>
<p>The ballistic impact event as described in the analytical model can be sub-divided into four stages:
<list id="list34-1056789511435346" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage 1 represents up to the time interval when through-the-thickness longitudinal compressive wave has reached to the back face of the ceramic plate. At this stage, the rubber layer and composite backing plate have not experienced the impact loading and would not offer resistance to penetration of the projectile. Even though through-the-thickness shear wave has started propagating, it has not reached to the back face of the ceramic plate. Possible damage and energy-absorbing mechanisms are compression of ceramic plate along thickness direction in region 1 as well as in region 2, tensile radial and transverse cracking in ceramic, shear plugging of ceramic, compression of ceramic in radial direction, pulverization and heat generation. Shear plugging of front composite cover layer and erosion and deformation of the projectile are the other possible energy-absorbing mechanisms.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 2 represents the time interval when through-the-thickness shear wave has reached to the back face of the composite backing plate. At this stage, the shear crack front has reached to the back face of the composite backing plate. The projectile tip would be well within the composite backing plate/ceramic. The shear plug formed within the composite would not have exited the back face of the composite backing plate. Possible additional damage and energy absorption mechanisms during this stage are compression of composite backing plate along thickness direction in region 1 as well as in region 2, tension in the yarns in the composite backing plate, shear plugging of composite backing plate and delamination and matrix cracking. Shear plugging and compression of rubber layer are the other possible energy-absorbing mechanisms.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 3 represents the time interval when the tip of the projectile has reached to the back face of the composite backing plate. At this stage, the velocity of the projectile is practically zero, and it has not exited from the composite backing plate. But the composite and ceramic plugs have exited from the back face of the composite backing plate. The composite plug could be in pieces, whereas the ceramic plug would be in powdery form. During this stage, the kinetic energy of the projectile would be very less. Since the shear crack front has already reached to the back face of the composite backing plate during stage 2, additional energy absorbing mechanism during stage 3 would be only frictional resistance offered by the composite to the projectile.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The incident ballistic impact velocity that leads to the tip of the projectile reaching to the back face of the composite backing plate with zero velocity is defined as the ballistic limit velocity.
<list id="list35-1056789511435346" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage 4 represents the exit of the projectile from the back face of the composite backing plate. If the incident ballistic impact velocity is more than the ballistic limit velocity, the projectile would be exiting the target with certain residual velocity.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<p>Analytical prediction of residual velocity and ballistic limit velocity are also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1056789511435346">Table 4</xref>.

<p>The studies are carried out with alumina 99.9% as ceramic plate and geometry of the projectile and armor as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056789511435346">Table 1</xref>. The energy absorbed by different energy-absorbing mechanisms, kinetic energy of the projectile, projectile and projectile–ceramic interface velocity, contact force and distance traveled by projectile tip during ballistic impact event are evaluated as a function of time.</p>
<sec id="sec33-1056789511435346"><title>Case I</title>
<p>Studies were carried out with incident ballistic impact velocity of 1096 m/s. In this case, complete perforation of the target by the projectile took place, that is, the projectile tip just reached to the back face of the composite backing plate with zero velocity. Hence, the incident ballistic impact velocity of 1096 m/s is the ballistic limit velocity. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1056789511435346">Figures 6(a)</xref> to 9 and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1056789511435346">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1056789511435346">6</xref>. The projectile kinetic energy decreases during the ballistic impact event. This is because the energy is absorbed by the target and the projectile by different mechanisms.

<p>The major energy-absorbing mechanisms are erosion of projectile, shear plugging of ceramic and tensile failure of composite backing plate yarns. Shear plugging of composite backing plate also absorbs some energy. Energy absorbed by the other mechanisms is very less. Percentage of energy absorbed by different mechanisms is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1056789511435346">Table 5</xref>.</p>
<p>Ballistic impact parameters such as contact duration, contact force, projectile displacement and residual velocity are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1056789511435346">Table 6</xref>. Total contact duration is 522.14 ms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1056789511435346">Table 6</xref>). But projectile velocity is nearly equal to zero at 15.99 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1056789511435346">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1056789511435346">Table 6</xref>). This time interval indicates that the through-the-thickness transverse (shear) wave has reached to the back face of the composite backing plate. The decrease in projectile velocity is very rapid initially. This is because of higher energy absorbed by projectile erosion and shear plugging of ceramic. As the velocity of the projectile decreases below the plastic wave velocity in the projectile, further erosion of the projectile would stop and deformation of the projectile would start.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789511435346">Figure 7</xref> shows projectile velocity and projectile–ceramic interface velocity. As long as erosion of the projectile is taking place, the projectile velocity would be more than the projectile–ceramic interface velocity. But the projectile velocity would be approaching to the projectile–ceramic interface velocity during the erosion process. Point a in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789511435346">Figure 7</xref> indicates the end of erosion of the projectile and beginning of projectile deformation. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789511435346">Figure 7</xref>, it can be seen that projectile–ceramic interface velocity and projectile velocity are nearly the same during erosion process. During the projectile deformation process, projectile–ceramic interface velocity would remain constant. But the interface velocity is significantly lower than the projectile velocity. As the through-the-thickness compressive wave crosses the back face of the ceramic, deformation of the projectile would stop. This is indicted by point b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789511435346">Figure 7</xref>. After this, the projectile and projectile–ceramic interface velocities would be the same. In other words, the projectile and the ceramic would be moving forward together.

Point a indicates that the through-the-thickness compressive wave has reached to the back face of the ceramic whereas point b indicates that the through-the-thickness transverse wave has reached to the back face of the ceramic. Point c indicates that the through-the-thickness transverse wave has reached to the back face of the composite backing plate. Point d indicates that the erosion of the projectile has stopped, whereas Point e indicates that the through-the-thickness transverse wave has entered the composite backing plate. Points a, b and c represent the critical time intervals where the contact force could be maximum. In this case, point b represents peak contact force.

<p>Studies were also carried out with incident ballistic impact velocity of 1046 m/s. This is lower than the ballistic limit velocity. In this case, the total kinetic energy of the projectile would be less than the total energy that can be absorbed by the target and the projectile. The projectile would not be exiting the armor.

<p>Studies were also carried out with incident ballistic impact velocity of 1146 m/s. This is higher than the ballistic limit velocity. In this case, the total kinetic energy of the projectile would be more than the total energy that can be absorbed by the target and the projectile.

The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1056789511435346">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1056789511435346">6</xref>.

<p>Comparing case I, case II and case III, it can be seen that the energy absorbed by projectile erosion increases as the incident ballistic impact velocity is increased. The energy absorbed by shear plugging of ceramic decreases as the incident ballistic impact velocity is increased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1056789511435346">Table 5</xref>). Further, the peak contact force decreases as the incident ballistic impact velocity is increased.

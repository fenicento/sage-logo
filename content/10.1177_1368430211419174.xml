<abstract>
<p>This paper reports an experiment that demonstrates the superiority of groups over the best individuals using various instructions for strategies to solve letters-to-numbers problems. Simulations provide baseline statistics to compare performances. Letters-to-numbers problems require identification of the random coding of the ten letters <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, <italic>F</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, <italic>J</italic> to the ten numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 by (a) proposing an expression in letters ( <italic>A</italic> + <italic>B</italic> ); (b) receiving the value of the expression in letters ( <italic>A</italic> + <italic>B</italic> = <italic>DG</italic>); (c) proposing codings of the numbers for the letters; and (d) receiving feedback on the correctness of the proposed codings, on each trial. Three-person groups and individuals solved the problems under five instruction conditions to use different strategies. As predicted, the groups generally had fewer trials to solution than the best of an equivalent number of individuals, and the best performance was achieved with the most information-rich instruction, to add all ten letters.</p>

<p>The scientific method is a process of observation of phenomena, hypothesis formation to provisionally explain the phenomena, hypothesis testing by controlled experiments, learning the outcome (further evidence), and reasoning to formulate a theoretical explanation. Scientific research is increasingly conducted by research teams rather than individual scientists. Do these scientific research teams perform better than individual scientists working alone?</p>
<p>A series of three experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211419174">Laughlin, Bonner, &amp; Miner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211419174">Laughlin, Hatch, Silver, &amp; Boh 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211419174">Laughlin, Zander, Knievel, &amp; Tan, 2003</xref>) found that each of three-person, four- person, and five-person groups performed better than the best of an equivalent number of individuals (e.g., 40 five-person groups performed better than the best 40 of 40 x 5 = 200 individuals) on letters-to-numbers problems. In these problems, the ten letters <italic>A</italic> through <italic>J</italic> were randomly assigned (without replacement) to the ten numbers 0 through 9. The objective was to identify the correct coding by a series of trials in which the group or individual (a) proposed an expression in letters (<italic>A</italic> + <italic>B</italic>); (b) were told the answer in letters (<italic>A</italic> + <italic>B</italic> = <italic>DG</italic>); (c) proposed a single hypothesis (<italic>D</italic> = 1); (d) were told whether the hypothesis was correct or incorrect (Yes, <italic>D</italic> = 1); (e) proposed the full coding of letters to numbers when they believed they had solved the problem. The full correct coding solved the problem, whereas less than the full correct coding required a further trial.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211419174">Laughlin, Carey, and Kerr (2008)</xref> later developed a computer-administered version of letters-to-numbers problems. This allows one experimenter to conduct many simultaneous experiments in a computer lab, allows more successive problems in a given experimental session because the computer was faster, eliminates human error in calculating values and recording data, and automatically records all input data and times. This version was used for this study. In this version, the problem solvers propose a coding for as many of the ten numbers as they desired on each trial.</p>
<p>Letters-to-numbers problems model the scientific method by the process of proposing an expression in letters (experiment), learning the value of the expression (outcome), coding the numbers to letters (hypothesis testing), learning the results (correct or incorrect codings), and reasoning from the set of expressions and values (evidence) to an explanation of the full coding of the ten letters to the ten numbers.</p>
<p>Letters-to-numbers problems are highly intellective and strongly fulfill the four conditions of demonstrability of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211419174">Laughlin and Ellis (1986)</xref>. The group members began the problem with agreement on the conceptual systems of the natural numbers and elementary arithmetic, algebra, and logic (Condition 1). There was sufficient information for problem solution (Condition 2). The group members who did not themselves propose informative expressions or effective reasoning were able to recognize and accept them when proposed by the other group members (Condition 3). The members who proposed informative expressions and effective reasoning had sufficient ability, motivation, and time to demonstrate them to the other members (Condition 4). Letters-to-numbers problems are a complementary group task on which groups exhibit strong process gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211419174">Steiner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211419174">Steiner &amp; Rajaratnam, 1961</xref>). Moreover, letters-to-numbers problems are interesting and highly motivating for intelligent problem solvers such as college students, precluding motivational losses due to faulty group processes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211419174">Baron &amp; Kerr, 2002</xref>, for a review of motivational process losses in groups).</p>
<p>Given these four conditions of demonstrability, the group members were able to combine their effective problem-solving processes to perform better than the best individuals solving the problems alone. In the terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211419174">Steiner (1972)</xref> and Steiner and Rajaratnam (1966), letters-to-numbers problems are a complementary group task on which the groups had process gains that enabled them to perform better than the best individuals. With the random assignment to group and individual conditions, this equivalently means that the groups performed better than their best members.</p>
<p>Letters-to-numbers problems may be solved by many different strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211419174">Laughlin et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211419174">2003</xref>). These strategies may be considered as analogs of different experimental procedures addressing the same problem by the scientific method. The purpose of this study was to further extend the comparison of groups and the best of an equivalent number of individuals under five instructions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211419174">Figure 1</xref>) to use different strategies. Instructed to use a strategy, do groups use it more effectively than the best of an equivalent number of individuals?</p>

<title>Pure guessing</title>
<p>The most simple strategy is to enter any expression, ignore the resulting value, and guess a new nonredundant number to each of the remaining unidentified letters on each trial. This strategy is not very effective (and no human solver actually used it), but the simulation of it serves as a baseline.</p>

<title>Two-letter repetition strategy</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1368430211419174">Figure 2</xref> gives two illustrations of a two-letter repetition strategy. The strategy begins with an expression that repeats a letter, say <italic>A</italic> + <italic>A</italic>, on Trial 1, makes all appropriate inferences from the value of the expression, guesses an assignment of numbers to letters accordingly, and guesses the remaining letters. The expression on Trial 2 uses a new letter that was not involved in the expression or value on Trial 1 and feedback indicated was not 0, and follows the same procedures. Similarly, the expressions on Trial 3 and following use a new letter that was not involved in the previous expressions and values.</p>

</fig>
<p>As an illustration of the reasoning, in the top example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1368430211419174">Figure 2</xref> Expression 1 is <italic>A</italic> + <italic>A</italic>. The value <italic>DH</italic> indicates that D is 1 (note that <italic>DH</italic> represents a two-digit number, not <italic>D</italic> times <italic>H</italic>). To generate the two-digit value <italic>DH</italic>, <italic>A</italic> must be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, with <italic>H</italic> correspondingly 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Accordingly, the number 1 is assigned to letter <italic>D</italic> and one of the possible pairs for <italic>A</italic> and <italic>H</italic> is chosen, here assigning 8 to the letter <italic>A</italic> and 6 to the letter <italic>H</italic>. The remaining seven letters are guessed. The feedback indicates that <italic>D</italic> is correct (by logic), and <italic>I</italic> is 7 (by a correct guess). The columns of the letters <italic>D</italic> and <italic>I</italic> highlight on the computer screen to indicate correct letters.</p>

<title>Three-letter repetition strategy</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1368430211419174">Figure 3</xref> presents two illustrations of a three- letter repetition strategy. The strategy begins with an expression that repeats a letter three times, say <italic>A</italic> + <italic>A</italic> + <italic>A</italic>, makes all appropriate inferences from the value of the expressions, assigns numbers to letters accordingly, and guesses the remaining letters. Subsequent expressions use a new letter that was not involved in the expression or value on any previous trial, known not to be 0, and follow the same procedures. As an illustration of the reasoning, in the top example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1368430211419174">Figure 3</xref> the value <italic>DI</italic> for Expression 1, <italic>A</italic> + <italic>A</italic> + <italic>A</italic>, in the top illustration of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1368430211419174">Figure 3</xref> indicates that <italic>D</italic> is either 1 or 2. If <italic>D</italic> is 1, <italic>A</italic> is either 4 or 6, with <italic>I</italic> correspondingly 2 or 8 (<italic>A</italic> cannot be 5, because the value of the expression would be <italic>DA</italic>). If <italic>D</italic> is 2, <italic>A</italic> is 7, 8, or 9, with <italic>I</italic> correspondingly 1, 4, or 7. The numbers 8, 2, and 4 are assigned to the letters <italic>A</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, and <italic>I</italic>, and the remaining letters are guessed. Expression 2, <italic>B</italic> + <italic>B</italic> + <italic>B</italic>, results in the value <italic>DF</italic>.</p>

<title>Add all ten letters on Trial 1</title>
<p>The sum of the integers from 0 to <italic>N</italic> is given by Gauss’s formula <italic>N</italic> (<italic>N</italic> + 1)/2. The value of the expression that adds all ten letters <italic>A</italic> + <italic>B</italic> + <italic>C</italic> + <italic>D</italic> + <italic>E</italic> + <italic>F</italic> + <italic>G</italic> + <italic>H</italic> + <italic>I</italic> + <italic>J</italic> will be 9(10)/2 = 45, identifying the letters coded as 4 and 5.

<title>Simulation method and results</title>
<p>Before the experiments were conducted with real people, we developed and ran simulations for pure guessing and for each instructed strategy. We simulated a baseline strategy of pure guessing in which any expression is proposed, the value is ignored, and unique numbers are guessed for the remaining unidentified letters both within and across trials. All simulations used a matrix of letters versus numbers to record all known information and to guide the next submission. The simulation graphically marks the matrix so that the logic can be monitored. When a letter is correctly identified, the cell at that letter and number is marked as correct, and all other cells in that letter row and in that number column are marked as impossible. If the value is the same as the input (J + J = J), then that letter must be 0, so the J0 cell is marked to show that assignment as correct, and all other cells in that letter J row and number 0 column are marked as impossible. If the value is a single letter (J + J = C) then J must be less than 5, so all cells J5 thru J9 are marked as impossible. Also the value must be even, so J1, J3, J5, J7, J9 are marked as impossible for the value letter. If the sum is two digits (D + D = BE), then the left digit (B) must be 1, and the matrix is marked at B1 as correct, and all other cells in row B and column 1 as marked as impossible. Also, the right digit (E) must be even, so E1, E3, E5, E7, E9 are marked as impossible for the right letter. For the next expression, the simulation uses an unknown letter. For the guesses, the simulation uses only possible numbers for each letter. When only one cell remains unknown in any row or any column, that cell is assigned. All simulation results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368430211419174">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Experimental method</title>
<sec id="section12-1368430211419174">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The participants were 600 college students who received course credit for participation. Half of them were randomly assigned to solve four successive letters-to-numbers problems (with different random codings of letters to numbers) as a three-person group, and half as individuals. The groups or individuals solved four problems under the five instruction conditions: (1) standard unconstrained; (2) use two identical letters on all expressions; (3) use three identical letters on all expressions; (4) use four identical letters on all expressions; (5) add all ten letters on Trial 1. There were 20 three-person groups and 60 individuals in each of the five instruction conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1368430211419174">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Before the participants arrived, the experimenter set up each computer in the computer lab to specify what instruction condition would be used. When the participants arrived, Instructions were provided on the opening computer screen to explain the game and to explain the specific instructions for that condition being used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211419174">Figure 1</xref> shows the opening screen for the unconstrained condition. The groups were instructed to solve the problems cooperatively, reaching agreement on each expression and guess of the numbers to letters for each trial. Each computer automatically recorded all information to a central computer. Only for the unconstrained condition was the player free to apply an invented strategy. For all the other instructed conditions, the computer would only accept inputs of the proper form. For the “Use two identical letters” instruction, “A + A” is accepted, but “A + B”, “A + A + A”, “AA” are all rejected with an explanation. After the fourth problem was completed, the experimenter gave the participants a written debriefing with a reference for further reading, answered any questions, and thanked them for their participation.</p>

<title>Effect of group versus individual</title>
<p>We first determined the best, second-best, and third-best individuals for each set of the 20 sets of three individuals for each of the five instruction conditions by the total number of trials over the four problems. Nonsolvers within the allowed ten trials were counted as 11 trials.</p>
<p>Mean trials to solution averaged over all four problems are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368430211419174">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1368430211419174">Figure 6</xref>. The results of the pure guessing are included as a baseline. Results or simulations are included for each instruction condition. Averaged over all problems, groups outperformed the best individuals in the “Add ten letters”, “Use three letters”, and “Use four letters” conditions, but just equaled best individuals in the unconstrained and two letters conditions : “Use three”, “Use four”, and “Add ten letters” strategies involve more data to potentially use, and requires more memory than the other conditions, and perhaps the groups remember better or use the data better. These results generally support Prediction 1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The three-person groups had fewer trials to solution than the best of an equivalent number of individuals over the five instruction conditions. These results extend the previously demonstrated superiority of groups over the best of an equivalent number of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211419174">Laughlin et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211419174">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211419174">2006</xref>) to a number of further instruction conditions to use various strategies. When instructed to use a given strategy, the groups used it more effectively than the best individuals. We attribute this superiority of groups over the best individuals on letters-to-numbers problems to the highly intellective nature of the problems, as described in the introduction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1368430211419174">Figure 7</xref> top shows that the groups performed better than the strategy of pure guessing on all four problems. This indicates that the groups were able to formulate informative expressions and reason from the resulting values of the expressions to the coding of letters to numbers. The best individuals did not differ from guessing on problem 1, and then performed better than guessing on problems 2, 3, and 4. The second best individuals had more trials than guessing on problem 1, fewer trials than guessing on problem 2, did not differ significantly from guessing on problem 3, and had fewer trials than guessing on problem 4. In contrast, the third-best individuals were not able to reach the level of pure guessing on any of the four problems, and did not exhibit effective reasoning from the values of the expressions.</p>
<p>Some aspects of the group’s process improve outcomes (process gain) and some aspects impair outcomes (process loss) relative to individuals performing alone. Achieving improved group performance depends on maximizing process gains while minimizing losses. Possible process gains include more complete memory, more objective evaluation, synergy, more information availability, stimulation of individual performance, and learning from other group members. Possible process losses occur due to “production blocking” because only one person can communicate at a time, and memory failures because when participants focus on their communication they may miss or forget others’ contributions. Process losses also include such factors as evaluation apprehension, domination of the group by a single member, coordination problems, information overload, conformance pressure, “free riding”, and incomplete task analysis.</p>
<p>With the random assignment to group and individual conditions, each group had members who on average would have performed as best, second-best, or third-best individuals. This further suggests that the group members who did not themselves propose informative expressions and reason effectively from the values of the expressions were able to recognize and accept them if proposed by the better group members who were able to demonstrate them, fulfilling the third and fourth conditions of demonstrability of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211419174">Laughlin and Ellis (1986)</xref>.</p>
<p>Together with three previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211419174">Laughlin et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211419174">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211419174">2006</xref>) these results clearly indicate that cooperative three-person, four-person, and five-person groups perform better than the best of an equivalent number of individuals on letters-to-numbers problems over a wide range of freely chosen and constrained problem- solving strategies, extending the well-documented superiority of problem-solving groups over the average individual (for representative reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211419174">Baron &amp; Kerr, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211419174">Hastie, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211419174">Hill, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211419174">Kerr &amp; Tindale, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211419174">Larson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211419174">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211419174">Nijstad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211419174">Stasser &amp; Dietz-Uhler, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>As predicted, instructions to add all ten letters on Trial 1 resulted in better performance than each of the other four instruction conditions. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1368430211419174">Figure 6</xref>, adding all ten letters identifies the letters coded as 4 and 5, which may then be used effectively in the subsequent expressions.</p>

<p>The columns are numbered from right to left for convenience of exposition. Using a program that randomly assigned the letters to numbers and computed the value of the expression, we solved 300 problems by logical reasoning. The method used by the computer to generate each problem starts with a random coding, then does the addition using those coded numbers, then displays the coded letters for those numbers. So every problem has a solution because the coded letters came from an actual arithmetic sum with numbers.</p>
<p>This expression and sum comprise an interesting and challenging alphanumeric (try it yourself!) as discussed in the psychological literature, where problems such as “DONALD + GERALD = ROBERT” contain all necessary information for solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211419174">Bartlett, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211419174">Newell &amp; Simon, 1972</xref>). The expression and sum may also be considered as an alphametric in the recreational mathematics literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211419174">Mullaney, Carey, and Laughlin (2011)</xref> demonstrate a number of mathematical methods that are effective for solution. Thus future research could provide problem solvers with this type of alphametric assess the ability of groups and individuals to solve the problem. We would predict better performance for groups over the best of an equivalent number of individuals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Letters-to-numbers problems model the scientific method by proposing an expression in letters, learning the value of the expression, proposing the coding of the ten letters to the ten numbers, and learning whether the codings are correct or incorrect. Different strategies may be considered analogs of different experimental procedures. The superiority of groups over the best of an equivalent number of individuals supports the widespread use of research groups and teams in scientific research.</p>

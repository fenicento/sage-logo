<abstract>
<p>The main aim of the present work is to analyze the influence of external weld flash on the formability of friction stir welding sheets through in-plane plane-strain formability tests. The load-extension behavior and forming limit strains are measured to quantify the formability. The influence of friction stir welding parameters on the height of weld flash was also studied. The base materials used for welding trials are AA6061T6 and AA5052H32 alloy sheets of 2.1-mm thickness. It is observed that the influence of external weld flash on the maximum load and total extension for all the friction stir welding conditions is negligible. The effect of weld flash on the limiting major strain is also insignificant. But the presence of weld flash has changed the limiting minor strain, more toward plane-strain condition, indicating the change in strain-path toward plane-strain. This is due to the strain taken by weld flash, along with the major strain, minor strain, and thickness strain in the friction stir welding sheet plane because of constancy of volume. The formation of weld flash and its height are affected synergistically by the axial force and temperature development during friction stir welding. The higher the axial force and temperature, the higher the flash height.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Friction stir welding (FSW) is carried out by plunging a rotating hardened tool into the interface of two rigidly clamped sheets, until the shoulder touches the surface of the material being welded, and moved along the weld interface. Welding is initiated by the heat generated between the tool and the workpiece. In this stage, the heat generated by plastic deformation is lower when compared with the frictional heat. The frictional heat increases to a point till there is seizure phenomenon between the tool and the workpiece. This means the contact condition between the tool and the work material changes from the slipping mode to sticking mode. The complete stirring of the material is initiated at this point. After this stage is reached, the whole of the frictional heat is generated by the high strain-rate plastic deformation of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309324713488884">1</xref></sup> The important parameters in FSW are tool material and its geometry (both pin and shoulder), welding speed, tool rotational speed, axial force, and workpiece materials. An appropriate combination of these parameters determines the quality of welds including the presence of defects and microstructure, and hence as a consequence, the mechanical properties and formability of FSW sheets get affected.</p>
<p>There are many studies that are focused on the analyses of weld defect formation and their relation with FSW parameters. The influence of these defects on the mechanical performance of FSW sheets is also studied. Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324713488884">2</xref></sup> analyzed the effect of welding speed and rotational speed on the pore formation during FSW of AZ31 magnesium alloy. It is observed from their results that larger pores are formed at the higher welding speed for constant rotational speed. Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309324713488884">3</xref></sup> studied the effect of tool tilt angle on the defect formation of Al 5456 welds and showed that at lower tilt angle, insufficient material flow occurs and kissing-bond defect is formed, while at higher tile angle, because of weld flash formation, no sufficient material fill-up happens in the weld zone forming voids. Arbegast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309324713488884">4</xref></sup> proposed a model based on critical mass evaluation at different regions of FS welds to identify the formation of defect. Kumar and Kailas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324713488884">5</xref></sup> studied the defect formation during FSW of 7020T6 Al alloy by monitoring the effect of axial load on the presence of voids. It is seen from their results that the defects have disappeared above an axial load of 7.4 kN. They have also identified and proposed the pin-driven and shoulder-driven material flow for weld zone formation. Leal and Loureiro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309324713488884">6</xref></sup> showed that defects can be repaired through overlapping welding passes using 3-mm-thick plates of 5083-O and 6063-T6 alloys. This method does not change the microstructure of the welds in 5083-O sample, while marginal increase in hardness and tensile strength is observed in both the materials. Lee and Jung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324713488884">7</xref></sup> indicated that for defect-free weld joints made of copper, 1250 r/min rotational speed and 61 mm/min welding speed should be used. The tensile behavior studies showed that the tensile strength of FSW copper joint in transverse direction exhibits 87% of tensile strength of base metal. It is also observed that failure occurred near the heat-affected zone (HAZ) where lower hardness was observed. Uyyuru and Kailas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309324713488884">8</xref></sup> through numerical simulations in Design Environment for Forming (DEFORM), have shown that location of welding defects can be predicted in terms of tensile mean stresses. The mean stresses are compressive in nature, but tensile mean stresses are seen in the vicinity of contact interface between the pin and the plate. It has been shown that the presence of tensile mean stresses on the advancing side (AS) of the weld can lead to occurrence of weld defects, like crack. The defect formation can be predicted through simulations because tensile mean stresses cause nucleation of cracks. They have also concluded that for attaining a symmetric temperature profile, it is better to tilt the tool in appropriate direction.</p>
<p>By performing FSW of Cu plates and 1060 Al alloy, Xue et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309324713488884">9</xref></sup> concluded that defect-free butt joints are formed when hard Cu plate is placed on the AS, when the pin offsets are larger than 2 mm to the Al matrix, and when the rotational rates are higher. It is revealed by Bisadi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309324713488884">10</xref></sup> that during lap FSW of Cu to AA5083 plates, channel-type defects are formed at very low welding temperatures, and cavities are formed at extremely high temperatures. The influence of base material conditions like 2219-O and 2219-T6 on the FSW characteristics reveals that in 2219-O, the defects are prone to occur in the lower part of the weld on the AS, while it is formed in the upper part of AS in 2219-T6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309324713488884">11</xref></sup> The tensile test results show that the strength efficiency of 2219-O joints is 100%, and the 2219-T6 joints is only up to 82%. This is mainly due to the fracture occurring in base material in 2219-O joints, while HAZ fracture is seen in 2219-T6 joints. The effect of tool pin profile and welding speed on the defect formation and tensile properties is studied on FSW of AA2219 Al alloy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309324713488884">12</xref></sup> Through optimization, it has been shown that a square pin profiled tool at a welding speed 0.76 mm/s delivered maximum tensile strength, higher hardness, and finer grains in the processed region.</p>
<p>Zhang and Zhang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309324713488884">13</xref></sup> have shown, through numerical simulations, that the friction stir weld quality can be improved by increasing the rotational speed and decreasing the welding speed. But when the rotating speed is increased beyond a critical limit, the weld flash becomes more prominent at the same time, which will affect the weld quality and hence the final mechanical properties. Atharifar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324713488884">14</xref></sup> studied the material flow and heat transfer in FSW through numerical simulations and performed an extensive study. Some of the important conclusions from their study are showing that the rotational speed has a major influence on the extent of the axial force, lateral force, and moment applied to the tool, and the power is varied by the traverse velocity only at the higher rotational speeds (angular velocities). Ramulu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324713488884">15</xref></sup> have shown that the formation of defect-free joints is related to the process parameters and axial force and torque combinations. It is found that axial force and torque are found to increase with an increase in welding speed and shoulder diameter. A decreasing trend is observed in axial force and torque while increasing the rotational speed. They have also proposed and validated a simple criterion to identify the onset of defect-free welds. Ghosh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309324713488884">16</xref></sup> optimized the FSW parameters for wrought A356 and 6061T6 Al alloy combination and suggested that the specimen made at lowest tool rotational speed and traversing speed exhibits better mechanical properties with respect to the others.</p>
<p>Cui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309324713488884">17</xref></sup> fabricated three different T-joints through FSW and performed defect analysis and tensile tests to understand their performance. There are four types of defects, namely, tunnel defect, original joint line with severe plastic deformation defect, kissing bond, and zigzag line, and they are seen in FSW AA6061 T-joints. In tensile tests, samples failed by ductile fracture are characterized by fracture at HAZ and thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ). These samples showed good mechanical properties as compared with samples failed by brittle fracture. The brittle fractures occurred in samples with features of defects inducing failure modes. The residual stress characterization of welds made by FSW was performed by Jun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309324713488884">18</xref></sup> and Fratini and Pasta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309324713488884">19</xref></sup> Jun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309324713488884">18</xref></sup> analyzed the residual stress variation during FSW of 12%-Cr steel plates through different approaches of neutron diffraction technique. Fratini and Pasta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309324713488884">19</xref></sup> fabricated butt joint, lap joint, and T-joint made of AA2024-T4 and AA7075-T6 Al alloys and measured the residual stress through cut compliance method. In all cases, the utilization of an in-process water flux reduces the welding residual stresses while process parameters showed no effect. Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309324713488884">20</xref></sup> concluded that for better forming performance of FSW sheets made of a variety of aluminum and high strength steel sheets, weld zone arrangement and the weld zone ductility and strength are important. The weld line alignment with respect to loading direction decides the strain localization. Weld zone ductility is important if it is oriented parallel to the loading direction, while strength is important if it is perpendicular to the loading direction. From the study of Miles et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309324713488884">21</xref></sup> an important result showing that the forming limit curves (FLCs) for 5182/6022 and 5754/6022 pairs are maximum at plane-strain, and that slope toward minimum values in biaxial tension strain-path should be noted. Recently, Ramulu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309324713488884">22</xref></sup> presented the influence of tool rotational speed and welding speed on the forming limit of FSW sheets made of Al 6061T6 material. They concluded that FSW sheets made at different welding speeds (90 and 100 mm/min) and at different tool rotational speeds (1300 and 1400 r/min) exhibit higher forming limit as compared with unwelded sheets. Silva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309324713488884">23</xref></sup> evaluated the manufacturability of friction stir welded sheets made of AA1050-H111 sheets of 1.5- and 2-mm thicknesses through single point incremental forming (SPIF). The benchmark forming tests were performed in truncated conical and pyramidal shapes characterized by varying drawing angles with the depth. Later it was demonstrated that, if defect-free weld joints are produced, the combination of SPIF and FSW sheets can produce good formable components. A review by Ma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309324713488884">24</xref></sup> describes the friction stir processing technology in a detailed manner.</p>
<p>It can be perceived from the available literature that for an improved performance of FSW joints and sheets, they should be defect free. The welding parameters are optimized mainly for this reason. It is a known fact that the presence of internal defects like voids affects the mechanical performance significantly. Zhang and Zhang,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309324713488884">13</xref></sup> in their conclusions, have suggested that when the rotating speed is increased beyond a critical limit, the weld flash becomes more prominent, which will affect the final weld quality. Consequently, this will affect the final mechanical performance of the FSW sheets. This particular fact has become the basis for the present work.</p>
<p>The main aim of the present work is to study the influence of external weld flash on the formability of FSW sheets made of AA6061T6 and AA5052H32 alloys. The formability of FSW sheets is quantified by load-extension behavior and forming limit strain. The formability of FSW sheets having external weld flash and without flash (flash removed by machining) is compared for this purpose. The effect of FSW parameters on the height of flash is also presented. The in-plane plane-strain (IPPS) formability tests have been conducted to evaluate the formability of welded sheets.</p>

<title>Base material properties</title>
<p>The base materials used for the present work are AA6061T6 and AA5052H32 alloy sheets of 2.1-mm thickness. The mechanical and forming properties of the base material were obtained from standard tensile tests by following American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) B557 and ASTM E517 standards. The tensile properties were evaluated at seven different rolling directions, 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90°, as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309324713488884">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0309324713488884">2</xref> for AA5052H32 and AA6061T6, respectively, per standard procedure. The tensile samples were made using CO<sub>2</sub> laser cutting machine. All samples were tested using an Instron 8801 machine at a constant cross-head speed of 1 mm/min at room temperature. The plastic strain ratios (<italic>R</italic>) were also evaluated at seven different rolling directions per standard procedure. Three trials of tensile tests were conducted for each rolling direction to check the repeatability and property variation.</p>

<title>Optimization of IPPS formability test sample and limit strain measurement</title>
<p>In this work, the forming limit at the plane-strain condition during in-plane formability is of particular interest. This is termed as IPPS formability test. The main reason is that in plane-strain mode of deformation, the material exhibits the lowest limit strain, that is, it is the least limit strain in a FLC of that sheet. Also the in-plane forming limit strains are not affected by bending and friction between the tools that is generally seen in out-of-plane formability tests such as limit dome height tests.</p>
<p>The initial IPPS formability test sample design was taken from the work of Holmberg et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309324713488884">25</xref></sup> although there are other sample designs and methods as suggested by Wagoner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309324713488884">26</xref></sup> and Raghavan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309324713488884">27</xref></sup> In this sample, a semicircular notch is provided in the center region with certain height and width that generates plane-strain strain-path during forming. In order to identify the optimum dimensions, since performing experiments is cumbersome and expensive, many finite element (FE) simulations were performed in PAMSTAMP 2G, an elastic-plastic FE code. During simulation, the IPPS formability sample was generated and meshed using deltamesh facility in PAMSTAMP 2G. The mesh size used was 1 mm and base material consisted of quadrilateral shell elements of the Belytschko–Tsay formulation with five through thickness integration points. The Hollomon’s power law (<italic>σ = Kε<sup>n</sup></italic>, where <italic>σ is</italic> true stress, <italic>K</italic> is the strength coefficient, <italic>ε</italic> true strain, and <italic>n</italic> is the strain-hardening exponent) was used as the strain-hardening law. The Hill’s (1948) isotropic hardening yield criterion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309324713488884">28</xref></sup> was used as the plasticity model.</p>
<p>About 50 simulations were performed on base materials by incorporating the material properties evaluated earlier and with different notch and sample widths. The sample dimensions that resulted in near plane-strain condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324713488884">Figure 1(a)</xref>) were used to make actual formability test samples from FSW sheets containing weld region at the center, along the major straining direction. These optimized IPPS samples have a notch width of 12 mm and a depth of 8 mm. The FE simulation results of a nonoptimized (notch width of 10 mm and depth of 6 mm) sample and the optimized sample showing the strain-path closer to plane-strain condition during necking is also presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324713488884">Figure 1(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324713488884">(c)</xref>. The IPPS FSW samples were fabricated using a 2.5kW CO<sub>2</sub> laser cutting machine. The diagram of sample was first fed into the computer interface with all the dimensions. The large size FSW sheet was clamped by sample holders, and the laser heat source was passed on the sample per the diagram supplied to the computer for making the IPPS sample. A schematic describing the steps involved in fabricating the IPPS FSW samples is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324713488884">Figure 2</xref>. All the experimental FSW sheets had external weld flash. Now two sets of samples were made—in the first set, the weld flash was retained, and in the second set, the weld flash was removed by machining. The circular grid pattern was applied on the central portion of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324713488884">Figure 1(d)</xref>), to evaluate the forming limit strains, which is a combination of true major strain and true minor strain, of FSW sheets after failure. The IPPS forming tests were performed for all the FSW sheets shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0309324713488884">Table 3</xref> using an 8801 Instron machine at 1 mm/min cross-head speed. After testing, the dimensions of major axis and minor axis of elliptical grids in the necked region in weld zone were measured for FSW sheets with external flash and without external flash using the profile projector for evaluating the limit strain. The load-extension behavior for FSW sheets with weld flash and without flash was also obtained from the machine.</p>

<title>FSW experiments</title>
<p>The initial FSW trials were performed within chosen range of welding parameters such as shoulder diameter, plunger depth, welding (traverse) speed, and rotational speed. The chosen range of welding parameters are 900–2100 r/min for rotational speed, 60–260 mm/min for traverse speed, 1.65–1.95 mm for plunge depth, and 12–18 mm for shoulder diameter. During these welding trials, one welding parameter, for example, welding speed, is varied continuously between two chosen values to complete a single weld. Similarly, all other parameters are varied in a single welding trial. This has basically reduced the number of welding trials and sheet materials drastically by about 60%. The welded samples were sectioned and polished by following a standard metallographic procedure and checked for the presence of internal defects at different lengths of the weld region. The welding conditions that yielded defect-free welds were considered as optimized. During welding trials, AA6061T6 was placed on the AS and AA5052H32 on the retreating side (RS). The final optimized welding parameters range are 1000–2000 r/min for rotational speed, 80–240 mm/min for traverse speed, 1.85–1.95 mm for plunge depth, for 12, 16, and 18 mm shoulder diameters. A tool tilt angle of 2.5° was maintained constant during welding.</p>
<p>Within the optimized range of welding parameters, 12 different welding conditions, for example, from case 1 to 12, were considered as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0309324713488884">Table 3</xref> for making FSW sheets. It has been taken care during welding that all these conditions generate FSW sheets with external weld flash. Four FSW samples were made in each case. In two of the four samples, the external flash was removed by machining with belt emery machine, and in other two samples, the weld flash was kept as it is, except in the gripping region. This means that two different FSW samples will be tested, one with external weld flash and the other without flash, but both are made at same welding conditions (from case 1 to 12). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324713488884">Figure 3</xref> shows the tested IPPS test samples containing external weld flash and without flash. The IPPS formability samples were made using 2.5 kW CO<sub>2</sub> laser cutting machine. All the samples corresponding to conditions from case 1 to 12 were tested using an Instron 8801 machine at a constant cross-head speed of 1 mm/min at room temperature.</p>

<title>Influence of weld flash on load-extension behavior</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324713488884">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324713488884">5</xref> show the influence of external weld flash on the maximum load and total extension of FSW sheets for different FSW cases. Here, comparison is made between FSW sheets with external weld flash and without flash (flash removed by machining). It can be seen that the external flash does not affect the maximum load and extension. Only a slight difference is observed between them in some of the cases. A maximum difference of 0.8 kN in maximum load and 0.4 mm in extension is seen in case 2 and case 9, respectively, which are negligible. This is opposite to what is generally seen in the case of internal defects like voids. The presence of internal voids will affect the maximum load and extension to a large extent as compared with the defect-free weld case as seen from the existing literature.</p>

</fig>
<p>When the FSW sheet with weld flash deforms, although the welded region, base material, and weld flash strain together, it is observed that failure happens first in the welded region and then propagates to the weld flash. Since the welded region and base material are in same plane, that is, on the plane of the sample, failure occurs at the same stage. Then the failure propagates to the next plane, which is just above the sample plane, where the weld flash is present and then the failure of weld flash denotes the full sample failure. In the case of FSW sheet without weld flash (flash removed by machining), failure occurs only on the welded region and base material, that is, on the sample plane. Here failure means the onset of necking in the FSW sample. All the experiments are stopped once necking is observed on the sample; beyond this stage, no useful deformation occurs. In the case of FSW sample with weld flash, the testing was continued till flash fails.</p>
<p>Now the difference in maximum load and extension between these two cases depends on two factors: (1) the strength of external weld flash and (2) the rate at which failure propagates from the sample plane (or base of the weld flash) to the top most point of the flash. These two factors are important because (1) stronger weld flash will bear additional maximum load for certain deformation as compared with the case without flash and (2) the rate at which failure propagates to the flash from the sample plane determines the additional extension of the sample with flash as compared with the sample without flash. Now the load-bearing ability of the flash depends on its dimensions. Since the weld flash is thinner and has got less height within a range of 2–8 mm, as compared with the total sample width, its effect is negligible, resulting in less difference between maximum loads of FSW sheet with weld flash and without flash. It has been observed during experimentation that propagation of failure from sample plane, that is, after necking, to the weld flash is instantaneous. If the total sample width of 24 mm containing both the weld zone and the base material fails almost at the same stage of deformation, the weld flash of 2–8 mm height will also fail at same stage of forming, resulting in very less difference between total extensions of FSW sheet with weld flash and without flash. Because of the above-mentioned reasons, the difference between maximum load and extension is negligible between FSW sheets with flash and without flash.</p>

<title>Influence of weld flash on forming limit strain</title>
<p>The effect of weld flash on the forming limit strain, which constitutes limiting major strain and limiting minor strain of FSW sheet, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713488884">Figure 6(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713488884">(b)</xref>, respectively. The effect of weld flash on the limiting major strain is negligible as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713488884">Figure 6(a)</xref>. A very small difference of less than 1% in limiting major strain is observed in few cases, which is negligible. Since the presence of weld flash does not affect the extension because of lesser flash height and fast propagation of failure from base of flash to the top most point of the flash, the major limiting strain is also not affected.</p>

</fig>
<p>On the contrary, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713488884">Figure 6(b)</xref> shows that in all the conditions, the true minor strain, which represents the strain-path in any forming limit diagram, is close to zero for FSW sheets with weld flash as compared with FSW sheets without flash. This means that the presence of weld flash has changed the strain-path more toward plane-strain condition, in which the limiting minor strain is zero. This is clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324713488884">Figure 7</xref> for two different conditions, case 2 and case 5. This figure indicates that the strain-path of FSW sheets with weld flash is shifting more toward plane-strain condition as compared with the cases without flash (flash removed by machining), under proportional loading.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309324713488884-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The effect of weld flash on the changing strain-path toward plane-strain condition can be understood by monitoring the evolution of major, minor, and thickness strain in the FSW sheet (in the sheet plane) during necking. Since the limiting major strains are almost equal in FSW sheet with weld flash and without flash as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713488884">Figure 6(a)</xref>, and limiting minor strain in FSW sheet without flash is larger than the case with weld flash as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324713488884">Figure 6(b)</xref>, the thickness strain for FSW sheets without weld flash should be larger than the case with flash, in order to maintain volume constancy during forming. This means that the thinning would be more in the case of FSW sheets without weld flash (flash removed by machining), which concludes that this would exhibit lesser thickness in the necked region, as compared with the case with weld flash. In other words, it can be said that the lesser amount of thinning in the case of FSW sheet with weld flash is due to the strain taken by the weld flash, which is absent in the case of FSW sheet without flash. In summary, the reduction in limiting minor strain in FSW sheets with weld flash, signifying the change in strain-path toward plane-strain, is due to the strain taken by weld flash also, along with the major strain, minor strain, and thickness strain in the FSW sheet plane, indicating the constancy of material volume in the weld region. This is absent in the case of FSW sheet without flash.</p>

<title>Influence of FSW parameters on the weld flash height</title>
<p>The effect of four important parameters on the flash height during FSW is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>. The flash height was measured using vernier height gauge at five different locations along the length of the weld flash, and average height is used for the analyses. The variation of flash height at different locations is observed to be very less. The following effects are observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>—increase in traverse speed decreases the flash height, decrease in plunge depth decreases the flash height, increase in tool rotational speed increases the flash height, and increase in shoulder diameter increases the flash height. These effects can be understood from the axial force delivered to the weld region and temperature development during welding. It is believed that the higher the axial force because of larger squeezing action and constancy of volume, the more the weld flash height will be. Also the temperature is expected to increase with the increasing rotational speed or increasing shoulder diameter or increasing plunge depth or decreasing traverse (weld) speed. The higher the temperature, the more soft the material will be and easier for flash to form, and in consequence, the flash height is influenced.</p>

</fig>
<p>It has been shown by Atharifar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324713488884">14</xref></sup> that with increase in angular velocity, for example, from 30 to 130 rad/s, the axial force increases from 13 to 17 kN approximately. So increasing the rotational speed would increase the axial force, and hence the weld flash height, which is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>. Similarly with the increase in rotational speed, the peak temperature is found to increase as shown in Li et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309324713488884">29</xref></sup> study, making the material softer, and hence the flash height has increased in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly, increasing the traverse speed decreases the axial force as seen in Atharifar et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324713488884">14</xref></sup> study, and hence, the flash height has decreased in the present work as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>. In a similar fashion, increasing the traverse speed decreases the peak temperature during welding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309324713488884">29</xref></sup> and hence, the flash height has decreased.</p>
<p>It can be understood from Ramulu et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324713488884">15</xref></sup> study that with decrease in plunge depth, the axial force decreases considerably. With decrease in axial force, the flash height would decrease. Decreasing the plunge depth would decrease the peak temperature and hence the flash height. This is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>.</p>
<p>The work done by Ramulu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324713488884">15</xref></sup> reveals that when the shoulder diameter is increased, higher axial force values were observed, and hence the flash height has increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>). Zhang et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309324713488884">30</xref></sup> work reveals that with increase in shoulder diameter, the peak temperature increases during welding and hence the flash height would increase as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324713488884">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The following conclusions are drawn from the present work.</p>
<list id="list1-0309324713488884" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The influence of external weld flash on the maximum load and total extension for all the FSW conditions is negligible. This is mainly due to the insensitiveness of these responses on the flash because of its thinner dimension and faster propagation of failure from bottom of the flash to the top most point.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The effect of weld flash on the limiting major strain is negligible. A small difference of less than 1% in limiting major strain is observed in certain cases. But the presence of weld flash has changed the limiting minor strain, more toward plane-strain condition, indicating a reduction in minor strain values. This depicts the change in strain-path more toward plane-strain condition.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The reduction in limiting minor strain in FSW sheets with weld flash is due to the strain taken by weld flash, along with the major strain, minor strain, and thickness strain in the FSW sheet plane, indicating the constancy of material volume.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The formation of weld flash and its height are affected synergistically by the axial force and temperature development during FSW. Increasing the traverse speed or decreasing the plunge depth decreases the flash height. Increase in tool rotational speed or shoulder diameter increases the flash height. In a similar manner, the higher the temperature, for any combination of welding parameters, the more soft the material will be and easier for flash to form, and in consequence, the flash height is influenced. This is in qualitative agreement with the literature results.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, as long as the material volume remains same in the weld region, either with flash or without flash (flash removed by machining), for same welding parameters, formability of FSW sheets will not be affected significantly. This is observed from the load-extension data and limiting major strain in the present work. For inappropriate welding parameter combinations, weld flash will form, consequently affecting the height of flash.</p></list-item>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Around a third of people with stroke experience persisting problems with aphasia or
        dysarthria, limiting their ability to communicate through speech, writing or
            gesture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512450042">1</xref></sup> This
        restricts everyday activities and social participation, has adverse psychological effects
        and negatively impacts on families and informal caregivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512450042">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512450042">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The ACT NoW Study (Assessing Communication Therapy in the North West), used a mixed-methods
        approach (randomized controlled trial and qualitative study) to examine the effectiveness,
        cost-effectiveness, service use and service users’ views of early, intensively resourced,
        flexible intervention delivered by speech and language therapists, compared with an
        equivalent amount of contact but not therapy provided by ‘visitors’ (employees not
            volunteers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup> This
        paper focuses on the qualitative study. It explored, through individual interview, trial
        participants’ perceptions of the process and outcomes of either the intervention (speech and
        language therapy) or attention control (visitor contact).</p>
      <p>Patients were externally randomized to either speech and language therapy which commenced
        as soon as clinically indicated at a maximum frequency of three contacts per week for up to
        16 weeks, or to a visitor. Visitors were trained to deliver social attention and activities
        absent of any intuitive form of communication therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512450042">5</xref></sup> Both the intervention and the attention
        control were, therefore, defined in part by human agency.</p>
      <p>This study seeks to disentangle the effects of the person (visitor or speech and language
        therapist) from what they actually did (intervention or attention control) within the trial.
        This is needed because, while trials are good at providing robust evidence about whether an
        intervention is effective, they are less good at explaining why a result has
            occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512450042">6</xref></sup> This is
        a particularly pertinent issue for non-pharmacological trials where the personal and social
        context in which an intervention occurs inevitably will assert some kind of
            influence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512450042">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512450042">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The qualitative study was designed to enable participants to identify factors which they
        regarded as important in evaluating the process as well as the outcomes of their
        experiences. The analysis of these perceptions, while standing alone, was also intended as
        contributory evidence toward explaining potential variations in effectiveness within and
        between groups in the trial. This paper is, therefore, published as a companion to the
        randomized controlled trial. It contributes to the debate about the implications of the main
        trial results for professional behaviour, patient experience and service delivery.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>Both trial participants and carers were involved in the qualitative study but only results
        from participant interviews are reported here. The study’s formal research aims were:</p>
      <list id="list1-0269215512450042" list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>to explore participants’ experiences of speech and language therapy intervention or
            visitor attention control;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>to evaluate from participants’ perspectives the effectiveness of speech and language
            therapy intervention or visitor attention control, both in terms of process and
            outcome;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>to compare the perceived impact on participant well-being of speech and language
            therapy intervention or visitor attention control.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>We approached all participants in the ACT NoW study who had completed their post-outcome
        (six-month) assessment between June 2008 and April 2009. ACT NoW exclusion criteria meant
        that there were no potential participants with pre-existing learning disabilities or
        dementia likely to prevent benefits from therapy, subarachnoid haemorrhage, serious medical
        conditions (e.g. terminal disease), unable to complete eligibility screening even after
        three attempts or, with communication problems that had already resolved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The study obtained Multicentre Research Ethics Committee approval (06/MRE03/42). Informed
        consent for participation in the qualitative study was obtained from each participant
        separately from their informed consent to participate in the randomized controlled trial.
        This was (1) to ensure that any concerns about having to be interviewed did not unduly
        influence recruitment to the main trial; (2) to distinguish the aims of the qualitative
        study from other aspects of the trial so that it would be clear what might be expected of
        those who agreed to be interviewed.</p>
      <p>The original intention had been to purposively sample, based on such criteria as severity
        of impairment, age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status. However there were limited
        numbers of eligible participants at the time of data collection, therefore a whole sample
        approach was used. Of the 36 potential participants, 22 agreed to take part drawn from 8 out
        of the 12 sites in which ACT NoW took place. Of those who did not participate, 5 had
        withdrawn from the trial, 6 did not consent, 2 declined information about the qualitative
        study and 1 was readmitted to hospital. Sixteen (73%) participants had a baseline
        communication impairment that was rated in the ‘severe’ category on the Therapy Outcome
            Measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512450042">9</xref></sup> This
        proportion is similar to that in the non-participant group (<italic>n =</italic> 11) (79%)
        and in the larger sample (<italic>n =</italic> 170) in the randomized controlled trial
            (68%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Twelve participants had been randomized into the speech and language therapy group, 10 into
        the visitor group. There were 13 men and 9 women in the sample with a median age of 73 years
        (range: 53–98 years). Five had a diagnosis of dysarthria, 12 of aphasia and 5 had both
        aphasia and dysarthria. The self-rated Communication Outcomes After Stroke (COAST)
            scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512450042">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512450042">11</xref></sup> was designed to ascertain
        perceived level of communication disability and impact on daily life. Eleven of the
        qualitative sample scored above the median on COAST, 6 had scores up to the median and in 5
        of cases there were three or more missing values, indicating a more severe degree of
        disability.</p>
      <sec id="section10-0269215512450042">
        <title>Interviews</title>
        <p>Qualitative interviewing of participants with aphasia/dysarthria is entirely
              possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512450042">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512450042"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512450042">14</xref></sup> but some basic assumptions of
          qualitative interviewing cannot be taken for granted, such as sustained narrative
          engagement. Typically people with aphasia or dysarthria can vary considerably in the
          extent to which they might have impairments in expression and/or understanding.
          Adaptations by the interviewer and a more structured approach to data elicitation are
              helpful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512450042">11</xref></sup> We
          maximized the potential involvement of participants with the greatest difficulty
          communicating by training the interviewer (TG) in the techniques of Supported Conversation
          for adults with Aphasia (SCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512450042">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512450042">16</xref></sup> and
          through the design of the interview.</p>
        <p>The interview method incorporated prompt cards for expressions, pictorial representations
          of activities and visual analogue scales to represent degrees of emotion or
              opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512450042">6</xref></sup> These
          communication ramps could be used in different ways depending on the individual’s degree
          and kind of communication difficulty. They could be ignored, or used simply as an
          aide-memoire to remain focused on the topic of discussion. They might replace specific
          words/expressions that the participant was unable to articulate, or pointing to them
          combined with gesture might be used to convey meaning. What was important was that the
          form of the interview and the means of the interview were maximally flexible to encourage
          participation from people with different communication needs and strengths. The ACT NoW
          research user group, made up of people with aphasia and/or dysarthria, also supplied the
          interviewer with training through means of role play and feedback on mock interviews in
          which they both participated and critically observed.</p>
        <p>The interview schedule was divided into three sections: (1) questions that invited a
          discussion of what had taken place during their contact with the speech and language
          therapist or visitor (description); (2) questions that encouraged participants to explore
          what they thought about the contact with speech and language therapist or visitor
          (appraisal); (3) and questions that invited participants to judge the impact of their
          experience on themselves or others (evaluation). All interviews were video recorded to
          capture verbal and non-verbal expression.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section11-0269215512450042">
        <title>Analysis</title>
        <p>The data varied in style of expression, degree of elaboration and intelligibility. The
          vast majority were amenable to conventional forms of transcription. In two of interviews
          there was either so little spoken language expression and/or non-verbal communication that
          the intended meaning was uncertain. In a further three there were some instances of
          ambiguous content. We developed a data transformation protocol to manage data where
          conventional transcription was not possible. It was guided by three principles: (a) a
          respect for participants’ efforts to ensure that their opinions were recorded, by whatever
          media of communication they could use; (b) a concern not to over-interpret data where the
          meaning was not clear; (c) to develop a process that had the potential to address the
          three levels of meaning sought in the data collection: description, appraisal and
          evaluation.</p>
        <p>The data transformation involved the re-presentation of data in a prose form amenable to
          conventional data processing. There were four stages, involving authors TG and AY.</p>
        <p>All data were watched and conventional verbatim transcription applied where there was
          clarity – this included the marking in written form of any gestural communication where
          meaning was straightforward.</p>
        <p>All data were re-watched and where there were gaps in the verbatim text transcription the
          researcher added notes using the QSR NVivo tool ‘data-bites’. These notes addressed the
          possible meaning of the data and degree of certainty of interpretation.</p>
        <p>Where the researcher was less confident about the interpretations, an experienced speech
          and language therapist watched the relevant sections of video and independently
          interpreted the meaning. If there was disagreement, the speech and language therapist and
          researcher discussed their interpretations until a collaborative meaning was reached.
          Where agreement was still not possible, the data section was not used.</p>
        <p>A new document was created in NVivo consisting of a prose summary made up of content
          statements derived from the data-bite notes. A link was then created between the
          re-presentation and the original transcript to insert the prose in the appropriate section
          of the original interview.</p>
        <p>We used a thematic analysis approach because we were primarily concerned with
          understanding the content of what participants said and drawing out conceptual frameworks
          based on their perceptions and experiences, rather than analysing how they expressed

        <title>Mood</title>
        <p>Participants identified the positive effect on their mood of their speech and language
          therapy or visitor experiences as a key marker of effectiveness. This positive impact
          could occur either as a result of contact with someone who was friendly and supportive
          serving to lift them out of a low mood, or because such contact could distract them from
          the difficulties of living with the consequences of stroke:<disp-quote>
            <p>If you’ve had a stroke, which is a dreadful thing to have, it’s on your mind the
              whole time and I thought well, at least I’m doing that, I’m starting to have these
              conversations. Which I did . . . it stopped me thinking, it put me in someone else’s
              spot for an hour, didn’t it? I stopped thinking about number one and started thinking
              about somebody else . . . It’s very easy to get involved in your own little thing
              isn’t it? . . . he [the visitor] would tell me different things. Yeah, I think it was
              good. (Visitor contact)</p>

        <p>The professional identity or role of the individual speech and language therapist or
          visitor was of far less importance than their personal qualities in generating such
          positive effects. Participants identified five helpful characteristics for positive
          interactions during contact:</p>

        <title>Confidence</title>
        <p>Both speech and language therapy and visitor experiences were viewed by participants as
          helping to enhance personal confidence but differences in the process of care were
          observed. Those with visitor experience described enhanced confidence in terms of the
          normalizing effects of regular contact with a stranger. Visits meant they had to engage in
          social interaction and face their concerns about communicating with someone who did not
          know them well. They had to practise everyday tasks like getting up to answer the door,
          making a cup of tea and show they could cope beyond their immediate family. Those with
          speech and language therapy experience tended to view improvements in confidence as direct
          consequences of specific tasks and newly acquired strategies, rather than indirect
          benefits of social encounters.</p>
        <p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>Very um . . . helpful she’d [the therapist] point out where you were going wrong and,
              and finding you . . . how to get it right . . . just build your confidence up so
              where, where you think ‘oh, I can’t do that word,’ just, just try a different way or .
              . . work out what you could say instead, take out words you couldn’t say y’know so
              y’know like when they say, oh, I use three words instead of one it’s because you can’t
              do the one (laughs) so use three, it’s easier. (Speech and language therapy)</p>

        <title>Recognising progress</title>
        <p>Participants strongly emphasized the importance of being able to recognize their own
          progress. The extent of improvement was often of less importance than the sense of moving
          forward.</p>
        <p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>He’s [the visitor] done a good job, I was talking to everybody and I don’t know,
              maybe I’m going back, but everybody says, me sister says ‘you can talk a lot better, I
              can understand you now. (Visitor contact)</p>
            <p>It doesn’t seem that much but it is a big thing doing things like that for you and
              one of the girls on the . . . me, meat thing [in the supermarket], she were good
              ‘cause I just had to point to what I wanted, but I saw her last week, she said ‘ooh,
              yes, we know what you can say now can’t you?’ Y’know. (Speech and language
              therapy)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>There was a difference in how speech and language therapy or visitor contact was seen as
          contributing to the observation of progress. Those with therapy experience described how
          the therapist might deliberately point out their areas of weakness or skills they needed
          to develop/re-learn in a targeted way. Before and after measures of how well they were
          doing were also built in.</p>
        <p>For those with visitor experience, the emphasis was on self-perceived differences. Having
          to communicate socially with the same person over time was seen as a good basis for
          self-judgements of improvement. For some people, the fact that the conversation partner
          was not someone who knew them well was important because they had to make additional
          efforts to understand and be understood. For some participants who lived alone or had very
          limited contact with family and friends, an assured social encounter was a prerequisite
          for testing out whether they were getting better. Without it they might not talk regularly
          with anyone.</p>
        <p>For many participants there was an acknowledgement of spontaneous improvement (e.g. in
          speech or mobility). Consequently, the extent to which the visitor or speech and language
          therapist contact was seen to be a contributory factor also varied. Nonetheless, the sense
          of being able to recognize one’s own progress was of overriding importance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section16-0269215512450042">
        <title>Guidance and support</title>
        <p>Participants gave very different descriptions of the kind of guidance and support they
          had received from speech and language therapists or visitors. Visitors were trained not to
          engage in deliberate strategies of therapeutic activity. The fact that participants did
          not perceive them to be doing so is important for evidencing the fidelity of the attention
          control within the trial design. By contrast, participants strongly perceived the
          purposefulness and structure of speech and language therapy, referring to ‘building
          blocks’, ‘strategies’ and ‘deliberate learning’ that was not evident in the data from
          those with visitor experience. However, unique to descriptions of the visitor experience
          was the value participants placed on being able to give to the visitor, usually in
          relation to knowledge and know how. The reciprocity was regarded as therapeutic.</p>
        <p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>I gave her [the visitor] the name of one or two greenfly sprays that I found useful.
              Now it could well have been that she knew all that, but she accepted it in the sense
              that it was new to her, so it made me feel as though I was achieving something
              imparting information. (Visitor contact)</p>

        <title>Meeting individual needs</title>
        <p>Participants highly valued speech and language therapists or visitors who could make
          their interaction seem specifically relevant to the individual. The most effective
          examples of encounters were ones that felt tailored to who the participants were, not just
          what their clinical problem might be.</p>
        <p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>I’m . . . football fanatic so most of the things she [the therapist] got me to read
              and do was over football and that’s where . . . the letter ‘M’ came into it. I found I
              struggled saying [inaudible] . . . [Manchester] United, she did football teams to make
              it interesting for me. She’d pick my interests out and put it into a way of teaching
              me that I enjoyed. I think that’s why I enjoyed the speech therapy so much. (Speech
              and language therapy)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>On the rare occasion when a participant expressed dissatisfaction with the contact they
          had received, failure to recognize individual need or to contextualize the response to the
          individual’s circumstances, were usually components of the problem.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section18-0269215512450042">
        <title>Amount and intensity</title>
        <p>Participants valued a high amount of contact, whether with speech and language therapists
          or visitors. High amount of contact was defined by frequency, number and length of visits
          and/or amount of time spent with them. Furthermore, the amount of support was perceived to
          be closely connected with the benefit. More contact felt like more benefit in quite a
          straightforward equation for the majority of participants. Some participants also
          discussed the importance of frequency of contact being tempered with sensitivity to
          meeting the particular needs which participants were experiencing at any given time. Part
          of this sensitivity was about flexibility and awareness of how easy it might be to feel
          overloaded which could undermine the benefits of a large amount of contact. This was true
          both among those who had speech and language therapy and those who had a visitor. No
          concerns were expressed that the large amount of contact had come too early in their
          recovery process.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The qualitative study nested within the randomized controlled trial was designed: (1) to
        generate data in its own right on participants’ experiences; (2) to be integrated with the
        results of the main trial in order to understand better some of the mechanisms underlying
        the main trial’s results; (3) to contribute to implications for policy and practice that
        might be drawn from the main trial’s results.</p>
      <p>The principal result of the main trial was: ‘that people with aphasia or dysarthria who
        receive an early, well-resourced but individually tailored best practice Speech and Language
        Therapy communication intervention demonstrate similar levels of functional communication
        ability at six months to those who receive visiting from a non-therapist employed to provide
        an attention control consisting largely of informal conversation but no specific
        communication training’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The qualitative study also found that no major differences in impact or effectiveness were
        perceived depending on whether participants had a speech and language therapist or a
        visitor. However, in addition it identified that there were factors common to both
        experimental conditions which participants perceived as important based on their experience
        of one or the other. Namely, that the person with whom they had contact, whether a visitor
        or speech and language therapist, was valued for being an empathic, good communicator who
        could put them at their ease, engage with them in an individualized manner which made them
        feel important, lifted their mood and contributed to their self-perceived sense of progress
        and confidence.</p>
      <p>It was not that participants were blind to the identity or role of the person with whom
        they had contact within the trial. Nor that the differences in the activities of visitor or
        speech and language therapist could not be discerned. It was that both sets of people,
        speech and language therapists and visitors, were valued for similar qualities and effects
        arising from shared positive factors common to both experimental conditions. Neither the
        findings from the main randomized controlled trial nor the qualitative study imply that
        regular contact with any non-professional can have beneficial effects for someone with
        aphasia or dysarthria in the early weeks following a stroke. The qualitative study points to
        specific conditions that would have to be met for that contact to have a positive
        effect.</p>
      <p>The qualitative study was able to identify differences in the experiences of participants
        about the processes of speech and language therapy and visitor contact. Speech and language
        therapy was regarded as purposeful and its effects explicitly measurable. Contact with a
        visitor was regarded as something from which indirect benefits were discernible and measures
        of progress largely self-reflective. This is important in reinforcing the fidelity of the
        attention control within the overall randomized controlled trial design as well as
        demonstrating that the skills techniques and expertise of speech and language therapists are
        evident to the lay participant. Participants did not perceive the speech and language
        therapists and visitors to be doing more or less the same thing.</p>
      <p>The findings from the qualitative study demonstrate that early, regular and sustained
        contact with an individual outside of the participants’ immediate family/friends was
        strongly perceived to be of benefit. The amount and intensity of contact, whether from a
        speech and language therapist or a visitor, was strongly liked and equated by participants
        with greater perceived effectiveness provided that due attention is paid to the possibility
        of an individual feeling overloaded.</p>
      <p>It is worth remembering that the randomized controlled trial in which this qualitative
        study was nested recruited people in the acute stage of stroke and offered up to four months
        of intervention. Therefore, early, well-resourced intervention (average 20 contacts) had
        high user acceptability as long as it was flexible to individual needs. This finding is an
        important contribution to how the implications of the randomized controlled trial results
        are interpreted for future policy and practice in stroke rehabilitation. Seen from this
        study’s participants’ perspective, ‘early and lots of it’ is a stronger message than any
        residual concerns about whether that contact should be provided by a speech and language
        therapist or visitor.</p>
      <sec id="section20-0269215512450042">
        <title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title>
        <p>The main weakness of this study is the small numbers available to participate which
          precluded a purposive approach to sampling. The strongly positive data about early and
          sustained contact might be biased by nature of the sample. It is unknown whether those who
          chose not to participate had more negative views and therefore were less inclined to make
          the further commitment to be interviewed. Also, participants were only interviewed once
          which meant that it was not possible to trace how initial reflections on their experience
          might change with time as recovery and/or enduring disability becomes apparent. Although
          care was taken to ensure that the qualitative analysis was undertaken independent of and
          prior to the analysis of the randomized controlled trial, influences between the two parts
          of the study will inevitably have occurred within a common ACT NoW team. The study is also
          limited by the fact that only service users were interviewed. There is no parallel
          qualitative data from the speech and language therapists or visitors involved.</p>
        <p>The main strength of this study is that the qualitative component of ACT NoW focused on
          the main trial experience, rather than being an element of pre-trial design. It is
          therefore possible to integrate its findings with those of the randomized controlled
          trial. It is also a strength that the qualitative study succeeded in engaging a wide
          diversity of participants, including those with the most severe communication impairments
          and collecting data at a very early stage in stroke patients’ experience. A diagnosis of
          aphasia is a common exclusion criterion from many rehabilitation trials and other research
          designs. Our results show that this exclusion is unjustifiable. It marginalizes people
          with communication problems and produces evidence that is unrepresentative of the clinical
          populations we seek to serve.</p>

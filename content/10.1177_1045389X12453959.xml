<p>The electronic sensing capabilities of parachute fabrics and suspension lines coated with conducting polymers, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and their composites are described. A new synthetic method is described to obtain a thin, strongly adhering coating of conducting polymers on commercial parachute fabrics and suspension lines using oligoanilines as an undercoating. The results indicate that both materials have a sensing ability; however, the coated suspension lines show superior performance compared to the coated parachute fabrics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The performance of a parachute is affected by its lift, drag, and stability. These factors are related to the physical properties of the parachute canopy such as porosity, geometry, and air vent openings. The ability to actively change these physical properties would greatly expand the performance and maneuverability of the parachutes, widen the versatility of the airdrop mission, and enhance the safety of the current parachute systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12453959">Dellicker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12453959">McCann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12453959">Strong, 2003</xref>). In order for the variables of lift and drag to be controlled during flight, an intelligent network of sensors must be instrumented to acquire data throughout the duration of the drop. The relevant data might include strain, load, and aerodynamic pressure. Ideally, adjustments to the parachute geometry or porosity could be made using intelligent actuators based on feedback from strategically placed sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12453959">Glen and Haggard, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12453959">2000</xref>). The sensing technologies could also provide a quantifiable measurement of the maximum strain or tensile load during a drop. This information is important to ensure that the structural integrity of the parachute is not compromised and to assist in understanding the physical dynamics of parachute opening and steady-state flight. From a recent review of smart materials for parachute applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12453959">Favini et al., 2011</xref>), electrically conductive fabrics and suspension lines showed potential for sensing applications. The results presented in this article focus on the sensing capabilities of these two materials.</p>
<p>The electrically conductive fabrics examined in this article are parachute fabrics (PIA-C-7020B, type I) that have been coated with conducting soft electronic organic materials, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), hydrochloride-doped polypyrrole (PPY), or polyaniline (PANI). Fabric coated with CNTs and chemical structures of PPY and PANI are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12453959">Figure 1</xref>. The benefit of a coated fabric, as opposed to a sensor that requires attaching or stitching to a fabric, is the strong bond (hydrophobic interactions, H-bonding) between the fabric and the conductive particles. This bond allows the conductive coating to effectively mimic the deformation in the fabric without disturbing its stiffness, flexibility, and intrinsic motion. If the fabric is deformed, the electrically conductive coating is also deformed, causing its electrical conductivity to change. The relationship between the tensile load and strain in the fabric and the electrical resistance of its conductive coating may enable the conductive fabric to be used as an integrated sensor.</p>

<p>There are many methods to obtain conductive textiles. A straightforward method is to interweave conductive fibers or wires into the weaves of the fabric to form a strain sensor, for example, conductive fibers produced by depositing electrically conducting carbon powder on nylon fibers can be used as modified strain gauges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12453959">Gibbs and Asada, 2004</xref>). Wires composed of Nitinol shape memory alloy when woven into a parachute fabric can be used as a strain gauge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12453959">Lengyel et al.,1999</xref>). Textiles with woven conductive wires can measure the strain in the canopy, but they have a low feasibility for implementation because the conductive wires do not completely mimic the behavior of the parachute fabric due to the difference in mechanical flexibility between the wires and the fabric.</p>
<p>A more effective method is to coat or print a conductive film directly on the textile surface, for example, a thermoplastic elastomer/carbon black nanoparticle composite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12453959">Cochrane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12453959">De Rossi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12453959">In het Panhuis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12453959">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12453959">Mattmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12453959">Surwade et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045389X12453959">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045389X12453959">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Conductive films are usually a mixture of conductive particles, such as carbon black particles or CNT, and a thermoplastic elastomer. The thermoplastic elastomer film is lightweight and highly flexible, which ensures that the film is compatible with the textile without interfering with its mechanical properties. The film is prepared using a solvent process in which the thermoplastic elastomer is in the form of a liquid or gel. This allows the film to be easily and directly deposited onto the textile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12453959">Cochrane et al., 2007</xref>). However, the strain–resistance behavior of a nylon parachute fabric coated with a conductive polymer composite is nonlinear in the 0%–15% strain range, and it is unclear whether this is due to the elasticity of the fabric or the conductive polymer composite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12453959">Cochrane et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12453959">2010</xref>). Beyond 15% strain, the resistance response is approximately linear.</p>
<p>Another effective method for obtaining a conductive textile is to coat the textile in conductive solutions, such as PPY, PANI, or CNT. Conductive polymers such as PPY and PANI are widely used due to their high conductivity and environmental stability, nontoxicity, and ease of preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12453959">Li et al., 2005</xref>). The coatings can be applied by simply immersing the textile into a solution containing the conductive polymer, or the coating can be deposited onto the textile using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). However, the authors ran into significant issues when coating PANI or PPY on commercial parachute fabrics using conventional coating methods. In a later section, a new synthetic method to overcome this challenge is described. In previous studies using other textile materials, the results were more promising. For example, the strain–resistance behavior of a plain knitted fabric consisting of 83% Tactel and 17% Lycra coated with PPY showed that the resistance changes nonlinearly with respect to strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12453959">Li et al., 2005</xref>). However, the change in resistance is fairly consistent across several stretch and relaxation cycles. The strain–resistance behavior of a wool–nylon–Lycra fabric consisting of 95% wool, 4.5% nylon, and 0.5% Lycra coated with CNT was investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12453959">In het Panhuis et al., 2007</xref>). Repeated loading cycles show significant hysteresis in the resistance of the conductive fabric. Coated conductive textiles have considerable potential for implementation on parachute systems due to their high mechanical flexibility, integrated design, and strain sensitivity. However, the published results do not contain extensive mechanical testing of these conductive textiles. Some of these electrically conductive textiles were created for the purpose of having integrated conductive pathways—not for embedded strain sensors, which would explain the lack of published results of mechanical testing on such conductive textiles.</p>
<p>In this study, we describe the sensing performance of the parachute fabrics and suspension lines coated with five different materials: PANI, PPY, CNT, composite of PANI and CNT, and PPY and CNT using a new synthetic method. All the samples were tested under quasi-static and dynamic loading. The samples coated with PANI and composite of PPY and CNT show a good linear relation between the load and resistance in both warp and weft directions, which makes these fabrics as potential candidates to be used as tensile load or strain sensors.</p>
<p>The electrically conductive parachute suspension lines in this study are suspension lines (PIA-C-5040, type III) that have been coated with PANI, PPY, CNT, PANI/CNT, and PPY/CNT. A suspension line that is coated with CNT is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12453959">Figure 2</xref>. The conductive coatings were only applied to the core yarns of the suspension lines. The conductive coating is bonded to the suspension lines in the same manner as the fabrics. Thus, any deformations in the suspension line cause the electrical conductivity of the conductive coatings to change. The relationship between the tensile load and strain in the suspension line and the electrical resistance of its conductive coating may also enable the conductive suspension line to be used as an integrated sensor. The following sections describe the electrically conductive coatings and provide an evaluation of the sensing performance.</p>

<title>Description of electrically conductive coatings</title>
<p>Approximately 3- to 5-µm-thick conductive coatings were obtained on parachute fabrics and suspension lines using five different materials: (a) hydrochloride-doped PANI in the emeraldine oxidation state, (b) hydrochloride-doped PPY, (c) CNT composed of microns long, 20–40 nm thick bundles of individual tubes, (d) a composite of PANI and CNT, and (e) a composite of PPY and CNT.</p>
<sec id="section3-1045389X12453959">
<title>PANI coatings</title>
<p>Unlike other polymer substrates, commercial parachute fabric and suspension lines could not be coated with PANI using conventional coating techniques such as dip coating or spray coating. It is possible that hydrophobic surface finishes used on parachute fabrics are detrimental to obtaining a uniform and strongly adherent coating. For example, dip coating using a solution of undoped PANI (emeraldine base) in <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone results in significant beading and a very patchy and nonuniform coating. The authors have used another method, called in situ adsorption polymerization, to obtain PANI coatings on a variety of substrates, including fabrics. Unlike dip, or spray coating, the fabric itself is used as a template for polymer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12453959">Hong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12453959">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045389X12453959">Oh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12453959">Patil, 2010</xref>). For example, the fabric is immersed in a dilute solution of aniline followed by addition of an oxidizing agent like peroxydisulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X12453959">Surwade et al., 2009b</xref>). The reaction is initiated preferentially on the fabric surface because of its high surface area. The autocatalytic nature of the reaction enables the polymerization to proceed rapidly along the surface of the substrate resulting in a uniform conducting coating of strongly adherent high-molecular-weight PANI. Typically, the reaction is complete in a few minutes. The reaction scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12453959">Figure 3(b)</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, when the above method was attempted using parachute fabrics, the coating obtained was very thin and nonuniform (perhaps due to the commercial surface finishes used). The authors developed a novel coating method to overcome this issue using oligoanilines as an undercoat pretreatment. This method called “dimer-seeded coating” uses the dimer of aniline, <italic>N</italic>-phenyl-<italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine, as a template or seed to initiate bulk polymerization of aniline. The authors have shown previously that when <italic>N</italic>-phenyl-<italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine powder is exposed to ammonium peroxydisulfate in dilute aqueous acids, it instantaneously dimerizes to yield a dark green electrically conducting powder of aniline tetramer as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12453959">Figure 3(a)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X12453959">Surwade et al., 2009b</xref>). It was found that this reaction proceeds just as easily on the surface parachute fabrics and suspension lines. For example, the parachute fabric is first dipped in a dilute solution of <italic>N</italic>-phenyl-<italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine in acetone and dried in air yielding a thin, uniform, transparent coating on the surface. This fabric is then immersed in aqueous acid 1 M HCl containing ~1% <italic>N</italic>-phenyl-<italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine followed by the addition of ammonium peroxydisulfate oxidant. The solution turns green almost instantaneously yielding an emerald green coating of the hydrochloride-doped aniline tetramer on the fabric surface. This is accompanied by precipitation of copious amounts of aniline tetramer powder. The fabric is immersed in aqueous 1 M HCl to remove unreacted dimer and then washed with water and used as a substrate for aniline polymerization. The fabric is immersed in a solution of aniline in aqueous 1 M HCl, and polymerization is initiated on the tetramer-coated fabric by the addition of ammonium peroxydisulfate. This time, the reaction proceeds smoothly on the fabric surface yielding a very uniform and strongly adhering coating of conducting PANI nanofibers that was used for stress–strain–resistance measurements. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that the PANI coating is composed entirely of a 40- to 60-nm-diameter nonwoven mesh of nanofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12453959">Figure 4(b)</xref>).</p>

<title>PPY coatings</title>
<p>Electrically conducting PPY is synthesized by oxidative chemical polymerization of pyrrole using hydrogen peroxide, ferric chloride, or ammonium peroxydisulfate in aqueous or organic solvents. The reaction scheme using ammonium peroxydisulfate in dilute aqueous acids is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12453959">Figure 5(a)</xref>. However, PPY behaves similar to PANI in that very nonuniform coatings are obtained using conventional coating techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12453959">Oh et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, the hydrochloride-doped PPY powder is insoluble and intractable, which also rules out in situ, dip- or spray-coating approaches. The in situ adsorption polymerization mentioned above also yields inhomogeneous, thin, nonuniform coatings. Once again, the aniline dimer–seeded approach was used to overcome this issue. The fabric is first dipped in a dilute solution of <italic>N</italic>-phenyl-<italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine in aqueous acid (aniline dimer/1 M HCl) followed by the addition of ammonium peroxydisulfate. Similar to the reaction previously mentioned, the solution turns emerald green almost instantaneously yielding a coating of the hydrochloride-doped aniline tetramer on the fabric surface. The fabric is removed from the reaction vessel, washed with water and aqueous 1 M HCl, and dipped in a solution of pyrrole in aqueous HCl. Ammonium peroxydisulfate is added to initiate the polymerization of pyrrole on top of the exiting aniline tetramer coating on the fabric. This time, the reaction proceeds smoothly on the fabric surface yielding a black-colored coating of highly conducting PPY that was used for stress–strain–resistance measurements. The SEM image shows that the PPY coating is composed entirely of 70- to 100-nm-diameter globules of nanospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12453959">Figure 4(c)</xref>).</p>

<title>Single-walled CNT coatings</title>
<p>An aqueous surfactant-supported dispersion of CNT (microns long, 20–30 nm diameter) is prepared by probe sonicating ~10 mg of CNT bundles in a solution of the nonionic surfactant Triton-X100 in 10 mL of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12453959">Dua et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12453959">Saran et al., 2004</xref>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12453959">Figure 5(b)</xref>. The parachute fabric is then dipped in a freshly prepared dispersion for ~20 s and dried in air, and the procedure is repeated until a uniform coating is obtained. The fabric is then washed three times in toluene for ~15 s to remove residual Triton-X100, dried in air, and used for stress–strain–resistance measurements. In order to obtain strongly adhering CNT coatings, it is not necessary to synthesize an undercoating of aniline tetramer. An SEM image shows a nonwoven mesh of microns long, 20–40 nm diameter, bundles of CNT consistent with previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12453959">Saran et al., 2004</xref>), and the TEM) image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12453959">Figure 4(d)</xref>) shows that individual CNT bundles having a diameter of &lt;20 nm are also present on the fabric surface.</p>

<title>Equipment</title>
<p>The tensile testing experimental setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12453959">Figure 6</xref>. An Instron (Norwood, MA), testing machine (model 4464) was used to control the displacement and to measure the tensile load in the materials. A 100-N load cell was used for testing parachute fabrics, while a 2-kN load cell was used for testing suspension lines. Pneumatic grips were used to clamp the fabric samples in place (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12453959">Figure 6(b)</xref>). An externally mounted Omega LVDT (model LD620-25) measured the displacement of the Instron cross head. The linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) was powered by a 10 V input signal from a direct current (DC) power supply. A Wheatstone bridge circuit was used to measure the resistance of the conductive fabrics and suspension lines. The bridge circuit was powered by a 5 V input signal from another DC power supply. The Wheatstone bridge circuit is described in further detail in a subsequent section of the article. A computer equipped with LabVIEW and a National Instruments analog-to-digital converter was used to acquire the following signals of data: load cell (tensile load), LVDT (displacement—i.e., strain), Wheatstone bridge voltage output (sensor response), and input voltage from the DC power supply as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12453959">Figure 7</xref>. MATLAB was used to process the data and plot the results. A LabVIEW script automated the displacement of the Instron to ensure uniform displacements for all tensile tests. Furthermore, all wired connections were screwed into a junction plate to reduce movement during testing. Shielded Bayonet Neill–Concelman (BNC) cables were used to reduce cross talk between channels.</p>

<p>In this case, the measured resistance, R<sub>gauge</sub>, is the resistance through the conductive material. The measured voltage output of the Wheatstone bridge was used to calculate the measured resistance of the conductive materials using equation (1). To verify the accuracy of the analytical prediction of the measured sensor resistance, fixed resistors were measured through the R<sub>gauge</sub> position in the bridge. The fixed resistors (R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub>) within the Wheatstone bridge were changed to match the nominal resistance of the conductive samples to maximize the accuracy of the resistance measurement. Each configuration of the Wheatstone bridge was verified to contain no more than 0.5% error compared to the analytical solution (see equation (1)) within the range of interest.</p>

<title>Explanation of warp and weft terminology</title>
<p>Nylon parachute fabric is a woven material, which implies that it possesses direction-dependent material properties. The conductive parachute fabric was tested in two different orientations—<italic>warp</italic> and <italic>weft</italic>. The terms <italic>warp</italic> and <italic>weft</italic> are used to describe the weave pattern in a woven fabric. The warp threads are tensioned during the weaving process and provide most of the structure within the fabric, while the weft threads are woven between the warp threads to fill the gaps, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12453959">Figure 9(a)</xref>. The orientation of the conductive fabric samples as they were cut from a large sample and then tested uniaxially are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12453959">Figure 9(b)</xref>. Separate samples were tested for each orientation. It should be noted that the actual stresses and strains in the fabric are two-dimensional due to the complex interactions between the warp and weft fibers within the fabric.</p>

<title>Sensing performance of electrically conductive parachute fabrics</title>
<p>The following section of the article evaluates the sensing performance of the electrically conductive parachute fabrics. The goal of the tensile tests performed on the conductive fabrics was to determine a basic relationship between the resistance and tensile load or strain. A total of five conductive coatings were tested in the warp and weft orientations. The specimens were prepared with the same physical dimensions of 1 inch width by 6 inches length. The following subsections describe the tensile tests performed on the conductive fabrics and provide a summary of the best-performing samples.</p>

<title>Experimental results of failure tests</title>
<p>The ultimate tensile strength of each conductive parachute fabric was measured by testing samples of each coating to failure. These tests determined the effect of the conductive coatings on the ultimate strength of the parachute fabric. Multiple samples of each conductive coating were tested for repeatability. The loading profiles of each material in the warp and weft orientations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X12453959">Figure 10</xref>. The ultimate strength of each specimen is listed next to the corresponding loading curve. The ultimate strength and strain of the coated parachute fabrics are reduced relative to the uncoated parachute fabric.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045389X12453959">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of the ultimate strength for each conductive fabric. For coatings with multiple samples tested, the sample with the lowest ultimate strength was listed. The ultimate strength of the parachute fabric is significantly reduced when coated with the conductive coatings. Incorporating CNT with the conductive coatings of PANI and PPY was expected to improve the strength of the fabrics because of the inherent strength of the CNT. The results demonstrate an improvement in ultimate strength by adding CNT to the PPY coating, but not the PANI coating, although the ultimate strength is still less than the uncoated fabric. This suggests that the coating process may have more of an effect on the strength of the fabric than the conductive coatings themselves. For example, the high acidity of the ~1.0 M HCl solution and the harsh oxidant, such as ammonium peroxydisulfate used during the deposition of PANI and PPY coating could have caused hydrolytic damage to the nylon fabric. In the case of CNT, the authors believe the damage could be caused when the fabric is bath sonicated in toluene to remove excess surfactant from the dispersion used. It is believed that both these issues can be resolved in the future, for example, by carrying out the polymerization under near-neutral conditions and by employing greener, softer oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12453959">Surwade et al., 2009a</xref>). In the case of CNT, the authors believe a change in solvent from toluene to ethanol or ethylacetate should mitigate loss in ultimate strength during the sonication step.</p>

<title>Experimental results of quasi-static tests</title>
<p>The resistance response of each conductive fabric was measured by testing samples of each coating under quasi-static loading conditions. These tests examined the stress–relaxation behavior of the conductive fabrics as well as their ability to monitor changes in tensile load or strain in the parachute fabric. The results of the quasi-static tensile test on the coating of PPY and CNT in the warp and weft orientations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X12453959">Figure 11</xref>. The resistance change is plotted relative to tensile load and strain in the warp and weft orientation, and a unique least-square linear regression line was applied to each of the four subplots. The nominal resistance of the sample is listed in the legend, along with the linear regression coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>). The resistance measurements from the test provide insight into the behavior of the conductive coating of the parachute fabric. The change in resistance relative to tensile load and strain in the warp orientation could be approximated as a linear relationship. Nonlinear regions exist at low strain and tensile load values, especially in the weft orientation. The nonlinearity in the weft orientation is likely due to the realignment of the weft fibers within the parachute fabric as it is strained axially.</p>

<p>The subplots on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X12453959">Figure 11</xref> show the tensile load, strain, and resistance measurements plotted relative to time, while the subplots on the right side show the resistance plotted relative to tensile load and strain. The stress–relaxation behavior of the nylon parachute fabric is evident in the loading profiles when the strain is held at a constant value. Furthermore, the tensile load is almost twice as high in the warp orientation as the weft orientation at the same strain values. The resistance response is highly dependent on the orientation of specimen; the resistance correlation coefficients relative to tensile load and strain are significantly higher in the warp orientation than the weft orientation. There is hysteresis between the strain increments in both orientations. The resistance correlations with tensile load and strain in the warp orientation are the highest of all the conductive coatings. It is to be noted that although the PANI coating shows a consistently high correlation value in the warp direction, this material was not pursued further because of its potential to dedope readily when exposed to water (realistic conditions). For example, unlike other conducting polymers (and CNT), the protons in PANI are highly acidic and are susceptible to deprotonation under high moisture conditions, leading to a steady loss of conductivity. Based on the results of the quasi-static tests as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045389X12453959">Table 2</xref>, the coating of CNTs demonstrates the highest linear regression between resistance and tensile load and strain in the weft orientation.</p>

<title>Experimental results of dynamic tests</title>
<p>The resistance response of each conductive fabric was also measured under dynamic loading conditions. These tests examined the stress–relaxation behavior of the conductive fabrics over a larger number of loading cycles (approximately 360 cycles per test). The results of the dynamic tensile test on the coating of PPY and CNT in the warp and weft orientations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1045389X12453959">Figure 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1045389X12453959">Table 3</xref>. The hysteretic behavior of the nylon fabric is evident in the loading profiles and the resistance response. The tensile load decreases with each cycle. Furthermore, the resistance response does not approach repeatable behavior by the end of the dynamic test. The resistance correlations in both orientations are relatively low compared to the quasi-static results. The dynamic resistance correlations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1045389X12453959">Figure 12</xref> are significantly lower than the quasi-static correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X12453959">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045389X12453959">Table 2</xref>). The hysteretic behavior in the conductive fabrics is more pronounced in the dynamic test results. The resistance behavior may achieve a normalized relationship with either tensile load or strain when subjected to a higher number of loading cycles.</p>

<p>All five samples mentioned above were tested in weft and warp orientations. The fabrics coated with only CNTs show better sensing performance in the weft orientation, that is, linear regression coefficient with respect to load versus resistance in weft orientation under quasi-static condition is 0.756 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045389X12453959">Table 2</xref>). However, there is a sharp drop in performance in the warp orientation, with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.130, which could be attributed to the alignment of CNT in one direction. The overall performance is poor under dynamic testing for all coating except PANI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1045389X12453959">Table 3</xref>). Surprisingly, the PANI coating shows stable linear regression coefficients in both directions (weft and warp) under quasi-static and dynamic testing. PANI has shown the highest linear regression coefficient with respect to load versus resistance in both the weft and warp orientations under dynamic testing. The reason for this behavior may be attributed to the nanofibrillar morphology of PANI as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12453959">Figure 4(b)</xref>, the nanofibers are entangled uniformly on the both warp and weft fibers. However, as mentioned earlier, the authors did not pursue this in view of the susceptibility of PANI films to dedoping (loss of conductivity) when exposed to water. It is possible that this issue could be overcome by using self-doped PANI, that is, PANI where the dopant is covalently attached to the polymer backbone, which maintains high conductivity under neutral conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045389X12453959">Yu et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimental results of conditioning tests</title>
<p>The long-term resistance response of several conductive fabrics was measured under repeated quasi-static and dynamic loading. These conditioning tests examined the resistance behavior of the conductive fabrics over a large number of loading cycles to determine if the resistance response would reach a normalized relationship with either tensile load or strain. The first conditioning test was primarily quasi-static loading cycles, while the second test was primarily dynamic loading cycles. The samples were only tested in the warp orientation. A single sample was used for each conditioning test.</p>
<p>The results of the first conditioning tensile test (3 static + 1 dynamic + 1 static) on the coating of PPY and CNT in the warp orientation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12453959">Figure 13</xref>. It is apparent that with each successive loading cycle, the resistance continues to increase without returning to the nominal value. The linear regression correlations between resistance and tensile load and strain from the first conditioning tensile test on the coating of PPY and CNT are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12453959">Figure 13</xref>. The first three quasi-static loading cycles show improvements in the resistance correlations with each cycle, but the quasi-static response decreases significantly after the dynamic loading cycle. The results of the second conditioning tensile test (3 dynamic + 1 static + 1 dynamic) on the coating of PPY and CNT in the warp orientation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1045389X12453959">Figure 14</xref>. Similar to the first conditioning test, the resistance continues to increase with each successive loading cycle. The resistance response during the dynamic loading cycles appears to reach a repeatable pattern after the first cycle. The linear regression correlations between resistance and tensile load and strain from the second conditioning tensile test on the coating of PPY and CNT are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1045389X12453959">Figure 14</xref>. The resistance correlations improve with each successive loading cycle. The strain–resistance correlation of the quasi-static cycle in test 2 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.893) is higher than any corresponding correlation from the first conditioning test (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.824, 0.807, 0.754, and 0.686 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12453959">Figure 13</xref>), suggesting that subjecting freshly coated fabrics to repeated dynamic loading improves the sensing performance of the fabrics. This is to be contrasted with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12453959">Figure 13</xref>, where sensor performance decreases after subjecting freshly coated fabrics to repeated quasi-static loadings followed by dynamic loading. Additional tests are required to fully understand the role of preconditioning (quasi-static vs. dynamic loading) on sensing performance.</p>

<title>Summary assessment of sensing performance of conductive parachute fabrics</title>
<p>The conductive parachute fabrics demonstrated potential to be used as tensile load or strain sensors. There is significant hysteresis in the resistance response of the conductive fabrics, particularly under dynamic loading conditions. The linear regression coefficients were relatively high for the resistance response relative to strain in the warp orientation under quasi-static loading conditions. The complexity of the weave pattern in the parachute fabrics degraded the linearity of the resistance response during uniaxial testing. As the fabric is strained uniaxially, there is complex sheering behavior in the warp and weft fibers within the fabric. Because of the weave pattern in the fabric, the warp fibers are aligned axially and thus demonstrate more linear performance. The weft fibers are woven more loosely between the warp fibers and realign as the fabric is strained axially. This explains why the resistance initially increases when strained in the warp orientation, and the resistance changes nonlinearly for the first 5%–10% strain in the weft orientation. The above results show that under quasi-static conditions, the PANI, PPY, and CNT coatings show high resistance correlation to strain in the warp orientation. Under dynamic conditions, however, hysteresis significantly hinders the effectiveness of the resistance measurements for correlation to either tensile load or strain. For example, PANI shows good correlation between load and change in resistance. However, over time, the sample becomes deprotonated (resistance increases with respect to time) so no further studies were conducted on fabrics coated with PANI. The PPY- and CNT-coated samples exhibited the best resistance to load correlations for a single static test but upon conditioning, that is, testing over extended durations under quasi-static conditions, the fabric’s sensing performance decreased. Surprisingly, conditioning of the fabric under a mix of dynamic, static, and dynamic conditions as opposed to quasi-static conditions, actually improved the sensing performance of the PPY- and CNT-coated fabric. Despite the sensing potential, the fabrication procedure used to obtain conductive coatings reduces the ultimate strength of the parachute fabrics by approximately 15%–30%.</p>

<title>Sensing performance of conductive suspension lines</title>
<p>The following section of the article evaluates the sensing performance of the electrically conductive parachute suspension lines. The goal of these tensile tests was the same as the conductive fabrics—determine a basic relationship between the resistance and strain or tensile load. A total of five conductive coatings were tested. All tests were performed on PIA-C-5040, type III parachute suspension lines. The results of an extended conditioning tensile test (12 loading cycles including: 3 static + 1 dynamic + 1 static + 1 dynamic + 3 static + 1 dynamic + 1 static + 1 dynamic) on the suspension line coated with PPY and CNT are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X12453959">Figure 15</xref>. The resistance follows a consistent pattern of response during the quasi-static and dynamic loading cycles following the 120-min mark.</p>
<p>The linear regression correlations between resistance and tensile load and strain from the conditioning tensile test are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X12453959">Figure 15</xref> for the 12 loading cycles. The linear resistance regressions improve with each successive loading cycle. Although hysteresis still exists in the resistance response, it is moderate compared to the conductive fabrics. The conductive parachute suspension lines show improved sensing potential compared to the conductive parachute fabrics. There is still hysteresis in the resistance response, particularly under dynamic loading conditions, due to the mechanical properties of nylon. Yet, the hysteresis is reduced compared to the resistance behavior observed in conductive fabrics. It is likely that the uniaxial nature of the suspension lines improved the resistance correlations.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1045389X12453959">Figure 16</xref> also shows the strain–resistance and load–resistance regression coefficients of each coating relative to the loading cycle (for the first 6 of 12). The correlation values increase with each loading cycle through the first three quasi-static cycles (1–3). The correlation values also increase from the first dynamic loading cycle (4) to the second dynamic loading cycle (6). Of the five coatings, the PPY with CNT demonstrate the highest linear correlation values, especially under the dynamic loading cycles (4 and 6). On average, the linear correlation between resistance and strain is stronger than that of resistance and tensile load. Other than the coatings of CNT and PANI with CNT, the coatings performed equally well under quasi-static loading. The ultimate strength of the conductive parachute suspension lines was not measured.</p>

<p>The smart materials presented in this article demonstrate the ability to correlate mechanical strain and loading with a change in electrical resistance. The authors described a new synthetic method to obtain uniform conducting polymer coatings on commercial parachute fabrics by synthesizing aniline tetramer in situ from aniline dimer as an undercoating. Coated conductive suspension lines exhibited high linear resistance correlations with tensile load and strain, although the correlations of the conductive fabrics are adequate for a low resolution sensor. Hysteresis exists in all measurements of both materials but is prominent when measuring the response under dynamic loading conditions. Despite the sensing potential, the coating method decreases the ultimate strength of the parachute fabrics by approximately 15%–30%. Similar reduction in ultimate strength is expected for the conductive suspension lines, though tests results would be needed for validation. The main advantage of these smart materials is that they are embedded in the parachute materials. It may be possible to develop an integrated sensor network distributed throughout the parachute canopy and along the suspension lines of a parachute system. These sensors could provide useful feedback, such as maximum tensile loads or strains, to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the parachute system was not compromised during an airdrop mission.</p>

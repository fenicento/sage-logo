<abstract>
<p>The importance of susceptibility genes in the risk for dental caries has been clearly established. While many candidate caries genes have been proposed, to date, few of them have been rigorously validated through observational and experimental studies. Moreover, most genetic epidemiological studies have analyzed global caries phenotypes that ignore the possibility that genes may exert differential effects across tooth surfaces of the dentition. Therefore, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 5 novel dental caries phenotypes (developed by clustering the permanent dentition into categories of tooth surfaces based on co-occurrence of caries) to nominate new candidate caries genes. GWAS was performed in 920 self-reported white participants, aged 18 to 75 years, with genotype data on 518,997 genetic variants. We identified a significant genetic association between dental caries of the anterior mandibular teeth and <italic>LYZL2</italic> (p value = 9e-9), which codes a bacteriolytic agent thought to be involved in host defense. We also identified a significant genetic association between caries of the mid- dentition tooth surfaces and <italic>AJAP1</italic> (p value = 2e-8), a gene possibly involved in tooth development. Suggestive genetic associations were also observed for <italic>ABCG2, PKD2</italic>, the dentin/bone <italic>SCPP</italic> sub-family, <italic>EDNRA, TJFBR1, NKX2-3, IFT88, TWSG1, IL17D</italic>, and <italic>SMAD7</italic> (p values &lt; 7e-6). We nominate these novel genes for future study.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental caries is the most common chronic disease worldwide and affects approximately 90% of adults in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512463579">Beltran-Aguilar <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Many factors contribute to disease, including environmental, endogenous, and behavioral factors such as diet, bacterial flora, fluoride exposures, oral hygiene, salivary flow and composition, morphological and positional characteristics of the dentition, host immune response, and preventive interventions. Genes and gene-by-environmental interactions are widely acknowledged to contribute to caries susceptibility through mechanisms affecting these and other unknown risk factors. The heritability of dental caries is high (30-55%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512463579">Boraas <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2012a</xref>), and previous studies, including a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) have sought to identify the specific genetic factors involved. However, to date, the causal roles of caries genes have not been rigorously established. The vast majority of genetic variants affecting disease remain unknown.</p>
<p>To date, a potential limitation of most genetic epidemiological studies of dental caries is the global phenotype definition. Most genetics studies have used a single measure of decay, such as a binary (yes/no) affection status or the DMFT/S index (calculated as the sum of decayed, missing due to decay, or filled/restored teeth/surfaces). As global measures of decay, phenotypes such as these ignore the fact that tooth surfaces across the dentition exhibit differences in susceptibility to dental caries and are differentially affected by risk factors. By ignoring the patterns of decay, global caries measures may be poor phenotypes for identifying genetic variants affecting dental caries, which are likely to exert individually weak and differential effects across the various surfaces of the permanent dentition. In a related study presented in this issue of the <italic>Journal</italic>, we describe the use of hierarchical clustering to generate novel caries phenotypes that capture the non-uniform risk of caries across tooth surfaces of the dentition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). In this study, we performed GWAS for these novel dental caries phenotypes to nominate candidate caries genes for future observational and experimental studies.</p>

<title>Sample Recruitment</title>
<p>The sample was recruited as part of an initiative by the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (COHRA) to study the factors affecting oral health in a rural, underserved population. Details regarding recruitment and data collection for this sample have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512463579">Polk <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and are summarized in a separate article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Nine hundred twenty self-reported whites, aged 18 to 75 yrs, with dental caries assessments and genome-wide genotype data were included in this study.</p>

<title>Novel Caries Phenotypes</title>
<p>To study the genetic factors influencing dental caries, which we hypothesized may exert differential effects across tooth surfaces of the permanent dentition, we first developed novel caries phenotypes that capture the patterns of decay. Development of these novel phenotypes is fully described in a separate article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). In summary, we used hierarchical clustering to group tooth surfaces based on co-occurrence of dental caries. We hypothesized that tooth surfaces that co-vary with respect to dental caries may be similarly influenced by genetic risk factors. Cluster analysis yielded 5 stable clusters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512463579">Table 1</xref>), one of which, the mid-dentition surfaces, could be further partitioned into sub-clusters comprised of maxillary and mandibular tooth surfaces. For each cluster (or sub-cluster), we generated the “partial DMFS index”, which is the count of carious surfaces (<italic>i.e.</italic>, non-cavitated or cavitated decay, missing due to decay, or restored) for a given cluster. We denote these novel phenotypes as DMFS1, DMFS2, DMFS3, DMFS4, and DMFS5 (which is sub-divided into DMFS5<sub>max</sub> and DMFS5<sub>mand</sub>).</p>

<title>Genotyping</title>
<p>Genotyping was performed at the Center of Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) of Johns Hopkins University. Data cleaning and quality assurance procedures were conducted in conjunction with the CIDR data cleaning center at the University of Washington. The Illumina Human610-Quadv1_B BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and Illumina Infinium II assay protocol were used. In general, genotyping quality was excellent; 518,997 genetic markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) passing quality control and analysis filters (participant call rates &gt; 90%; SNP call rates &gt; 99%; Hardy-Weinberg p values &gt; 0.0001; minor allele frequency &gt; 0.02) were analyzed in this study. Details regarding genotyping and data cleaning are publicly available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genevastudy.org">www.genevastudy.org</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>GWAS were performed for each heritable dental caries phenotype (<italic>i.e.</italic>, DMFS2, DMFS3, DMFS5, DMFS5<sub>max</sub>, DMFS5<sub>mand</sub>). Genetic association for each of the 518,997 SNPs was tested by linear regression in PLINK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512463579">Purcell <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), adjusted for the effects of sex, age, and age<sup>2</sup>. The genomic inflation factor, λ, and Manhattan plots were generated in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, AU). Given the issue of multiple comparisons, conservative p value thresholds for statistical significance were set equal to 5e-8 after adjustment for genomic inflation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, p ≤ 10<sup>−7.3λ</sup>). The p value thresholds for suggestive significance were set equal to 1e-5 after adjustment for genomic inflation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, p ≤ 10<sup>−5λ</sup>). Under the GWAS approach, associated markers are not expected to be causal, but are assumed to be physically proximal and in linkage disequilibrium (<italic>i.e.</italic>, correlated due to ancestry) with unobserved causal variants. Moreover, where a causal variant may be situated with respect to the gene it influences is currently unknown, but, typically, is thought to be also physically proximal. Therefore, we explored and report the known biological functions of genes near our significant and suggestive hits for plausible roles in dental caries.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The study sample included 920 self-reported whites, aged 18 to 75 yrs, with available data for caries phenotypes, covariates (<italic>i.e.</italic>, age, age<sup>2</sup>, and sex), and genetic markers. Novel dental caries phenotypes reflecting decay in different categories of tooth surfaces were generated by cluster analysis. A separate article describes the development and heritability estimation of the phenotypes used herein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Descriptive statistics for novel caries phenotypes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512463579">Table 1</xref>. The genomic inflation factor (λ) ranged from 1.00 to 1.05, indicating minimal to minor inflation of p values compared with that expected by chance alone. Thresholds for genome-wide and suggestive statistical significance were adjusted for the genomic inflation factor observed for each GWAS. Manhattan plots illustrating the GWAS results for the 5 heritable dental caries phenotypes (<italic>i.e</italic>., DMFS2, DMFS3, DMFS5, DMFS5<sub>max</sub>, and DMFS5<sub>mand</sub>) are shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512463579">Fig</xref>.</p>

<p>Two loci exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034512463579">Table 2</xref>). The most significant association that we observed was for DMFS2 (mandibular anterior tooth surfaces) and <italic>LYZL2</italic> on chromosome 10p11.23 (rs399593; p value = 9.4e-9). Though very little is known about <italic>LYZL2</italic> specifically, it belongs to the family of c-type lysosomes, which are well-recognized bacteriolytic factors of host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512463579">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). It is currently unknown whether <italic>LYZL2</italic> affects dental caries, although its putative antibacterial function suggests a biologically plausible mechanism through which <italic>LYZL2</italic> may influence cariogenesis. The second most significant association that we observed was for DMFS5<sub>max</sub> and the upstream un-translated region of <italic>AJAP1</italic> on chromosome 1p (rs3896439; p value = 2.4e-8). The protein product of <italic>AJAP1</italic>, SHREW1, interacts with basigin, a mediator of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512463579">Schreiner <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) involved in tooth development in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512463579">Schwab <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512463579">Kumamoto and Ooya, 2006</xref>). This association was also observed for DMFS5 at the suggestive level of significance (rs3896439; p value = 1.1e-6). Likewise, associated genetic variants upstream of <italic>AJAP1</italic> were among the top hits in an independent GWAS of dental caries in COHRA children (unpublished observations).

<p>In addition to the 2 genome-wide significant associations described above, we also observed several suggestive association signals. The strongest of these was observed for DMFS5<sub>mand</sub> and a locus on chromosome 4q22.1 harboring several tooth-related genes. The top SNP in this region (rs3114018; p value = 7.478e-8) was in <italic>ABCG2</italic>, a transporter protein and stem-cell marker expressed in human dental pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512463579">Honda <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and in developing mouse incisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512463579">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).

The adjacent gene, <italic>PKD2</italic>, has also been implicated in craniofacial development: <italic>PKD2</italic> mutations in mice cause dental loss, root fractures, and other craniofacial anomalies, and are associated with facial asymmetry in humans (Khonsari; unpublished observations presented at IADR 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2012rio/webprogram/Paper160464">http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2012rio/webprogram/Paper160464</ext-link>). The associated locus also includes the 5 paralogous genes of the dentin/bone <italic>SCPP</italic> sub-family (<italic>i.e., SPP1, MEPE, IBSP, DMP1</italic>, and <italic>DSPP</italic>), which are extracellular matrix proteins involved in tooth (and bone) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512463579">Kawasaki and Weiss, 2008</xref>). Genetic variation at this locus may affect one or more of these genes related to tooth development, which, in turn, may affect susceptibility to dental caries.</p>
<p>Many additional suggestive associations were observed, including several in or near genes with biologically plausible roles in caries susceptibility, as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034512463579">Table 2</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dental caries is an extremely multi-factorial disease, whereby genes operating through numerous biological avenues may influence susceptibility. In this study, we performed genome-wide association scans for novel dental caries phenotypes developed under the hypothesis that genetic variants (as is the case with environmental risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>]) may differentially affect caries risk across tooth surfaces of the permanent dentition. Two genome-wide significant loci were observed: <italic>LYZL2</italic> for mandibular anterior surfaces (<italic>i.e</italic>., surfaces of the incisors, canines, and premolars), and <italic>AJAP1</italic> for mid-dentition surfaces (<italic>i.e</italic>., surfaces of the premolars and maxillary canines). Numerous suggestive loci were also observed.</p>
<p>A theme among the associated loci was genes thought to be involved in craniofacial, salivary gland, and tooth development, including <italic>AJAP1, ABCG2, PKD2</italic>, the dentin/bone <italic>SCPP</italic> sub-family, <italic>EDNRA, TJFBR1, NKX2-3, IFT88, TWSG1</italic>, and <italic>SMAD7</italic>. Developmental genes such as these add to the growing list of host genes, including taste preference, enamel-related, and bactericidal genes, that have been chosen for investigation. In light of the observational study design, we cautiously interpret our results to nominate these loci as putative caries genes, pending confirmation in additional epidemiological and experimental studies. More work, including functional studies, will be required to determine whether associated loci may be useful for disease prediction, diagnosis, or treatment. Either way, the novel associations identified here may lead to better understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cariogenesis.</p>
<p>For the most part, the significant and suggestive associations identified in this study did not overlap with loci identified <italic>via</italic> GWAS of global caries phenotypes of the permanent dentition in this sample (unpublished observations) or global phenotypes of the primary dentition in a related sample of children from the same population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). This observation suggests that data-driven caries phenotypes that attempt to capture biologically informative patterns of tooth decay, such as those generated for this study, may be useful for identifying and understanding the genetic contributions to dental caries. Indeed, the X-linked association between DMFS5 and <italic>BCORL1</italic> was also observed in a GWAS of smooth-surface caries, a similar caries phenotype defined based on <italic>a priori</italic> tooth-surface classifications (unpublished observations).</p>
<p>In the interpretation of our results, a few design aspects of the GWAS approach warrant discussion. First, we view GWAS as a discovery-driven approach, with the goal of generating new hypotheses (as opposed to the paradigm of testing hypotheses). Therefore, in addition to scrutinizing our genome-wide significant hits (which met a very strict significance threshold, even considering the multiple testing), we also examined and report suggestive associations. While the genome-wide significant associations are extremely unlikely to occur by chance alone, associations meeting suggestive significance may occur by chance (though likely not as many as we observed). Therefore, we expect that some of the suggestive associations observed in this study may be spurious, whereas others are likely true reflections of genetic risk. Ideally, these associations should be replicated in an independent sample; however, we analyzed novel caries phenotypes developed specifically for this GWAS from tooth-surface-level caries data not currently available in any other adult sample. Therefore, replication in an independent sample is not currently possible. This limitation is partly countered by the corroborating evidence of gene functions connecting many of our associated loci to tooth-related biological processes. In short, many of our associations make sense, and therefore, we propose prioritizing them among the growing list of caries candidate genes. Additional work is needed to explore the independent or interacting effects of these candidate genes with known environmental risk factors, such as fluoride exposures, dietary and oral hygiene behaviors, and demographics.</p>
<p>A major strength and innovation of this study was the use of novel caries phenotypes, which were developed by hierarchical clustering analysis on tooth-surface-level data. We have previously shown that grouping surfaces based on co-occurrence of caries resulted in sensible categories, which were reproducible in NHANES 1999-2000, an independent national cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Some of the novel caries phenotypes were heritable and/or exhibited significant correlations with putative environmental predictors such as age, sex, educational attainment, and toothbrushing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512463579">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Here, we showed that these novel caries outcomes were also useful for identifying genetic loci, which may exert differential effects across categories of tooth surfaces. For example, bacteriolytic <italic>LYZL2</italic> and pro-inflammatory <italic>IL17D</italic>, both genes involved in host response to bacterial infection, were implicated in DMFS2, which reflects caries of the mandibular anterior tooth surfaces (<italic>i.e.</italic>, incisors, canines, and first premolars). These surfaces are similar in their positions in the mouth and their comparatively low prevalence of caries. In contrast, several tooth development genes were implicated for DMFS5 (and sub-clusters DMFS5<sub>max</sub> and DMFS5<sub>mand</sub>), reflecting caries of the mid-dentition surfaces (<italic>i.e.</italic>, pre-molars and canines, which exhibit moderate caries prevalence). DMFS3, which reflects posterior surfaces excluding the molar pit and fissure surfaces, showed associations with a number of genetic loci, though no obvious candidate genes were identified. In contrast, DMFS1 (reflecting molar pit and fissure surfaces, which exhibit the greatest caries prevalence) and DMFS4 (reflecting maxillary incisors, which exhibit moderate caries prevalence) were not significantly heritable, and therefore, GWAS for these outcomes were not considered. These two categories of tooth surfaces are likely strongly influenced by important environmental factors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, sealants and dietary choices) that may render them less informative for discovering genetic risk factors. Overall, we take these results to support our premise that susceptibility genes exert their effects differentially across the permanent dentition and that modeling tooth-surface-level caries data can benefit gene-mapping efforts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified many novel genetic associations for dental caries and nominated several new caries genes. Moreover, we observed that different genetic variants were associated with caries across the different categories of tooth surfaces, which supports our central hypothesis. This study demonstrated the utility of novel dental caries phenotypes for identifying genetic risk factors, which we believe may prove useful for understanding the biological mechanisms predisposing to dental caries, and, ultimately, may lead to improvements in disease prevention, detection, and treatment.</p>

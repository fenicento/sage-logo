<abstract>
<p>This paper describes how risk-based risk control allocation models work on pressure vessels and piping. We begin by discussing the economic rationale for allocating risk control in a diversified organization such as an enterprise. Considering a probability model for risk control decision making under uncertainty and risk, we propose a model involving stochastic total-loss amount constraints with respect to various tolerable default levels. Our main objective is to develop a method that would allow shaping the risk associated with risk control outcomes. The direct and indirect losses caused by the simulated disasters can be estimated using the engineering and financial analysis model. Based on this model, we can generate an exceeding probability (EP) curve and then calculate how much loss will be eliminated or transferred to other entities should funds be allocated to risk control. Optimal natural disaster risk control arrangement with probabilistic formulation is explained in this paper. Results from the proposed formulations are compared in case studies. The model attempts to apply risk based budget guidelines to risk reduction measurement within a portfolio-based risk framework.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1077546311403182"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Conventional deterministic cost-benefit calculation cannot reflect enterprise applicability of risk financing technology by which victims and enterprises can reduce their probability of damages. In addition, from a corporate accounting perspective, the deterministic model is a conceptual abstraction but cannot illustrate corporate value at risk. The stochastic cost-benefit-risk analysis model is more suited to achieving the three equivalent goals of natural disaster risk management; i.e., maximizing shareholder wealth, share price, and firm value.</p>
<p>It is argued that the risk control budgeting process can be described as the procedure in which risk control measures are allocated with the objective of mitigating the risks of operation and financing. Viewing the risk control budgeting process in this way is useful because it suggests a risk control measure contribution to the overall vulnerability of properties. Business operation of enterprises is an important factor in evaluating the effects of (and the budget allocated to) a specific risk control measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311403182">Du and Chen, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Probabilistic risk control arrangement is based on the earthquake risk assessment model and emphasizes tolerable risk of a design by ensuring probabilistic constraint satisfaction at desired levels. Synthesis (optimization) is then performed under uncertainty to achieve the design objective by managing the effects of uncertainty on arrangement output (arrangement performance).</p>
<p>In spite of the benefits of probabilistic arrangement, one of the most challenging issues surrounding its implementation is associated with the intensive computational demand of uncertainty analysis. To capture the probabilistic characteristics of arrangement performance at a design point, we must perform a number of analyses around the nominal point using a simulation approach (for instance, Monte Carlo simulation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311403182">Melchers, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The proposed model allocates risk control budget for two basic reasons: (1) enterprise default risk management, and (2) risk reduction performance evaluation. For risk-management purposes, the overriding goal of allocating budget to individual risk control measures is to determine an enterprise's optimal property risk structure. This process involves estimating how much the risk (volatility) of each risk control measure contributes to the total risk of an enterprise, and, hence, to an enterprise's overall budget requirements.</p>
<p>For performance-evaluation purposes, the model assigns funds to risk control measures as part of a process of determining the risk-adjusted value of property, and ultimately, the degree risk reduction of each risk control measure. The net risk reduction of each risk control measure (RCM) is defined simply as the risk control measure's adjusted damage loss less a risk control measure charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311403182">James, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The objective in this case is to measure a risk control measure's contribution to shareholder value, and thus to provide a basis for effective risk control budgeting and incentive compensation at each risk control measure level.</p>
<p>Our focus in this study is to develop an efficient probabilistic arrangement approach to facilitate design optimizations that involve probabilistic constraints. Financial risk tolerance design is one such type of probabilistic optimization problem in which design feasibility is formulated as risk tolerance and cost constraints (or the probability of constraint satisfaction).</p>
<p>Even though the improved uncertainty analysis techniques and modifications of problem formulation have led to improved efficiency of probabilistic optimization, the improvement is quite limited due to the nature of optimal natural disaster risk control strategy.

<sec id="sec2-1077546311403182"><title>2. Probabilistic earthquake loss assessment</title>
<p>The design strategy of risk control for each natural disaster was determined based on the loss exceeding probability (EP) and the aggregate exceeding probability (AEP) curve, which was calculated in accordance with the economic effects related to disaster prevention. The value of decreased risk in expected annual damage (annual benefit) was calculated using the EP and AEP curves, and was compared with the costs necessary for risk control and analyzed with respect to its economic effects. Generally, the earthquake loss assessment procedure can be described by the diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311403182">Figure 2</xref>. Earthquakes can trigger several sorts of perilous phenomena. In this section, our earthquake loss assessment procedure only covers the red-dash line frame area. In other words, we focus on how to assess the damage to buildings due to ground shaking, and the losses incurred, including direct loss and indirect loss. There are four primary components within the earthquake loss assessment and management model. (1) A stochastic earthquake event generator, which uses a collection of relevant inventory and analysis parameters for the development of seismic damage assessment and loss estimation. (2) A hazard analysis procedure that can assess the intensity of ground shaking and maximum surface acceleration with the attenuation function dependent upon Taiwan's soil conditions. (3) A vulnerability analysis procedure that can compute the probability of different types of damage to structures. (4) A financial analysis procedure that can calculate losses, including direct and indirect economic losses. It can also provide the loss exceeding probability curve and dynamic financial analysis result. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311403182">Figure 3</xref> is an earthquake loss assessment methodology diagram that illustrates the whole procedure. The following sections introduce how the primary components work in detail.
<fig id="fig2-1077546311403182" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Exceeding probability curves of factory B built according to 1974, 1982 and 1999 Taiwan Building Codes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311403182-fig2.tif"/></fig>

<sec id="sec3-1077546311403182"><title>3. Stochastic earthquake event generator</title>
<p>A representative earthquake event set is important to an event-based earthquake model. For this reason, the historical distribution of the epicenters of earthquakes in Taiwan between 1900 and 2004 have been collected from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. This includes 43 seismic zones, 21 shallow seismic sources, seven deep seismic sources, and 15 subduction zone seismic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311403182">Cheng, 2002</xref>). There are also 42 active faults in the event generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311403182">Taiwan Central Geological Survey, MOEA 2000</xref>). The rate of occurrence of different magnitude events is estimated based on a Gutenberg-Richter (exponential) frequency-magnitude relationship. The earthquake occurrence rate is modeled by the Poisson model. There are 18,852 hypothetical earthquake events distributed across all sources in the generator, and each event includes the parameters required by the other analysis procedure, such as location, depth, magnitude, occurrence rate, and rupture direction.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1077546311403182"><title>4. Hazard analysis procedure</title>
<p>To asses the intensity of ground shaking for each simulated earthquake event is the purpose of the hazard analysis procedure. As described in the following diagram, we can calculate the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) or spectral acceleration for the location of a building.</p>
<p>In the Hazard Analysis Procedure, all crustal sources use the attenuation developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311403182">Loh (2000)</xref>, while the subduction sources use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311403182">Young et al. (1997)</xref>. For the siteeffect, we also consider the soil classifications of rock, weak rock/dense soil, stiff soil, and soft soil. Asoil map is inferred from an analysis of records of Free-field Strong-Motion Stations of the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau and a Geologic Map from the Taiwan Central Geological Survey, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Geotechnical data is derived fromgeologic maps published by the Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs at 1:50,000 and 1:250,000 resolutions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1077546311403182"><title>5. Vulnerability analysis procedure</title>
<p>According to the result of the hazard analysis procedure, we can obtain the demand curve. Then, using the Capacity Spectrum Method described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311403182">Figure 4</xref>, a specific group of (Sd, Sa) can be determined. Finally, we can obtain the probability of each damage state a building may experience. To calculate the mean damage ratio and relative coefficient of variation to buildings, contents, and the resulting loss of use, the following factors are considered: construction classes; occupancy classes; year of construction, number of stories, and seismic codes.
<fig id="fig4-1077546311403182" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Exceeding probability curves of factory B under several insurance policy conditions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311403182-fig4.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1077546311403182"><title>6. Financial analysis procedure</title>
<p>Before beginning the financial analysis, we must build the event loss table using the procedures described above. Based on the above modules, the modeler can construct an annual exceeding probability curve which relates probability to size of loss, and allows for the evaluation of an insurance and reinsurance program.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1077546311403182"><title>7. Tolerable ruin probability</title>
<p>Natural disaster risk can be measured along two dimensions – an enterprise's expected loss and probability of ruin. In the case of natural disaster risk, expected losses are reflected in annual average building damage loss and business interruption. Expected loss is the average rate of loss expected from the portfolio of an entire enterprise. It is probability of ruin that creates the need for extra capital or risk control measures.</p>
<p>In well-functioning markets, enterprises that experience natural disasters, economic, or financial distress are generally subject to the harsh discipline of customers, suppliers, and investors. The expected costs of economic and financial distress provide strong incentives for firms to establish socially desirable target levels of financial strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311403182">Wu et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Because decreasing risk is costly, beyond some minimum threshold of financial strength, prices increase with the level of an enterprise's rating because it is more costly for the enterprise to provide coverage with a lower risk of default (e.g., holding more capital is costly due to increased tax and agency costs). Market discipline encourages enterprises to desire relatively high levels of financial strength and thus high ratings. This is because financial strength protects firm-specific assets and helps the enterprise attract customers who value low risk of insolvency and who are therefore willing to pay the price of uninterrupted business service. Hence, unintended deterioration in the enterprise's business operations and financial rating will have one of two effects. It could alter the enterprise's target rating, or it could induce the enterprise to take risk control actions to resume its target rating. The enterprise wishes to resume its previous rating in order to preserve firm specific assets and avoid losing customers concerned with quality; so it will readily take RCMs to ensure their ratings. As a result, ratings upgrades are likely to reflect movement by enterprises to higher target levels of business safety.</p>
<p>Setting a risk tolerance value at a risk confidence level or a target default probability associated with a rating is a critical element of enterprise natural disaster risk management frameworks. The ratings companies, like Standard and Poors (S&amp;P), provide enterprise rating information which provides long-term corporate credit ratings. Although ratings do not imply a specific probability of default, historical default rates are frequently used to estimate these characteristics. The choice of the 99.97% coverage level (alternatively, 0.03% probability of default) was determined by evaluating the implicit risks and default rates over a one-year timeframe.</p>
<p>An enterprise's customers and letter-of-credit beneficiaries all have liability claims on the enterprise. Since these customers place a value on assurances of fulfillment of their contracts, they show a strong preference for enterprises with high credit ratings. As a consequence, a high credit rating is generally held to be essential for an enterprise to be a major corporate player, and it must be respected as a well risk-managed enterprise to compete effectively in the corporate market. This argument also suggests that if the importance of a high credit rating varies with the type of business, the risk control requirements will also vary. Requiring all manufacturers to be risk-mitigated at a particular level may create an additional burden for those businesses that require a lower credit rating.</p>
<p>The default probability that enterprises are willing to tolerate and the RCMs budget are the crucial decision behind formulating risk control strategy. A better rating or lower ruin probability increases the amount of risk control an enterprise should take and how much they should spend. The enterprise manager can decide a default probability level which is acceptable for customers and stakeholders, and also manage the budget dependent upon enterprise's fiscal position.</p>
<p>To achieve the targeted confidence level for the enterprise with RCMs, it is necessary to consider not only the volatility of RCMs, but also the probability distribution of potential risk reductions. The design strategy of risk control for each natural disaster was determined based on the exceeding probability and aggregate exceeding probability (AEP) curves which compute loss probability due to disasters over a given period. Once the enterprises choose various ruin stages according to their operational conditions, the EP curve can illustrate the probability of each ruin stage for a given enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311403182">Werner et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1077546311403182"><title>8. Business interruption insurance</title>
<p>Most people would never consider opening a business without buying insurance to cover damage due to fire and windstorms. However, too many business owners fail to think about how they would manage if a fire or other disaster damaged their business premises in such a way that they were temporarily unusable. Business interruption (BI) coverage is not sold separately. It is added to a property insurance policy or included in a package policy.</p>
<p>A business that must close down completely while its premises are being repaired may lose out to competitors. A quick resumption of business after a disaster is essential.</p>
<p>Business interruption insurance compensates owners for lost income if a company must vacate its premises due to disaster-related damage that is covered under property insurance policy, such as a fire. Business interruption insurance covers the profits that a company would have earned based on company financial records had the disaster not occurred. The policy also covers operating expenses, such as electricity, that continue even though business activities have come to a temporary halt.</p>
<p>The policy limits must be sufficient to cover the company for more than a few days. After a major disaster, it can take much longer than many people anticipate to resume business activities. There is generally a 48-hour waiting period before business interruption coverage kicks in.</p>
<p>The price of the policy is related to the risk of a fire, or other disaster premises. All things being equal, the price would probably be higher for a restaurant than a real estate agency, for example, because of the greater risk of fire. Also, a real estate agency can more easily operate out of another location.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1077546311403182"><title>9. Monte carlo method</title>
<p>Monte Carlo simulation is by far the most common method of assessing the predictive uncertainty of a model. The method is conceptually straightforward and has the advantage of applying to a very broad range of both linear and nonlinear flow and financial models. Given information about the statistical properties of the model input parameters (including those that represent forcing terms) or their log transformed values; numerous equally likely realizations of the parameters (or log parameters, as in the case of permeability and transmission) can be generated. If the model has been calibrated, the input statistics correspond to the posterior parameter estimates. If the model is not calibrated, they correspond to the prior estimates. If one assumes that the estimation errors are multivariate Gaussian, one has all the information needed to produce random realizations of the parameters.</p>
<p>Once a parameter realization has been generated, the model is run under a given scenario to generate a corresponding random prediction of system states. Upon averaging the predictions over all realizations, a sample mean prediction is obtained. As the number of such Monte Carlo runs increases, the sample mean converges to a theoretical ensemble mean. While such convergence can neither be insured nor verified in most cases, it is important to at least plot a representative measure of the sample mean versus the number of runs to verify that it has reached a stable value. The stable sample mean is then taken to constitute the best prediction the model can produce.</p>
<p>In addition to computing the sample mean, one typically also computes the sample variance of the predictions and generates a corresponding frequency histogram. Both converge more slowly to their theoretical ensemble equivalents than does the sample mean. It is therefore very important to verify that both have stabilized using a number of runs. Since most models are nonlinear, one need not expect the histogram of the predictions to resemble either a normal or a log normal distribution.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1077546311403182"><title>10. Probabilistic risk control arrangement problem model</title>
<p>In this paper, we present a proposed formulation under the optimal natural disaster risk control arrangement which lays the foundation for our proposed method. The proposed model aims at improving risk control budget efficiency. The basic idea is that enterprise managers have dominant rights over risk control measures that provide incentives for ‘winner picking’ – the practice of shifting funds from one risk control measure to another. The improvement in efficiency arises from a manager's ability to derive benefits from several risk control measures simultaneously. This implies that managers will sometimes be willing to take funds from weaker risk control measures and allocate these funds to relatively strong risk control measures. Moreover, in allocating budgets within an enterprise, the evaluation of risk control measures is important. Thus, an ordinal measure of the risk reduction associated with the enterprise's business operations is needed to allocate budgets among competing risk control measures. A new model of a probabilistic natural disaster risk control design is given by:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1077546311403182"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311403182-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1077546311403182"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311403182-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where f is an objective function. There are three crucial variables in this problem. First, there is the risk control measure that the enterprise manager takes. We identify a risk control actions by a. The second variable is n units of insurance policies which the enterprise manager decides to purchase from the insurer. The final variable is the amount of total direct and indirect loss after risk control has been taken, which we call L. <inline-formula id="ilm1-1077546311403182"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-1077546311403182"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mtext>,</mml:mtext><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mtext> m</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are constraint functions, where <inline-formula id="ilm2-1077546311403182"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-1077546311403182"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the R-percentile of <italic>AEP</italic><sup>R</sup><italic>(a, n)</italic>, and m is the number of constraints. Those could be multiple-purposes constraints depending on the enterprise manager's requirements. In the above probabilistic risk control arrangement model, the arrange feasibility is formulated as the total amount of loss of desired EP percentile less than or equal to a desired total loss amount L.</p>
<p>The desired EP percentile is the tolerable default level of probability of ruin that enterprises can accept. The desired total loss amount is the maximum economic impact that an enterprise asks for. EP percentile shows default probability or value at risk. The probability formulation in the risk control arrangement model is directly used to solve the problem. It optimizes the design objective subject to the tolerable default requirements. This is accomplished by assigning more budgets to the RCM which efficiently reduces target default risk. Assuming for the moment that the right measure of risk is used to allocate budget, this procedure implies that the same cost efficiency of an RCM budget should be used to evaluate all RCMs in the enterprise. In particular, allocating budget in this way is reasonable, even though the effects of RCM may vary widely across the various activities of the enterprise. Second, notice that the budget is allocated according to the RCM's risk reduction effects.</p>
<p>More importantly, if the enterprise's main concern is with providing a relative ranking of competing RCMs, allocating the budget based on reductions of target default risk will, in general, accomplish this goal. In particular, the true cost of RCM (or alternatively the amount of budget allocated to an RCM) is determined by the RCM's reductions of each target default risk. In addition to RCM budget planning, the model is used to evaluate the performance of RCMs for purposes of enterprise risk management.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1077546311403182"><title>11. Case study</title>
<p>An earthquake risk control design problem of a manufacturer is used to demonstrate the proposed method. The computational analysis of the impact of earthquake-resistant construction of the pressure vessels and piping has become a necessary tool to reduce the cost and development time for new facilities that meet corporate and government building codes and operational safety requirements. Since the effects of uncertainties associated with structural sizes, year built, number of stories, seismic code zones, material properties, and operational conditions in the facility pressure vessels and piping are of considerable importance, default risk based design optimization for facility earthquake resistance has gained increased attention and has been conducted in high-tech industries. Typically, in a default risk based design, the design feasibility is formulated as the total loss amount constraints, while the design objective is related to the nominal value of the objective function.</p>
<p>We assume that an enterprise of $1500 million in capital has two manufacturing pressure vessels and piping A and B, which are worth a combined $100 million and located in the northern and southern Taiwan, respectively. Their annual business operational volumes are $4000 million and $6000 million, respectively. These volumes are also the maximum business interruption which an earthquake could cause each year. These two manufacturing pressure vessels and piping were built in 1980 according to the 1974 Taiwan Building Code. Thus they are not very earthquake resistant and have a high probability of default. Hence, according to the facilities’ importance with respect to business operational volume and contributions to the entire enterprise, the facilities’ manager would seek to decrease their probability of ruin by taking two sorts of risk control measures, namely, pressure vessels and piping retrofitting and insurance protection. The manager can upgrade the facilities to meet the 1990 or 2000 period Taiwan Building Codes, which offer more protection. The Taiwan Building Codes were revised and updated in 1974, 1982, 1997 and 1999, respectively. The higher the operational volume of the factory, the lower its probability of ruin. After evaluation, the more RCMs is asked to take, the more budget should be allocated. According to the earthquake risk model established by National Central University, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311403182">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311403182">2</xref> show the EP curves of each factory built according to the 1974, 1982 and 1999 Taiwan Building Codes, respectively.</p>
<p>The other method is to purchase insurance. Insurance policies transfer earthquake damage and business interruption risk to insurance companies. The factory manager and insurance underwriter can together decide upon a deductible and sublimit of the insurance policy; meanwhile the maximum insurable values are $4100 million and $6100 million. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311403182">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311403182">5</xref> show the EP curves of several insurance policy conditions, i.e., the factories built according to the 1980 code without insurance, with 30% deductible and 80% sublimit, and with 10% deductible and 50% sublimit, respectively.
<fig id="fig5-1077546311403182" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Exceeding probability curves of factory B under several insurance policy conditions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311403182-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The manufactories’ R-percentile of exceeding probability curves and their associated total amount of loss are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077546311403182">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077546311403182">2</xref>. Pressure vessels and piping retrofit and insurance protection have different effects on exceeding probability curve. The retrofit action reduces total loss, but insurance protection does not. At the 1.00-percentile level, for each factory, structural retrofit decreases total loss more than insurance protection does. However, at 0.01-percentile level, the effective difference between these two measures is not as great. This is because the deductible of the insurance policy withholds protection if small or medium disasters occur. Conversely, structural retrofit is more expensive than insurance protection. As estimated, upgrading to 1990 code levels costs around $10 million, and upgrading to 2000 code level costs around $30 million; but insurance premium rates are only about 1% of the total sum insured per year.

<p>To design optimal risk control measures, we choose two sets of random variables a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub> and n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>. a<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>1</sub> represent cost of the structural retrofit and insurance protection for factory A, and a<sub>2</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> for factory B. Upgrading from the 1980 code to the 1990 code level, within this range, the variable of retrofit cost is a proportional of $10 million. Likewise, upgrading from the 1990 code to the 2000 code level, the variable of retrofit cost is a proportional of $20 million. However, insurance premium rates are discontinuous; from 10% to 30% of the total sum insured, the premium rate is 1% per year; from 30% to 50% of the total sum insured, the premium rate is 0.7% per year; from 50% to 80% of the total sum insured, the premium rate is 0.5% per year. We seek to minimize the total cost of RCMs of both factories, subject to several desired tolerable default thresholds required by the enterprise manager.</p>
<p>The enterprise manager determines any desired tolerable default threshold which suits the factory's priorities, operations, and financial conditions. The manager hopes to achieve an S&amp;P rating of a certain level, because this is also the tolerable safety that shareholders and stakeholders are willing to tolerate. The default probability of the S&amp;P rating level coverage level is 0.3%, so the manager does not have to take measures to control total loss amounts which are below 0.3% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311403182">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311403182">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311403182">5</xref>). No matter how much the total loss amounts to, assuming risk is kept below 0.3%, the shareholders will not blame the manager for neglect of duty. Losses having probability of greater than 0.3%, the shareholders hope these losses do not reduce profitability. Such losses should never imperil the survival of the enterprise. For this reason, the manager requires that the two factories’ total losses that exceed 0.4% probability must be less than or equal to the enterprise's capital reserves of $1,500 million. According to contribution to annual business operational volume, factory A's total losses exceeding a probability 0.4% must be less than or equal to 40% of enterprise capital, while factory B's must be less than or equal to 60% of its capital. Factory B's total losses exceeding probability of 2.0% must be less than or equal to 30% of its capital.</p>

Each of these individual risk control budgeting allocations is then aggregated to arrive at the optimal budgetary level for the enterprise.</p>
<p>For this example, exact Monte Carlo computation shows that the minimum enterprise manager's cost, which does lie in a<sub>1</sub> = 1,455,662, n<sub>1</sub> = 2,725,479, a<sub>2</sub> = 3,243,791 and n<sub>2</sub> = 1,251,216. For manufactory A, the manager should retrofit the pressure vessels and piping to the earthquake-resistant level of the 1982 building code and purchasing insurance policies of 38% deductible and 80% sublimit. For manufactory B, the manager should retrofit the pressure vessels and piping to the level of the 1999 building code and purchasing insurance policies of 55% deductible and 80% sublimit. In this way, he or she will minimize the cost, which satisfies all the constraints.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1077546311403182"><title>12. Conclusion</title>
<p>There has been increasing interest in the optimal algorithm and its applications in recent years (for example, see Hsiao et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2006; Chen, 2006; Chen et al., 2006, 2007, 2008; Tsai et al., 2008; Yeh et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009; Lin and Chen, 2010; Chen et al., 2010; Yeh et al., 2010; Lin and Chen, 2010 and the references therein). In this paper, the volatility of an enterprise's reported earnings and risk is critical to determining risk control adequacy. Value-at-risk, exceeding probability, and aggregate exceeding probability curves are understood and applied widely throughout industry, especially in obtaining ratings. When having sufficient reliable information on relevant conditions and factors, we prefer to adopt probabilistic analysis. However, in most cases, such reliable information is absent, so deterministic analysis adopted. Even so, we suggest that a manager analyzes as much as possible. The manager should not only be diligent in finding the optimal solution under constraints, but also in determining the riskiest or most efficient factors. Although optimal solutions are important, realizing the weakest and strongest parts of the whole project is even more significant. In real world applications, optimal strategy may vary by time and environment on a case by case basis. By focusing upon the key points of weakness, one can efficiently find a suitable strategy in a timely manner in response to a sudden event.</p>
<p>Since a probabilistic optimization involves EP curves for the overall optimization and iterative probabilistic assessment, the computational demand is extremely high. The financial risk tolerance assessment can only be conducted after the deterministic optimization to verify constraint feasibility under uncertainty. Moreover, the RCM budgeting process is an integral part of not only the risk evaluation process of the enterprise but also of the RCM performance evaluation system of senior management.</p></sec>

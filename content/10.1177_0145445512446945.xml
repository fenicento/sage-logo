<abstract>
<p>A common assumption among clinicians and researchers is that war trauma primarily involves fear-based reactions to life-threatening situations. However, the authors believe that there are multiple types of trauma in the military context, each with unique perievent and postevent response patterns. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed structured clinical interviews of 122 active duty service members and assigned the reported index (principal, most currently distressing) events to one or more of the following categories: Life Threat to Self, Life Threat to Others, Aftermath of Violence, Traumatic Loss, Moral Injury by Self, and Moral Injury by Others. They found high interrater reliability for the coding scheme and support for the construct validity of the categorizations. In addition, they discovered that certain categories were related to psychiatric symptoms (e.g., reexperiencing of the traumatic event, guilt, anger) and negative thoughts about the world. Their study provides tentative support for use of these event categories.</p>

<p>Traditionally, trauma researchers and clinicians have focused on the impact of life-threatening events. Although important, this focus may be too narrow, especially in the military context in which service members often experience many diverse, potentially traumatic, high-magnitude combat and operational stressors. In fact, survey studies confirm the need to think broadly about war-zone exposure. For example, service members who served in the combat theater of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have reported considerable heterogeneity of high-magnitude events, such as being attacked or ambushed, seeing dead bodies or human remains, and personally knowing someone who was seriously injured or killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512446945">Hoge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512446945">Mental Health Advisory Team [MHAT], 2003</xref>). Although each of these events satisfies Criterion A1 for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512446945">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>), the last two do not involve life threat per se. Furthermore, these event types could affect service members differently in terms of perievent impact and responses over time. For example, being attacked or ambushed may create fear or helplessness, seeing dead bodies or human remains may elicit disgust or horror, and knowing that someone close to you was seriously injured or killed likely leads to sadness or guilt.</p>
<p>Another category of war-related experiences involves severe moral and ethical challenges in the combat context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512446945">Litz et al., 2009</xref>). For example, service members can experience psychological injuries from killing the enemy in battle, failing to prevent harm to others, and witnessing cruel and inhumane acts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512446945">Beckham, Feldman, &amp; Kirby, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512446945">Fontana &amp; Rosenheck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512446945">King, King, Gudanowski, &amp; Vreven, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512446945">Maguen et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the guerilla wars of insurgency in urban settings in the Iraq and Afghanistan context pose ambiguous, fleeting, and asymmetrical features (e.g., unmarked enemies, civilian threats, improvised explosive devices) that challenge the rules of engagement and make it difficult for service members to decide on the appropriate course of action in a given situation. In addition, the burden of multiple and longer deployments may affect ethical decision making as losses of unit members and adversities mount. Indeed, an increase in deployment length has been linked to a rise in the number of potentially morally injurious events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512446945">MHAT-V, 2008</xref>). Emotional consequences for those involved may include guilt and shame experiences that are putatively highly divergent to life-threat-based fear experiences.</p>
<p>Based on the assumptions that military trauma is multifaceted and that there are discernible, separate categories of high-magnitude events associated with varying phenomenology, trajectories, and treatment-response patterns, we sought to create a rating scheme that would facilitate the assessment of event type and could aid in the provision of care to service members and veterans. In the future, treatments could be tailored to individuals based on the primary source of their distress. We relied on the war-stress and trauma literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512446945">Carlson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512446945">Fontana &amp; Rosenheck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512446945">King et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512446945">Litz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512446945">Nash, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512446945">Renshaw, 2011</xref>) and clinical experiences with active duty service personnel and veterans to develop the following categories: Life Threat to Self, Life Threat to Others, Aftermath of Violence, Traumatic Loss, Moral Injury by Self, and Moral Injury by Others (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0145445512446945">appendix</xref> for definitions). Other possible stressor categories (e.g., malevolent environment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512446945">King et al., 1995</xref>) were not included in the list because they do not meet the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512446945">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) criteria for a traumatic event.</p>
<p>We intended the categories to be independent but not mutually exclusive; that is, we assumed that each category could contain certain events entirely and that some events would span multiple categories. For example, watching someone incur a serious injury (but survive) would be coded as Life Threat to Others only and learning about (as opposed to witnessing) the death of a close friend or unit member would be coded for Traumatic Loss only. However, observing a friend get shot and killed would be coded as Life Threat to Others and Traumatic Loss. Finally, we viewed these six categories as an exhaustive list; the service members and veterans whom we have encountered in clinical and research settings seem to be haunted by one of these six elements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0145445512446945">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>To test the reliability and validity of our coding scheme, we used a two-step analytical approach. First, we assigned categories to events endorsed as the most currently distressing (i.e., index events) by previously deployed service members in the context of a PTSD clinical interview and determined the interrater reliability of the coding scheme (Part 1). Then, we tested whether an exposure category was associated with different perievent and postevent emotional factors and current symptom profiles (Part 2). To accomplish this, we correlated the categories with factors developed from a list of emotional responses and performed multiple linear regressions with common indices of psychiatric symptoms.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was conducted as part of the South Texas Research Organizational Network Guiding Studies on Trauma and Resilience (STRONG STAR) Consortium. STRONG STAR is a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research consortium that is conducting clinical trials of active duty service members and veterans with PTSD. All portions of this study were reviewed and approved as a retrospective clinical records review by the Institutional Review Boards of the VA Boston Healthcare System, the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, and Brooke Army Medical Center. The study was also reviewed and approved by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Office of Research Protections, Human Research Protection Office.</p>
<sec id="section3-0145445512446945">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Between August 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, 143 active duty service members were assessed by the STRONG STAR staff at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Ft. Hood, Texas, as part of their treatment for PTSD symptoms. For purposes of our analyses, we excluded 15 participants who were unable to identify the traumatic event(s) that was currently causing them the most distress (<italic>n</italic> = 7) or who did not provide enough details of the event(s) for us to make an informed decision about the nature of their trauma (<italic>n</italic> = 8). One participant was excluded because he did not speak fluent English. The remaining participants either selected a single, episodic index event (<italic>n</italic> = 119); a single, repetitive index event (e.g., frequent incoming fire; <italic>n</italic> = 6); or two equally distressing index events (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p>

<title>PTSD Symptom Scale, Interview Version (PSS-I)</title>
<p>The PSS-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512446945">Foa, Riggs, Dancu, &amp; Rothbaum, 1993</xref>) is a 20- to 30-min, 17-item, clinician-administered interview that evaluates each of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD symptoms during the past 2 weeks. It is comparable with the gold standard PTSD assessment (i.e., the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512446945">Blake et al., 1990</xref>); however, it takes considerably less time to administer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512446945">Foa &amp; Tolin, 2000</xref>). This measure was selected to help reduce the assessment burden for active duty military personnel. It has been recommended by an expert PTSD work group as one of the common data elements for research on PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512446945">Kaloupek et al., 2010</xref>). The measure has been shown to have excellent internal consistency (α = .85), test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .80), and interrater reliability (κ = .91; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512446945">Foa et al., 1993</xref>). For the current study, alpha was .72.</p>
<p>Interviews were administered by blinded (to treatment group) independent evaluators (IEs) who had participated in three stages of training: classroom instruction with an expert in the field, mock interviews with coworkers, and corating exercises with previously taped assessments. After the completion of training, all IEs engaged in weekly calibration exercises to ensure high-quality standards throughout the study. Any drift in scoring (i.e., failure to match decisions about PTSD diagnosis with the trainers or a total score that was more than a 3-point deviation from the average score of the trainers) was brought to the attention of the IE so that the problem could be corrected in future assessments.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the interview, participants selected the event(s) from the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory (DRRI) Combat Experiences Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512446945">King, King, Vogt, Knight, &amp; Samper, 2006</xref>), the DRRI Aftermath of Battle Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512446945">King et al., 2006</xref>), or the Life Events Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512446945">Gray, Litz, Hsu, &amp; Lombardo, 2004</xref>) that was causing them the most distress currently—that is, the index event(s). To help identify the index event(s), a series of questions were asked: “Which of these experiences currently gets in the way of your life the most?” “Which one of these events do you find yourself having the most upsetting and unwanted thoughts about lately?” “What is the event(s) that most often comes into your head?” “What is the event(s) that makes you most distressed/upset/anxious/nervous when it comes into your head in thoughts or flashbacks, or when you are reminded of it?” and “Do you have nightmares about any particular event?” If the participant was unable to identify specific events, then the general term <italic>worst deployment experiences</italic> (or <italic>worst experiences</italic> if the worst traumatic experiences included nonmilitary events) was recorded and referenced throughout the rest of the interview. Only four participants identified an event that occurred outside of a military context.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the interview, the PTSD items were anchored to the index event(s) and rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 3 = <italic>five or more times per week/very much</italic>. Three subscale scores were calculated by summing item scores in each of the PTSD symptom clusters: reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145445512446945">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The first and second authors created definitions for the six categories and independently assigned at least one category to each of the index events. After meeting to discuss and resolve discrepancies, we trained two IEs to apply our categorization scheme by reviewing the definitions, providing practice items, and offering group feedback. Finally, each evaluator separately coded the same list of index events that we had coded earlier. Instructions included the following: (a) Only code the most salient aspects of each description; (b) unless otherwise indicated, assume that the events occurred during the service members’ combat or operational experiences; however, do not make any other assumptions; and (c) if the event does not fit cleanly into one of the categories, choose the best one.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145445512446945">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>First, we converted the joint ratings of the first two authors into six dichotomous variables. For example, if the first two authors agreed that an event involved Life Threat to Others and Traumatic Loss, then these two categories were assigned a “1” and the other four categories were assigned a “0.” Then, we calculated frequencies and bivariate correlations to assess the viability of the six categories. If the base rate of one of the categories was too low or the correlations between two categories were too high, we would have considered merging them. We predicted that the correlations would be low. Finally, we assessed interrater reliability of the three sets of ratings (from us and the two IEs) using Fleiss’ kappa statistics.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145445512446945">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 127 index events, more than 50% (<italic>n</italic> = 66) were assigned to more than one category. Although many of the index events involved Life Threat to Self (30%) or Life Threat to Others (40%), a large number of events were assigned to the other categories: Aftermath of Violence (35%), Traumatic Loss (30%), Moral Injury by Self (12%), and Moral Injury by Others (22%). The strongest correlations were between Life Threat to Self and Aftermath of Violence (<italic>r</italic> = −.45), Life Threat to Other and Traumatic Loss (<italic>r</italic> = .36), and Life Threat to Self and Traumatic Loss (<italic>r</italic> = −.30). No other correlations were above an absolute value of .30. Kappa statistics for the six categories were substantial (.84, .81, .86, .95, .90, and .78, respectively), suggesting very good reliability for the categorization scheme.</p>

<title>Part 2: Validation of the Categories</title>
<sec id="section10-0145445512446945">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To explore the construct and criterion-related validity of the categorization scheme, we examined the relationships between the trauma categories and perievent and postevent emotional factors, the most pertinent psychiatric symptoms, and related maladaptive cognitions. In addition to the PSS-I, participants completed the Peritraumatic and Posttraumatic Emotions Questionnaire (PTEQ), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition (BDI-II), the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI), and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) during their baseline assessment. The PTCI and the TRGI measures each have three subscales.</p>
<sec id="section11-0145445512446945">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section12-0145445512446945">
<title>PTEQ</title>
<p>The PTEQ is a self-report measure that was adapted from the Standardized Trauma Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512446945">Resick, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512446945">Resick, Jordan, Girelli, &amp; Hutter, 1988</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512446945">Kaysen, Morris, Rizvi, &amp; Resick, 2005</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512446945">Rizvi, Kaysen, Gutner, Griffin, &amp; Resick, 2008</xref>, for similar adaptations). It contains a list of feelings/emotions that respondents rate on a scale from 0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 4 = <italic>all of the time</italic> based on how they felt during the index event and how they feel now when they think about the event or are reminded of it. In the current study, the 20 items had an internal consistency of α = .88 for the Peritraumatic subscale and α = .89 for the Posttraumatic subscale. To gain a better understanding of the underlying structure, we conducted two exploratory factor analyses (one for the peritraumatic emotions and one for the posttraumatic emotions) using SPSS 17.0 with Promax rotation. Decisions about the number of factors were based on the number of eigenvalues above unity, the number and pattern of cross loadings (i.e., items that had loadings above .40 on multiple factors), and the consistency of the results with research and theory.</p>
<p>The factor analysis for the peritraumatic emotions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445512446945">Table 1</xref>) yielded six factors: <italic>Afraid</italic> (α = .84), <italic>Humiliated</italic> (α = .86), <italic>Detached</italic> (α = .65), <italic>Angry</italic> (α = .81), <italic>Horrified</italic> (α = .90), and <italic>Sad</italic> (α = .76). Two of these factors roughly correspond to Criterion A2: fear (with <italic>Afraid</italic>) and horror (with <italic>Horrified</italic>). The other factors are commonly reported reactions to trauma (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512446945">Resick &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>). The factor analysis for the posttraumatic emotions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145445512446945">Table 2</xref>) produced five factors: <italic>Afraid</italic> (α = .86), <italic>Humiliated</italic> (α = .90), <italic>Sad</italic> (α = .66), <italic>Angry</italic> (α = .79), and <italic>Numb</italic> (α = .65). The items relating to horror were subsumed under Afraid. For both analyses, labels were assigned based on the feeling/emotion with the largest loading on each factor. The two sets of factors accounted for 72% and 67% of the variance, respectively.</p>

<title>BAI</title>
<p>The BAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512446945">Beck, Epstein, Brown, &amp; Steer, 1988</xref>) is a 21-item measure that asks participants to rate the severity of their anxiety symptoms within the past week on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 3 = <italic>severely</italic>. Scores on items are summed to obtain a general anxiety score, indicating the presence of physical and/or psychological symptoms of anxiety. Among psychiatric outpatients, the BAI has been shown to reliably discriminate between anxious and nonanxious diagnostic groups, demonstrates high internal consistency (α = .92) and test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .75), and is found to have appropriate convergent validity with other measures of anxiety (e.g., Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512446945">Beck et al., 1988</xref>). In our study, alpha was found to be .91.</p>

<title>BDI-II</title>
<p>The BDI-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512446945">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>) is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 21 items that assess affective and somatic symptoms of depression. Each item is composed of four or six statements that reflect symptom severity. The statements are scaled from 0 = <italic>no disturbance</italic> to 3 = <italic>maximal disturbance</italic>. Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score. The BDI-II has demonstrated an internal consistency of .91 and convergent validity with psychiatric diagnosis and other measures of psychological distress (e.g., the BAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512446945">Beck et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown to have high test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .96) over a 1-week period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512446945">Sprinkle et al., 2002</xref>). The alpha coefficient for our study was .90.</p>

<sec id="section15-0145445512446945">
<title>PTCI</title>
<p>The PTCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512446945">Foa, Elhers, Clark, Tolin, &amp; Orsillo, 1999</xref>) is a 36-item questionnaire that assesses trauma-related thoughts and beliefs that are expected to contribute to the development and maintenance of PTSD. Responses are provided using a 7-point Likert-type scale with anchors 1 = <italic>totally disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>totally agree</italic>. The questionnaire comprises three subscales (i.e., Negative Cognitions About the Self, Negative Cognitions About the World, and Self-Blame) calculated by taking the mean score of the corresponding items, with higher scores indicating increased levels of maladaptive posttraumatic cognitions. Subscales have been found to have strong internal consistency with alpha coefficients ranging from .86 to .97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512446945">Foa et al., 1999</xref>). In our study, these coefficients were .93, .85, and .76, respectively. Convergent validity has been demonstrated by comparing the PTCI with appropriate subscales of the World Assumptions Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512446945">Janoff-Bulman, 1989</xref>) and Personal Beliefs and Reactions Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512446945">Resick, Schnicke, &amp; Markway, 1991</xref>). The PTCI has been found to differentiate individuals with and without PTSD. Test–retest reliabilities for the subscales have ranged from .75 to .89 for 1-week intervals.</p>

<sec id="section16-0145445512446945">
<title>TRGI</title>
<p>The TRGI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512446945">Kubany et al., 1996</xref>) was developed to assess guilt feelings and attitudes. It includes three scales and three subscales, assessed using 32 items that are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale with anchors 0 = <italic>not at all true</italic> to 4 = <italic>extremely true</italic>. In a sample of Vietnam veterans, the alpha coefficients for construct subscales ranged from .66 to .94. For this study, we selected the 16 items from the Guilt Cognitions scale that make up the three subscales (i.e., Hindsight-Bias/Responsibility, Wrongdoing, and Lack of Justification). The Hindsight-Bias/Responsibility subscale includes items such as “I could have prevented what happened” and “I blame myself for what happened.” The Wrongdoing subscale includes items such as “I did something that went against my values” and “I had some thoughts or beliefs that I should not have had.” Finally, the Lack of Justification subscale includes items such as “What I did made sense” and “I had good reasons for doing what I did.” All items in this subscale were reverse scored, such that higher scores indicated greater levels of trauma-related guilt. Alpha coefficients for the three subscales were .92, .69, and .82, respectively.</p>

<title>STAXI</title>
<p>The STAXI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512446945">Spielberger, 1988</xref>) is a 44-item scale that evaluates several dimensions of anger. The current study administered the 10 items from the State Anger subscale as they are the most likely to change with treatment. Items in this subscale ask participants to indicate how much they are currently experiencing certain feelings and desires on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 4 = <italic>very much so</italic>. Items are then summed to assess the overall intensity of anger felt at a particular moment in time. Internal consistency of the subscale has been found to be strong (α = .90), as has its convergent validity with measures of hostility and other personality scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512446945">Spielberger, 1988</xref>). In our sample, the alpha coefficient was .92.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0145445512446945">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To test the construct validity of the categories, we calculated point-biserial correlations between the dichotomous variables for the six categories and the factor scores from the PTEQ. As in Part 1, the dichotomous variables were based on the joint ratings of the first and second authors. We predicted Life Threat to Self to be correlated with Afraid and Horror. In addition, we predicted Life Threat to Others to be associated with Afraid and Sad; Aftermath of Violence to be associated with Horror; Traumatic Loss to be associated with Sad and Angry; Moral Injury by Self to be associated with Humiliated, Sad, and Numb; and Moral Injury by Others to be associated with Humiliated and Angry. For Life Threat to Self, Life Threat to Others, Aftermath of Violence, and Traumatic Loss, we expected that the correlations would be significant for the peritraumatic reactions only, as primary emotions (e.g., fear, sadness) are likely to dissipate over time. For Moral Injury by Self and Moral Injury by Others, we expected that the correlations would be significant for the posttraumatic reactions only as we believe that moral injury is most likely to manifest itself after individuals have time to reflect on the implications of their actions or the actions of others.</p>
<p>Because we were interested in the relationship between event categories and indices of psychiatric distress and symptoms, we performed a series of exploratory regressions using the BAI, BDI-II, PTCI, TRGI, STAXI, and the PSS-I as outcomes. We chose to use regressions instead of correlations to assess the relative strength of the categories in predicting the psychiatric outcomes. Because our categorization scheme is new, we had few hypotheses about the specific predictors of these symptoms. However, we expected Moral Injury by Self to be significant in the models for the three subscales of the TRGI and one subscale of the PTCI (Negative Cognitions About the Self).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 12 predictions involving peritrauma and posttrauma reactions, 8 were significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145445512446945">Table 3</xref>). These results provide preliminary evidence for the construct validity of the categories. In addition, there were small, positive correlations (<italic>r</italic> = .13-.17) between Life Threat to Self and Sad (a peritrauma response), Aftermath of Violence and Horror (a peritrauma response), and Moral Injury by Others and Angry (a posttrauma response). Unexpectedly, there was virtually no association between Life Threat to Others and Afraid (a peritraumatic response; <italic>r</italic> = −.02); however, post hoc analyses revealed that this correlation was artificially lowered because of the correlation between Life Threat to Self and Afraid. By excluding individuals who experienced a Life Threat to Self but not a Life Threat to Others, the correlation between Life Threat to Others and Afraid increased to <italic>r</italic> = .11. As expected, Moral Injury by Self and Moral Injury by Others were more strongly correlated with posttrauma reactions than with peritrauma reactions. This indicates that intense emotions are more likely to appear following an event with moral and ethical implications than during it (presumably due to the additional time afforded for reflection).</p>

<p>As expected, Moral Injury by Self was a significant predictor of two TRGI subscales: Hindsight-Bias/Responsibility and Wrongdoing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145445512446945">Table 4</xref>). It was also a significant predictor of the severity of reexperiencing symptoms. However, it was not significant in the model for the third TRGI subscale (i.e., Lack of Justification). It appears that service members may feel guilty about their actions even though they can understand the underlying rationale for them and the influence of the unique context. Other significant predictors included Aftermath of Violence for Negative Cognitions About the World and Moral Injury by Others for state anger. No predictors were found to be statistically reliable for the BAI, the BDI-II, the other two PTSD symptom clusters (i.e., the avoidance cluster and the hyperarousal cluster), and the other two subscales of the PTCI (i.e., Negative Cognitions about the Self and Self-Blame), although Moral Injury by Self was marginally significant in the prediction of Negative Cognitions about the Self (β = .26, <italic>SE</italic> = .46, <italic>p</italic> = .056).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings in Part 1 of the study suggest that the most distressing and haunting events experienced by active duty service members involve more than life threat to self or others. They also involve witnessing the aftermath of violence, experiencing a traumatic loss, and committing or observing acts that violate moral or ethical standards. In addition, category assignments of the traumatic military experiences had high interrater reliabilities, ranging from .78 (Moral Injury by Others) to .95 (Traumatic Loss). This indicates that the current categorization scheme may be used reliably by clinicians and other trained evaluators to qualitatively determine the nature of a reported Criterion A event.</p>
<p>In Part 2 of the study, we explored the construct validity of the categorization scheme by examining the relationships between the six categories and peritraumatic and posttraumatic emotions from the PTEQ. Results supported the hypothesis that categories would be associated with unique patterns of peritraumatic and posttraumatic sequelae, because 8 of our 12 predictions were statistically significant. In general, the most robust patterns were found for the three categories: Life Threat to Self, Traumatic Loss, and Moral Injury by Self. Clinicians should be particularly cognizant of the specific emotional reactions likely to be seen among individuals presenting with these types of Criterion A events.</p>
<p>Furthermore, exploratory analyses were conducted to investigate the predictive utility of the six categories in relation to specific psychiatric symptoms and maladaptive thoughts. Because there was no previous research in this area, few specific predictions were made. However, it was expected that Moral Injury by Self would be related to specific aspects of guilt, including hindsight-bias/responsibility, wrongdoing, and lack of justification, as well as to an increase in negative cognitions about the self. Results partially supported these predictions. As expected, Moral Injury by Self was the best predictor of two aspects of guilt (hindsight-bias/responsibility and wrongdoing). Furthermore, Moral Injury by Self was the best predictor of reexperiencing symptoms. These findings are consistent with studies of Vietnam veterans who found that committing atrocities or abusive violence has the strongest relationship with PTSD symptoms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512446945">Beckham et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512446945">King et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512446945">Yehuda, Southwick, &amp; Giller, 1992</xref>) and may emanate from severe shame, social withdrawal, and a failure to forgive the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512446945">Litz et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, this finding could indicate that events that are incompatible with self-schema (i.e., those categorized as Moral Injury by Self) are difficult to process, creating unwanted intrusions. In addition, Moral Injury by Others was a significant predictor of state anger. This suggests that moral injury stemming from the actions of others (e.g., incidents of betrayal, excessive violence by the enemy) should be assessed and treated to reduce the risk of violence to others. For example, a service member might want to exact revenge against the person (e.g., leader, unit member) who betrayed him or her. Finally, Aftermath of Violence was associated with negative cognitions about the world. These often rigid, global thoughts may need to be assessed and modified in treatment before significant gains can be realized, particularly in the area of social functioning.</p>
<sec id="section21-0145445512446945">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Although the reliability of the categorization scheme was high, it was not perfect. We tried to code the most salient parts of the event description; however, in a few cases, the most salient parts of the event description were ambiguous. For example, a description that includes the words “convoy attacked” could indicate a serious threat to the service member, to other unit members, or both, or it could have been added to provide context. In the future, evaluators should pose the following question to the service members to increase clarity about the index event(s)—What were the worst parts of your traumatic event (please select all that apply): (a) the threat to your life; (b) the threat to the life of someone else; (c) the sights, sounds, and smells of the event; (d) the loss of a family member, friend, or unit member; (e) something that you did or failed to do; and (f) something that someone else did or failed to do. These six options roughly correspond to our six event types.</p>
<p>Because our sample was limited to treatment-seeking OEF/OIF soldiers, the results may be biased. For example, the distribution of combat exposures and the level of distress may not generalize to a broader range of service personnel. Another limitation is that only one sample was used in the validation process. Further validation of the categorization scheme with other samples is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about its validity. Finally, the fact that we conducted a large number of statistical tests increases the possibility of Type I error. Because this was the first study of its kind, we were more concerned about Type II error and thus did not adjust the error rate for multiple tests. This also underscores the need to replicate the results with other samples of service members and veterans.</p>
<p>In future research, the coding scheme for deployment trauma could be used to examine event type as a predictor of military mental and behavioral health outcomes and as a moderator of treatment outcome. With regard to the latter, certain PTSD therapies may be more appropriate for service members or veterans who have been exposed to particular types of combat and operational traumas. For example, given that exposure therapies (e.g., prolonged exposure; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512446945">Foa, Rothbaum, Riggs, &amp; Murdock, 1991</xref>) are based on the fear-extinction paradigm, it is likely that they would be more effective for events categorized as Life Threat to Self or Life Threat to Others than the other four categories. However, therapies that specifically target metacognitions (e.g., cognitive processing therapy, adaptive disclosure; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512446945">Resick, Monson, &amp; Chard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512446945">Steenkamp et al., 2011</xref>) might be more amenable to a broader array of traumas, including complex traumas involving moral injury. These are empirical questions that need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, moderation analyses could be used to match treatments to event types or to identify the need to refine treatment strategies to better address the full complement of traumatic war-zone events.</p>
<p>Although further research is needed to extend and validate these results, our categorization scheme may have immediate heuristic value in service of raising awareness among mental health professionals and military personnel about the multiple sources of military trauma (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512446945">Nash, Steenkamp, Conoscenti, &amp; Litz, 2011</xref>). We believe that this would improve the care of service members and veterans. For example, if clinicians begin to consider moral injury in the aftermath of war trauma, treatment planning could evolve to meet the unique phenomenology and problems pertaining to perpetration- or betrayal-based war experiences (e.g., Gray et al., in press). Alternatively, suffering that stems primarily from war-zone loss may be treated with strategies that specifically target prolonged grief (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512446945">Shear, Frank, Houck, &amp; Reynolds, 2005</xref>).</p>

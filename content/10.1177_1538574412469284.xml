<abstract>
<p>Adrenal artery rupture is a rare cause of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. We describe 2 cases of spontaneous rupture of the adrenal artery successfully treated using endovascular coil embolization. Case Report: Two patients presented with sudden onset abdominal pain and hemodynamic compromise. In both the cases computed tomography (CT) showed a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Aortography confirmed bleeding from the right inferior adrenal artery in the first patient and the left inferior adrenal artery in the second patient. Both patients were treated with endovascular coil embolization. Subsequent CT scans demonstrated a reduction in the size of the retroperitoneal hematoma with no active bleeding. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of a ruptured adrenal artery is effective, safe, and permits organ preservation.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<sec id="section2-1538574412469284">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 71-year-old man with known hypertension presented to the emergency department with sudden onset right hypochondrial pain and hypovolemic shock. He previously had a subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma, possibly involving the right kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412469284">Figure 1</xref>). He was transferred to the regional vascular unit following resuscitation using intravenous fluids and blood products.</p>

</fig>
<p>An urgent aortogram performed using a right common femoral arterial approach confirmed bleeding from the right inferior adrenal artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412469284">Figure 2</xref>). Through a 6-F RDC guide catheter positioned at the renal artery, a 4-F right coronary catheter was introduced coaxially to catheterize the right inferior adrenal artery. Six numbers of 3 mm by 1.5 cm coils were deployed successfully to occlude the artery as confirmed by postprocedure angiography which revealed no active bleeding.</p>

</fig>
<p>Three days later the patient developed fast atrial fibrillation and acute dyspnea. The CT pulmonary angiogram excluded a pulmonary embolus, but showed a right pleural effusion with basal lung collapse and consolidation. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and made a full recovery. He was discharged home 7 days after the procedure.</p>
<p>A CT scan at 24 months showed complete resolution of the retroperitoneal hemorrhage with no parenchymal abnormalities of the adrenal gland. The patient remains asymptomatic 4 years after the treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1538574412469284">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 55-year-old gentleman presented to the local emergency department complaining of gradual onset left iliac fossa pain with no associated gastrointestinal symptoms. He had previously had an appendicectomy, transient ischemic attack, and acute pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left iliac fossa with no signs of peritonitis. The CT imaging revealed a mass lesion adjacent to the descending colon, diagnosed as a diverticular phlegmon. He was treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and discharged home 4 days later with a further course of oral antibiotics.</p>
<p>He presented to the emergency department 5 days later with recurrent abdominal pain, initially in the epigastrium and subsequently localized to the left iliac fossa and loin. There were no associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left iliac fossa with periumbilical bruising consistent with Cullen sign, in addition to scrotal bruising. He was hemodynamically stable.</p>
<p>Further imaging by CT showed a large left retroperitoneal hematoma measuring 8.3 cm by 13 cm. In the arterial phase, there was a 17 mm intensely enhancing blush suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm arising from 1 of the 3 left adrenal arteries.</p>
<p>The patient underwent left adrenal artery embolization. The right common femoral artery was cannulated and an aortogram confirmed active bleeding from the left inferior adrenal artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574412469284">Figure 3</xref>). A 6-F guidewire was used and using a 4-F right coronary catheter the inferior adrenal artery was catheterized. Seven numbers of 6 mm by 5 cm coils were used to embolize the sac with the tail of the last coil being used to embolize the artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538574412469284">Figure 4</xref>). Blood pressure was controlled with sublingual glyceryl trinitrate spray. There was no active bleeding at the end of the procedure. The patient was discharged home 2 days after the procedure. At 2 months follow-up, a CT scan showed a significant reduction in the size of the hematoma with no enhancing areas.</p>

<p>At 12-month review, the patient remained asymptomatic with no evidence of further bleeding. A CT scan confirmed marked resolution in the size of the hematoma which now measured 3 cm by 4 cm in diameter. There was no active bleeding from the adrenal artery or parenchymal abnormalities of the adrenal gland.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Spontaneous rupture of the adrenal artery is a rare cause of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412469284">1</xref>
</sup> Autopsy studies have revealed that adrenal hemorrhage is more common than is clinically suspected.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412469284">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412469284"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412469284">4</xref>
</sup> It usually occurs when there is an underlying abnormality of the adrenal gland, if there is thrombosis of the central vein, or if there are systemic factors that predispose the individual to bleeding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412469284">5</xref>
</sup> Rarely, it is the result of rupture from an adrenal artery aneurysm. Spontaneous rupture of the adrenal artery in the absence of these risk factors has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>Hemorrhage into adrenal tumors is a well-recognized cause of retroperitoneal bleeding. Thrombosis of the central adrenal vein occurs in the stressed, involuting, or hyperplastic adrenal gland as in pregnancy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412469284">6</xref>
</sup> the puerperal state, or the neonate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412469284">7</xref>
</sup> Hemorrhagic necrosis occurs in severe systemic illness associated with sepsis (Waterhouse-Friedrichsen syndrome), burns, systemic embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or the postoperative state. The gland undergoes necrosis and if bilateral, there may be signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. These patients are usually treated with supportive measures and a nonsurgical approach is more appropriate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412469284">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Adrenal artery aneurysms are a rare cause of retroperitoneal hemorrhage with only 8 previous cases described in the literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412469284">9</xref>

</sup> The etiology is unknown. Congenital malformation of the artery or disease processes that impair the integrity of the arterial wall have been implicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412469284">17</xref>
</sup> The latter includes atherosclerosis, trauma, connective tissue disorders, inflammation of nearby viscera, infective conditions such as endocarditis, or mycotic embolization. Rupture from adrenal artery aneurysms is often mistaken for renal colic leading to delay in diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Our second patient was misdiagnosed with diverticulitis. A high index of suspicion coupled with early imaging and angiography is necessary to make a timely diagnosis. As these aneurysms are associated with a high risk of rupture, there is a narrow window to intervene if the initial hemorrhage is contained but free abdominal rupture carries a 30% risk of mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412469284">18</xref>
</sup> Imaging in both our patients showed no evidence of aneurysm or parenchymal abnormality of the gland suggesting that these patients probably had spontaneous rupture of the adrenal artery. However, such interpretation is uncertain as neither patient had undergone imaging prior to the retroperitoneal hemorrhage.</p>
<p>The surgical treatment for bleeding from an adrenal artery involves surgical ligation or resection of the aneurysm with or without resection of the involved gland.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412469284">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574412469284">20</xref>
</sup> Open surgical exploration for hemorrhage from an adrenal artery is similar to the approach used for renal trauma. The renal vessels are identified and clamped prior to opening of the renal fascia to explore the source of bleeding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574412469284">21</xref>
</sup> Surgical exploration often results in nephrectomy or adrenalectomy so as to minimize the operative time in a patient who may be hemodynamically unstable or unfit for prolonged anesthesia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574412469284">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Arteriography has been used as a diagnostic tool since the 1960s to determine the source of intra-abdominal bleeding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574412469284">23</xref>
</sup> The use of selective angiography to control and treat the source of bleeding was first described in the 1970s<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574412469284">24</xref>
</sup> and has become a widely accepted alternative to surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538574412469284">25</xref></sup> A number of different transcatheter techniques have been used to treat pseudoaneurysms that include embolization proximal to the pseudoaneurysm, embolization of the aneurysm neck, or embolization of the vessels both distal and proximal to the pseudoaneurysm (the isolation technique). Embolization of the aneurysm neck spares the parent artery; however, it is associated with a higher risk of rupture due to the fragility of the aneurysmal wall and migration of embolic materials. In comparison, embolization proximal to the pseudoaneurysm is technically easier, but may take a longer time to achieve due to refilling from collateral circulation and is therefore associated with a higher risk of rerupture. The isolation technique avoids these potential complications and has a high success rate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538574412469284">26</xref>
</sup> Embolization distal to the aneurysm sac was unnecessary in our patients as the adrenal artery is an end artery which precluded the risk of rerupture from arterial reperfusion.</p>
<p>Selective embolization to control bleeding from a visceral artery can be performed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538574412469284">27</xref>
</sup> or medically unfit for major abdominal surgery. It also allows preservation of any functional adrenal parenchyma and enables the patient to be stabilized, acting as a bridge to subsequent surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538574412469284">28</xref>
</sup> In our series, both patients underwent successful endovascular treatment of their adrenal artery pseudoaneurysm without surgery. Subsequent imaging confirmed no abnormalities of the adrenal gland and cessation of bleeding, suggesting that in a subset of patients adrenalectomy may be unnecessary if the source of bleeding has been controlled.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We describe the successful endovascular treatment of 2 patients presenting with spontaneous rupture of the adrenal artery. This approach enables organ preservation and control of bleeding without disruption of the retroperitoneal space thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this rare condition.</p>

<title>Context:</title>
<p>Pain is a commonly experienced and distressing symptom in women with breast cancer (BCA), and recent evidence suggests that immune activation may be associated with pain and other co-occurring symptoms. However, no studies to date have explored the relationships among perceived pain and biomarkers of inflammation in women with early-stage BCA during the initial course of treatment.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The purpose of this research study was to examine the relationships among pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and the presence of pain and other symptoms (anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disorder) prior to induction of chemotherapy.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Method:</title>
<p>This was a secondary analysis of data that measured perceived symptoms, including the presence of pain and pain interference, and plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) in women with early-stage BCA (<italic>N</italic> = 32) at 1 month postsurgery but prior to induction of chemotherapy.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Women experiencing pain had significantly higher levels of CRP (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), interleukin (IL) 13 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .02), and IL-7 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .02) and more pain interference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), depression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and sleep disturbance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) compared to women reporting no pain.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The presence of pain during the initial course of treatment in women with early-stage BCA was associated with significantly higher levels of CRP, IL-7, and IL-13, suggesting a potential role of immune activation in perceived pain. Further research to examine the precise effects of these biological factors in modulating pain is needed. Perceived pain was also associated with multiple co-occurring symptoms, and this finding has important implications for symptom management.</p></sec>

<body>
<p>Women in the early course of breast cancer (BCA) treatment commonly report adverse symptoms, and more than 54% experience moderate-to-severe pain during the treatment trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1099800411425857">van den Beuken-van Everdingen et al., 2007</xref>). Pain is one of the most frequently reported adverse sequalae of BCA surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411425857">Geller, Oppenheimer, Mickey, &amp; Worden, 2004</xref>) and the most frequent, intense, and distressful symptom after chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411425857">Byar, Berger, Bakken, &amp; Cetak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411425857">Rietman et al., 2004</xref>). Whether occurring as part of the disease process or as a side effect of treatment, pain is a significant problem for a majority of women with BCA and has a negative effect on quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411425857">Caffo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411425857">Miaskowski et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that immune activation modulated through the increased release of proinflammatory cytokines is a mechanism involved in the development of distressing symptoms for women with BCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411425857">Lyon, McCain, Walter, &amp; Schubert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411425857">Reyes-Gibby et al., 2008</xref>) including the generation of pain and hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1099800411425857">Sommer, 2006</xref>). Supporting a role for the immune system in symptom manifestation, investigators in several recent studies have reported associations among increased levels of interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance in BCA survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411425857">Collado-Hidalgo, Bower, Ganz, Cole, &amp; Irwin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1099800411425857">Starkweather, 2010</xref>). However, there have not been any published research studies focused on identifying biological factors associated with perceived pain early in the course of treatment, at a time when clinicians might employ potential therapeutics to prevent the occurrence of persistent symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411425857">Reyes-Gibby, Morrow, Buzdar, &amp; Shete, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, our initial step in this program of research was to focus on perceived pain during the early course of treatment. The purpose of this research study was to examine the relationships among pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers, perceived pain, and other symptoms (anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disorder) in women with early-stage (I-III) BCA, defined as 1month following BCA surgery (breast biopsy, lumpectomy, or mastectomy) but before the delivery of chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Perceived Pain in Women With Early-Stage BCA: A Review of the Literature</title>
<p>More than 200,000 women in the United States will receive diagnoses of BCA this year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411425857">Jemal, Siegal, Xu, &amp; Ward, 2010</xref>), and as part of the disease process and/or curative treatment, a majority of these women will experience pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1099800411425857">van den Beuken-van Everdingen et al., 2007</xref>). Multiple studies have shown that while women with BCA perceive benefit from their cancer treatment, they report problems with pain, functioning, and global quality of life, regardless of the type of surgical procedure or other treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411425857">Caffo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411425857">Montazeri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411425857">Schnur et al., 2007</xref>). The presence of pain during treatment for BCA is associated with persistent symptoms in survivorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411425857">Reyes-Gibby et al., 2009</xref>), which is of particular importance in this patient population, which is typically young and constitutes the largest group of cancer survivors in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411425857">Mantyh, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Women with BCA often report perceived pain along with other co-occurring symptoms, including depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411425857">Dodd, Miaskowski, &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411425857">Miaskowski et al., 2006</xref>). Although investigators have proposed that symptom clusters may share a common biological mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411425857">Cleeland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411425857">Fox &amp; Lyon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411425857">Fox, Lyon, &amp; Farace, 2007</xref>), very few studies have evaluated potential relationships among biological factors and BCA symptoms. Prior research incorporating biological factors has been limited to only a few select cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411425857">Bower et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411425857">Bower, Ganz, Aziz, &amp; Fahey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411425857">Collado-Hidalgo et al., 2006</xref>). While these studies have focused on one particular symptom, such as fatigue, no prior research has examined perceived pain and biological factors in women with early-stage BCA.</p>
<p>Biological factors, such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, are released by immune cells in response to a cancerous growth, and research has shown many of these same factors to function as pain modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411425857">Reyes-Gibby et al., 2009</xref>). Proinflammatory cytokines, in particular, can directly sensitize peripheral nerves, thereby lowering the pain transduction threshold, leading to peripheral sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1099800411425857">Sommer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1099800411425857">Watkins, Hutchinson, Milligan, &amp; Maier, 2007</xref>). IL-1 and IL-2 levels have been associated with pain response and variations in pain medication requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411425857">Backonja, Coe, Muller, &amp; Schell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411425857">Bessler, Shavit, Mayburd, Smirnov, &amp; Beilin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411425857">Finley, Happel, Kaminski, &amp; Rogers, 2008</xref>). IL-6 has an important role in neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411425857">Lee, Lee, Son, Hwang, &amp; Cho, 2004</xref>), while levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are associated with severity of pain in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411425857">Reyes-Gibby et al., 2008</xref>). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pain severity is associated with levels of C-reactive protein (CRP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411425857">Kojima et al., 2009</xref>). Although these studies suggest critical relationships among inflammatory biomarkers and perceived pain, to date there have not been any studies to examine pain—cytokine relationships in women with early-stage BCA.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study is a secondary analysis of baseline data from a research study carried out in two university health systems in the mid-Atlantic region, in September 2003–June 2006. We approached women diagnosed with Stages I-III BCA (<italic>N</italic> = 32) about study participation 1month following fine needle biopsy or breast tumor resection (lumpectomy or mastectomy). We selected this time point because it provided an adequate duration of time after surgery for return to baseline of immune parameters. Inclusion criteria were women over the age of 18 diagnosed with Stages I-III BCA and fluent in English. Exclusion criteria included a past medical history of another form of cancer or immune-related disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, HIV, lupus), recent symptoms of illness (cough and fever), or use of anxiolytics, antidepressants, or anti-inflammatory medications. All participants verbalized understanding and gave informed consent to the research protocol, which the university’s institutional review board had approved.</p>
<sec id="section3-1099800411425857">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>At the time of consent, we asked participants about demographic variables, including age, ethnicity, and menopausal status. Menopausal status was defined using the following categories: premenopausal, as having had a menstrual period within 3 months and no hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use or having had a hysterectomy with at least one ovary intact and no HRT use; perimenopausal, as having amenorrhea for at least 3 but less than 12 months and no current HRT use or having current HRT use for less than 1 year; postmenopausal, as having amenorrhea for at least 12 months or bilateral oopherectomy at least 6 months previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1099800411425857">Young, Finn, Austin, &amp; Peterson, 2003</xref>). Following the collection of demographic information, we asked participants to complete self-report questionnaires, including the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)–Short Form, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and General Sleep Disturbance scale (GSDS).</p>
<p>After participants completed the questionnaires, we collected a 10-mL blood sample from each woman using a standard phlebotomy protocol into a serum separator vacutainer without anticoagulant and transported the vial on ice directly to the laboratory for processing. Sera were separated by centrifugation, and all specimens were aliquoted immediately, frozen, and stored in a −70° C freezer until batch processing.</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<sec id="section6-1099800411425857">
<title>BPI–short form</title>
<p>This is a pain assessment tool that has well-established reliability and validity for adult patients with no cognitive impairment in studies of cancer and its symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411425857">Caraceni, 2001</xref>). The BPI assesses the severity of pain, location of pain, pain medications, amount of pain relief in the past 24 hr or the past week, and the impact of pain on daily functions. The estimated time for completion of the BPI is 5 min for the short form. In the present study, we used “worst pain” as a measure of pain severity and the arithmetic mean of the 7 interference items as a measure of pain interference. In widespread testing, the Cronbach’s α reliability has ranged from .70 to .91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411425857">Caraceni, 2001</xref>). The Cronbach’s α in this study was .89.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1099800411425857">
<title>HADS</title>
<p>The HADS is a brief, 14-item, self-report questionnaire developed to detect the presence and severity of both anxiety and depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099800411425857">Snaith, 2003</xref>). Because the HADS was developed for use in medically ill patients, it does not rely upon somatic symptoms of depression and anxiety such as pain and weight loss; instead, it focuses on cognitive symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents rate each question on a scale of 0–3, with a possible scores of 0–21 for the depression and anxiety subscales and a possible total score of 0–42. The HADS has well-established reliability and validity for both depression and anxiety in women with BCA. In this study, Cronbach’s α was .77 for the depression subscale and .81 for the anxiety subscale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1099800411425857">
<title>BFI</title>
<p>The BFI is a simple, 9-item scale that taps into a single dimension of fatigue severity and the interference fatigue creates in daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411425857">Mendoza et al., 1999</xref>). The BFI is a clinically validated tool used to assess cancer-related fatigue and its impact on daily functioning. The BFI uses simple numeric rating scales of 0–10 that are easily understood. Severe fatigue is defined as a score of 7 or higher. The BFI has demonstrated excellent reliability in clinical trials, with Cronbach’s α ranging from .82 to .97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411425857">Mendoza et al., 1999</xref>). The Cronbach’s α for the BFI in this study was .92.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1099800411425857">
<title>GSDS</title>
<p>The GSDS a 21-item tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411425857">Lee, Cho, Miaskowski, &amp; Dodd, 2004</xref>). In the present study, participants rated the frequency of sleep problems over the past week on a 0–7 scale (0 = <italic>never</italic> and 7 = <italic>every day</italic>). The GSDS has well-established reliability and validity and has demonstrated robust psychometric properties, particularly in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411425857">Miaskowski et al., 2006</xref>). In the current study, Cronbach’s α was .80.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1099800411425857">
<title>Measurement of biological factors</title>
<p>We measured plasma concentrations of cytokines with the Bio-Plex Human 17-Plex (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). This standardized kit includes coupled beads, detection antibodies, and standards for the detection of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, and TNF-α. After incubation, contents of each microplate well are drawn into the Bio-Plex array reader and precision fluidics align the beads in a single file through a flow cell, where two lasers excite the beads individually. High-speed digital signal processors and Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad) record the fluorescent signals simultaneously for each bead. We determined levels of CRP using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Sensitivity of all measurements = 10 pg/mL.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1099800411425857">
<title>Power Analysis</title>
<p>In this exploratory study, we sought to examine the relationships among pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and the presence of perceived pain and other symptoms. One approach to assessing the importance of correlations in the midst of multiplicity is to use the <italic>p</italic> value as a “cut-off value.” In these cases, the <italic>p</italic> value should be interpreted as defining a point at which a set cut-off value (such as .05) marks a correlation as “important.” Thus, a traditional power assessment would provide an indication of the size of the correlation that could be declared important. For a sample size of 32, a .05 two-sided Fisher’s <italic>z</italic> test of the null hypothesis with the correlation coefficient ρ = 0 will have an 80% power to detect a correlation as small as .45. Since correlations of .45 are of interest in this initial exploratory study, we estimated that a sample size of 32 participants would provide sufficient power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1099800411425857">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We computed descriptive statistics and correlations of pain and pain interference with symptom and biological factors overall and by type of surgery (biopsy, lumpectomy, or mastectomy). Due to nonnormality, we calculated Spearman rank rather than Pearson product–moment correlations. Further, because a reasonably large number of individuals experienced no pain (37.5%) or pain interference (48.4%), we also conducted analyses to determine any significant differences between symptom and biological factors by pain and pain interference status. We stratified the samples into pain groups: those experiencing no pain versus those experiencing some pain. Separately, we stratified them by pain interference groups: those experiencing no pain interference versus those experiencing some pain interference. We examined significant differences in symptom and biological factors between groupings. For nonnormally distributed variables, we used the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test to test for significant differences between those with and without pain and separately for those with and without pain interference. Otherwise we conducted independent <italic>t</italic> tests with post hoc tests applied as necessary to correct for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>We examined differences in study variables by type of surgery (biopsy, lumpectomy, or mastectomy) using either nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) for normally distributed variables. We further examined effects on study variables in general linear models by pain groupings (either by those experiencing pain or no pain or by those experiencing pain interference or no pain interference) using type of surgery as a covariate. We reported least square means for significant differences in pain or pain interference groupings. Finally, we examined partial Spearman correlations between study variables and continuous measures of pain and pain interference using type of surgery as a covariate. We conducted all analyses in statistical analysis system v9.2 and assumed an α = .05 level of significance.</p>

<p>Overall Spearman correlations revealed significant positive relationships among pain, pain interference, and other symptoms. There were significant positive associations between pain and depression (<italic>r</italic>s = .61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and sleep disturbances (<italic>r</italic>s = .50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).

Among the biological factors, only IL-13 (<italic>r</italic>s = .40, <italic>p</italic> = .02) and CRP (<italic>r</italic>s = .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were significantly and positively correlated with pain, and IL-7 (<italic>r</italic>s = .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02) and CRP (<italic>r</italic>s = 0.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were significantly and positively correlated with pain interference.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this sample of women with early-stage BCA 1 month following breast biopsy or tumor resection but prior to delivery of chemotherapy, 62.5% reported the presence of pain and 53.1% reported the presence of pain interference. The presence of pain was positively and significantly associated with symptoms of depression and sleep disturbance, while pain interference was significantly and positively related to all the symptoms: anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. These findings suggest that when pain interferes with functioning in women with BCA, a greater number of co-occurring symptoms are likely to be present. Women experiencing pain or pain interference were not only more likely to report co-occurring symptoms, they had more severe symptoms.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for both practice and research. The high number of women who reported perceived pain and/or pain interference informs clinicians that they should perform routine assessment and evaluation of pain, pain severity, and pain interference, even in the early course of BCA treatment. The findings also suggest that women who report perceived pain/pain interference should be assessed for other co-occurring symptoms, as they are more likely to be present, and more severe, than for women who do not report pain.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an association among perceived pain, pain interference, and increased levels of CRP, IL-13, and IL-7 among women undergoing early management of BCA. While the cross-sectional nature of this study makes it impossible to infer any causal relationships, there is evidence that these biological factors are involved in other painful disorders. For instance, research has implicated CRP, IL-7, and IL-13 in modulating pain sensitivity among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411425857">Horwood, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411425857">Kojima et al., 2009</xref>), as well as in experimental pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411425857">Angst et al., 2007</xref>). Whether increased levels of these biological factors have any direct effect in modulating pain pathways remains unclear, although similar patterns of immune response have been demonstrated in animal models of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411425857">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411425857">Rittner &amp; Brack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1099800411425857">Zhang &amp; An, 2007</xref>). Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify the signaling pathways and functional effects of elevated CRP, IL-7, and IL-13 in women with early-stage BCA. Future research focused on genetic regulation of immune reactivity could provide a more comprehensive view of the relationships between cytokines and symptom manifestation, and indeed, this work is already moving forward in BCA survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411425857">Collado-Hidalgo, Bower, Ganz, Irwin, &amp; Cole, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Analyses among the different types of BCA surgery revealed that women who underwent a breast biopsy had more severe symptoms compared to women who received breast tumor resection (lumpectomy or mastectomy). In contrast, women who underwent lumpectomy had significantly less pain, pain interference, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance than the breast biopsy or mastectomy groups. These findings suggest that perceived pain and other adverse symptoms are not related to the extent of BCA surgery, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411425857">Caffo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411425857">Montazeri et al., 2008</xref>). Presurgical distress and expectancies of pain and fatigue have been found to predict postsurgical pain and fatigue in women with BCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411425857">Schnur et al., 2007</xref>). While the small sample sizes of each surgical subgroup likely affected our ability to detect significant differences among other cytokine levels, these preliminary results provide some support of altered pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines levels at 1 month postsurgery. Future research to examine changes in cytokine levels from pre- to postoperative status, along with measurement of psychological distress and symptom expectancies would be informative in clarifying the role of these biological factors in the symptom experience of women with early-stage BCA during the initial course of treatment.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We should discuss several limitations of this secondary analysis: Most notably, the small sample size and cross-sectional descriptive design that make it impossible to infer any cause–effect relationships between perceived pain and the biological factors we measured. In addition, although we questioned participants about recent symptoms of illness or exposure to illness and other cofactors (e.g., menopausal status) that can affect cytokine levels, there may have been additional conditions or events for which we did not control or account during data collection or analysis, such as psychological distress or symptom expectancies. Finally, because of the limited publications on multiple cytokine levels at 1 month post-BCA surgery, there were no data against which we could make comparisons. Although altered levels of cytokines have been associated with adverse symptoms in patients with other types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411425857">Reyes-Gibby et al., 2008</xref>), the effects remain unclear and may differ according to individual characteristics, such as genetic factors, cancer type, and treatment modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411425857">Seruga, Zhang, Bernstein, &amp; Tannock, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this secondary analysis, a high percentage of women with early-stage BCA reported perceived pain and/or pain interference 1 month postsurgery but before induction of chemotherapy. Women who reported perceived pain and/or pain interference had greater severity of multiple co-occurring symptoms in comparison to women without pain. The findings of this secondary analysis extend previous research by demonstrating alterations in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, regardless of the type of surgery (breast biopsy, lumpectomy, and mastectomy). This study is also the first to report a positive association among perceived pain, CRP, and IL-13 at 1 month postsurgery in women with early-stage BCA. More research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the functional effects of elevated CRP and IL-13 on pain modulation. The study findings support the need for assessment of perceived pain and pain interference during the initial course of early-stage BCA treatment and suggest that women who do experience perceived pain are more likely to have more severe depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance than women without pain.</p>

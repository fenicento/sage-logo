<abstract>
<p>Growth failure is nearly universal in spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and common in type 2, although acuity is often underappreciated at initial diagnosis. We reviewed 44 consecutive spinal muscular atrophy patients (28 type 1, 16 type 2) under 3 years at initial presentation. Growth failure was conventionally defined: weight below the fifth percentile or dropping 2 major percentiles over 6 months. Growth failure differed among subjects stratified by age at disease onset using the Kaplan-Meier method (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011). Median time to growth failure among subjects with onset between 0 to 3 months of age was 5 months; Only 1 of 22 avoided failure by 22 months of age. Median time to failure with disease onset between 4 to 6 months was 15 months. Most late onset (&gt; 6 months) subjects avoided growth failure. Early clinical symptoms predict feeding dysfunction and growth failure. Immediate, proactive nutritional intervention is indicated for patients with early symptom onset.</p>

<body>
<p>Spinal muscular atrophy is a progressive, recessively inherited, presently untreatable neurodegenerative disease characterized by weakness and muscle atrophy caused by the loss of spinal cord motor neurons. Children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (Werdnig-Hoffman disease),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811415680">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811415680">2</xref>
</sup> and to a lesser extent spinal muscular atrophy type 2 (an intermediate category of patients who gain the ability to sit but not walk independently),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811415680">3</xref>
</sup> have traditionally experienced severe morbidity related to poor pulmonary function and nutritional deficiencies, and early morbidity and mortality in the first few years of life.</p>
<p>Management relies on supportive care to address disease complications and maximize clinical and motor function. In the published standard of care for clinical management in spinal muscular atrophy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811415680">4</xref>
</sup> nutrition was recognized as an area of critical importance despite limited study. Aggressive nutritional supplementation, particularly placement of a gastrostomy tube to mitigate malnutrition, is thought to be partly responsible, along with advances in pulmonary care and physical therapy, for the improved mortality that has been noted among children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 in recent years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811415680">5</xref>
</sup> In their survival analysis of historical cohorts, Oskoui and colleagues noted a significant reduction in hazard ratio (0.5) among children with type 1 disease who received gastrostomy placement compared with those not similarly managed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811415680">5</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, although feeding failure is felt to be nearly universally expected among children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and common among weaker children with type 2 disease, studies that address factors that predict the development and timing of feeding failure and resultant malnutrition are lacking.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811415680">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Improved understanding of the development of growth failure in spinal muscular atrophy, and factors that help predict growth failure, would be of immense benefit in optimizing the institution of appropriate clinical care. Better nutritional care could potentially lead to further improvements in the morbidity and mortality of this disease. We postulate that disease severity, defined by both classical disease schema (type 1 vs type 2) as well as by age of disease onset (before 3 months, 3-6 months, beyond 6 months), will be associated with more rapid development of growth failure among infants and young children (aged 0-3 years) with spinal muscular atrophy. We proposed to study the development of clinically defined growth failure among a relatively large convenience sample of young children with spinal muscular atrophy types 1 and 2 who have received care at the Pediatric Neuromuscular Center at Columbia University Medical Center, a large tertiary hospital in New York City.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073811415680">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Medical records of all consecutive patients who received care at the Pediatric Neuromuscular Disease Center at Columbia University Medical Center between January 1, 2002 and July 1, 2010; with the diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy types 1 and 2; and were under the age of 3 years at the time of initial evaluation were included for retrospective review. All included patients carry a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy based on clinical features consistent with the diagnosis and confirmatory molecular testing demonstrating a homozygous mutation of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene. Disease type classification (type 1 or 2) was based on conventional definitions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811415680">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811415680">4</xref>
</sup> De-identified data including sex, spinal muscular atrophy type, dietary history, and gastrointestinal complaints were obtained, as were all available anthropometric measures (height, weight, head circumference, sex) for included subjects through their seventh birthdays. All components of the study were approved by the Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Board and were followed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 1983.</p>
<p>Forty-four subjects met criteria for enrollment. This cohort included 26 boys and 18 girls, ages 1 to 33 months (mean 10 months) at the time of initial measure. Twenty-eight carried a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy type 1, and 16 had a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy type 2. Thirty-three (75%) white, 3 African-American, 9 Hispanic, and 1 Asian were included in the cohort. Twenty-nine subjects were included from an ongoing clinical study of spinal muscular atrophy, whereas the remaining 15 subjects were drawn from current and historical patients who have received medical care through the neuromuscular center. The former group, in particular, is a well-described, genetically characterized cohort of patients for whom a battery of clinical, demographic, and anthropometric data has been recorded on an ongoing basis as part of scheduled follow-up assessments and care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0883073811415680">
<title>Anthropometrics</title>
<p>Weight and available demographic and clinical data were obtained via retrospective chart review of documents associated with ongoing clinical care. For subjects followed under the clinical study of spinal muscular atrophy protocol (n = 29), anthropometric measures were obtained by consistent, standardized procedures. Subjects were weighed on a standard infant scale if size appropriate. If the child was too large for this scale, weight of the subject and the wheelchair was obtained to the nearest kilogram using a wheelchair balance scale (Pelstar, Bridgeview Il) with the subject in the wheelchair. Then the wheelchair was weighed by itself and subtracted from the total weight. Although the measurement methods are not defined for routine clinical care, they typically followed a protocol similar to that described above for the research protocol.</p>

<sec id="section4-0883073811415680">
<title>Assignment of Percentiles/z Scores</title>
<p>Age- and sex-specific weight percentiles, developed by the Centers for Disease Control through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988-1994),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811415680">6</xref>
</sup> were used to assign percentiles (<italic>z</italic> scores) using defined methods based on this extensive cohort of 33 994 healthy volunteers, aged 2 months to 80 years, to study participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883073811415680">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Survival data were censored on January 1, 2011. We dichotomized the sample by spinal muscular atrophy type classification (type 1 or type 2), using accepted and standardized disease definitions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811415680">3</xref>
</sup> Type 1 describes children who never gain the ability to sit without support. Type 2 describes children who are able to sit but not walk independently at the point of greatest function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811415680">3</xref>
</sup> We also categorized the sample based on age at disease onset (0-3 months, 4-6 months, &gt; 6 months of age) based on documentation of the age at which initial symptoms were recognized by parents as recorded during the child’s initial patient evaluation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival probabilities and plot survival curves of patients from age of symptom onset. A log-rank test was used to compare avoidance of growth failure between cohorts. These analyses were conducted using a censoring outcome of growth failure based on conventional definitions: (1) weight below fifth percentile on Centers for Disease Control growth charts (based on NHANES III dataset); or (2) decreased growth velocity resulting in weight falling &gt; 2 major percentiles (third, fifth, 10th, 25th, 50th) over a 6-month period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811415680">7</xref>
</sup> For subjects who underwent placement of a gastrostomy (feeding) tube to provide nutritional supplementation prior to reaching the primary censoring outcome, data were censored at the time of surgery. For subjects who did not develop feeding failure, data were censored at the time of last available clinical record. For subjects with long-term follow-up without reaching the primary censoring outcome (growth failure), data were censored at 36 months from disease onset.</p>
<p>Two analyses were performed. The first used the above Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test to compare subjects with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 to those with type 2 disease. This same approach was then applied to calculate survival probabilities and plot survival curves based on categorized age of initial reported symptom onset (0-3 months vs 4-6 months vs &gt; 6 months). The log rank test was used to compare the development of growth failure across the 3 groups. This (categorical) comparison of growth failure by age of disease onset was the primary analysis of the study. For group comparisons presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811415680">Tables 1</xref>
 and 2
 (see the following), appropriate test statistics (Student <italic>t</italic> test or chi-square test) were applied. A 2-sided .05 level of significance was used in all analyses. Given 22 subjects with early onset (0-3 months) and 22 subjects with onset either between 4-6 months or after 6 months of age, the study had an approximately 80% power to detect an 8-month difference in survival to event. In the context of clinical care, a smaller difference of 4 to 5 months would be meaningful in driving expectations regarding the rapidity of onset of growth failure and commensurate urgency of medical intervention. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, Release date March 2008).</p>

<title>Demographics and Description of Cohort</title>
<p>The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 44 patients who met inclusion criteria are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811415680">Table 1</xref>. Data were available for analysis from 188 visits. Of the total cohort, 22 (19 type 1 and 3 type 2) ultimately underwent placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube to alleviate inability to effectively feed. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811415680">Table 1</xref>, there were statistically significant differences across many demographic and clinical measures between subjects with type 1 and 2 disease, and between subjects based on age of onset (0-3 months, 4-6 months, and after 6 months of age). Subjects with type 2 disease experienced later disease onset and had superior clinical function. Far fewer spinal muscular atrophy type 2 subjects required ventilatory or invasive nutritional support (gastrostomy) compared with subjects with spinal muscular atrophy type 1. Subjects with early onset (0-3 months) were almost universally classified as type 1, although 2 of the 22 subjects in this cohort ultimately developed the ability to sit unsupported and therefore were classified as having spinal muscular atrophy type 2. Seven of 15 subjects (53%) with onset between 4 and 6 months were ultimately classified as having spinal muscular atrophy type 2. All subjects with disease onset after 6 months were classified as having spinal muscular atrophy type 2.</p>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811415680">Table 2</xref>, subjects who experienced growth failure experienced earlier age of onset (3.7 ± 3.1 vs 4.7 ± 3.2 months, <italic>P</italic> = .30) and were more likely to manifest more severe disease (73% vs 55% with spinal muscular atrophy type 1, <italic>P</italic> = .40) compared with those who did not develop growth failure. This group also had increased ventilatory requirements (17/22 vs 12/22, <italic>P</italic> = .11) compared with those who did not experience growth failure. Also described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811415680">Table 2</xref> are subjects with early gastrostomy placement (prior to the development of clinically defined growth failure) and short follow-up (&lt; 12 months from disease onset) who failed to reach the primary censoring outcome (growth failure). Subjects in the 2 former groups were overwhelmingly affected by type 1 disease (11/12 vs 1/10) and had earlier disease onset compared with other subjects who did not develop growth failure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we describe the development of clinically defined growth failure among young children with severe spinal muscular atrophy. Among such patients, swallowing dysfunction is a common complication that often requires intervention in the form of gastrostomy placement. Unfortunately, the acuity and rapidity of onset of growth failure is often underappreciated at the time of initial diagnosis, potentially leading to delays in the implementation of optimal care. We observed a median time to growth failure of only 5 months among subjects who presented with initial symptoms between birth to 3 months of age. Only 1 of 22 such subjects avoided growth failure (or preemptive gastrostomy placement) by 22 months of age. Among children with later disease onset (between 4-6 months), growth failure was a less precipitous and less universal complication, with a 15-month median time to failure. Most late onset (&gt; 6 months) subjects avoided growth failure. Observations from this small, retrospective cohort suggest that early clinical symptoms (before 4 months of age) may predict rapid onset of feeding dysfunction and growth failure, with important implications for clinical care and intervention. There are some methodological issues, however, that have an impact on the strength and validity of the reported observations.</p>
<p>The external validity of the study to the broader spinal muscular atrophy population may be affected by aspects of the specific sample population studied. This was a retrospective study drawn from 2 convenience samples available at a large, research-oriented, tertiary care center in New York City: (1) an ongoing natural history study of spinal muscular atrophy; and (2) available clinical records from patients who sought care at the center but who did not elect to enroll in the natural history study. It is possible that such subjects differ in unpredictable ways from the general spinal muscular atrophy population, particularly when applied to non-American populations. Parents of enrollees in clinical studies, particularly natural history studies, may be more aggressive in health maintenance and using interventions to support their children. Experienced nutritional and comprehensive medical care was also provided to all subjects followed at the center; this care also may impact the development and management of malnutrition in unforeseen ways, further limiting the external validity of the results.</p>
<p>The internal validity of the study may be compromised by differential dropout across the study cohort. Data are incomplete on several subjects with severe clinical phenotypes who were seen at the center early in the observation period (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811415680">Table 2</xref>). The choice of a Kaplan-Meier approach was made to limit the potential bias of such early dropouts on the data analysis. Although it is possible that the availability of more complete clinical records from these subjects would alter the strength of observations in this study, these subjects were as a group severely ill and in all likelihood experienced severe early morbidity, including development of growth failure and malnutrition, and mortality related to the disease. Four subjects underwent gastrostomy placement prior to development of growth failure. To avoid confounding our results, censoring of data at the time of gastrostomy placement was necessary given that such subjects were unlikely to experience growth failure following this intervention,. Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine the rationale behind gastrostomy placement in these and many other cases; in many cases, clinical expectations of growth failure among severely affected children may result in preemptive gastrostomy placement.</p>
<p>The use of retrospective chart review also introduces the potential for recall bias, with earlier disease onset recalled by caregivers of children with ultimately more severe disease; this may be a particularly relevant concern among subjects who were referred to the center for research purposes and did not receive initial care at our medical center. The designation of growth failure was based on conventional definitions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811415680">7</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, such definitions are based on population norms developed among otherwise healthy children and may not fully apply to the study of children with neuromuscular diseases marked by severe muscle wasting such as spinal muscular atrophy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811415680">4</xref>
</sup>; the use of such conventional definitions of growth failure may lead to an overestimation of growth failure in this population, as has been seen in studies of older children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy types 2 and 3.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811415680">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811415680">9</xref>
</sup> There is no clearly superior alternative method for defining growth failure in this population, however, nor is it clear that the development of weight loss (or failure to gain) during the first years of life should be regarded as an expected, accepted manifestation of muscle atrophy rather than a marker of secondary complications (malnutrition) of the disease. The role of swallowing function, and dysfunction, in driving the need for gastrostomy was also not addressed in this study. Clearly, a systematic, prospective approach assessing nutritional inputs, nutritional balance, and swallowing function over time is needed to more effectively address questions regarding the role and timing of nutritional intervention in clinical care for patients with spinal muscular atrophy.</p>
<p>This approach is particularly important, as growth failure, resulting from swallowing dysfunction and resulting diminished caloric intake, is a nearly universal complication of care of patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1, and a frequent complication among weaker patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2. Appropriate nutritional management is necessary to optimize clinical outcomes. Many of these children develop severe and early swallowing dysfunction that predisposes to not just the development of feeding impairment (with resulting negative caloric balance and ultimate malnutrition), but also risk of aspiration.<sup>

</sup> Although there is a diversity of opinion regarding the ethics of aggressive clinical practice in the care of children with spinal muscular atrophy (especially for children with type 1 disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811415680">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811415680">11</xref>
</sup>), placement of a gastrostomy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811415680">4</xref>
</sup> or gastrojejunal tube<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811415680">12</xref>
</sup> for parenteral nutrition has become increasingly standard therapy, particularly in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811415680">5</xref>
</sup> Nutrition, although traditionally understudied in neuromuscular diseases in general, and spinal muscular atrophy in particular,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811415680">4</xref>
</sup> has gained increased attention following a recent study of Trichostatin A and nutrition in a spinal muscular atrophy mouse model that suggested that nutritional supplementation can positively alter the effectiveness of pharmacological therapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811415680">13</xref>
</sup> The prospect of potential therapeutic advances on the near horizon places additional emphasis on the standardization and optimization of clinical management for this disease, particularly for children with severe clinical phenotypes. However, what is defined as optimal nutritional management in spinal muscular atrophy remains woefully unclear.</p>
<p>The urgency and need for rapid and effective nutritional support is often not immediately apparent early in the disease course, which potentially leads to delays in needed interventions such as increased caloric content of formulas or gastrostomy placement. Not surprisingly, this study demonstrated a significant difference in the development of growth failure between subjects with type 1 and type 2 disease, consistent with widespread clinical experience in the management of severe spinal muscular atrophy. Children in this study with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 were at high risk for growth failure, typically within the first year of life. This finding suggests that such children should be followed very closely for the development of swallowing dysfunction and malnutrition, and preventative, anticipatory implementation of gastrostomy should be considered. Although categorization based on maximal clinical function (ability to independently maintain a sitting position) is a rational approach, such categorization necessarily obscures often dramatic differences in disease severity, and resultant morbidity and mortality, within a common disease classification. Clinical needs, and therefore clinical management, often differ markedly between high- and low-functioning patients within the same disease classification. More importantly, the ultimate clinical diagnostic classification is often initially unclear. For all of these reasons, the identification of clinical features available at the time of initial presentation that would guide prognosis and management of growth failure are of immense importance in the optimization of clinical care for this disease.</p>
<p>Assessing 1 such feature, parent-reported age of initial symptom onset, this study suggests that early development of clinical symptoms (particularly before 4 months of age) predicts a high risk for early and often precipitous feeding failure. Among these typically severely affected children, half developed growth failure by 7 months of age and nearly all ultimately required gastrostomy or nutritional support by 2 years of age, unless preceded by death from other causes (respiratory illnesses, ventilatory failure, etc). This finding contrasted sharply with children with later onset. For those with onset between 4 and 6 months, median age at growth failure was approximately 20 months, with one-third of the cohort avoiding the development of growth failure and consequent need of gastrostomy. Most children with onset after 6 months of age did not develop growth failure over the observation period. These data suggest that age of symptom onset may be a valuable clinical tool in assessing risk of feeding failure; they also suggest the importance of immediate discussion of nutritional intervention for children with spinal muscular atrophy who present with symptoms within the first few months of life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this retrospective chart review of growth among children with spinal muscular atrophy suggests that immediate, proactive nutritional intervention is particularly indicated for those with early symptom onset, and it emphasizes that proactive nutritional care should be a high priority from the moment of diagnosis among such patients to optimally mitigate complications related to early malnutrition and growth failure. This study also further emphasizes the immense need for comprehensive, prospective studies of nutrition and nutritional interventions in the management of patients with spinal muscular atrophy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) known as an agent causing stress in rats. PAHs, such as petroleum and petroleum derivatives, are widespread organic pollutans originated from oil spills and incomplete combustion of fossil fuels at the environment. Since most PAHs are persistent in the environment for a longer period of time, their bioaccumulation causes environmental pollution and affects biological equilibrium drastically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711432575">Demir and Demirbag, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711432575">Gaspare et al., 2009</xref>), with the potential for biological damage as demonstrated by the toxic effect of DMBA-induced stress in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711432575">Sun, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>When the natural protective systems against reactive oxygen species (ROS) are exhausted, exogenous antioxidative compounds must be delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711432575">Shadab et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the search for new antioxidants as potential drugs is an active field of medicinal chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711432575">Devillers et al., 2001</xref>). Selenium is an essential element having physiological nonenzymatic antioxidant properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711432575">Nogueira et al., 2003</xref>). Because of the health problems induced by environmental pollutants, the antioxidant potential of selenium is the subject of intensive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711432575">El-Demerdash, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) comprises a family of enzymes known as the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. The enzyme is an iron-containing mixed function oxidase that requires a reduced pterin cofactor and molecular oxygen. TH activity is controlled by negative feedback in catecholamine biosynthesis. Many inducers of stress have been shown to increase TH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711432575">Tumer et al., 1992</xref>). Constant cold exposure, hypertension, neurochemical alterations, aging and antihypertensive drug treatments increase TH activity in the adrenal medulla and sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711432575">Tumer et al., 1992</xref>). Dopamine, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine are catecholamines synthesized from tyrosine amino acid. TH is thought to be a rate-limiting enzyme in biosynthesis of catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711432575">Tumer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711432575">Yurekli, 1998</xref>). The synthesis and release of catecholamines take place in brain, kromaffin cells, sympathetic ganglia and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711432575">Tumer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711432575">Yurekli, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Adrenomedullin (ADM) was discovered and isolated from human pheochromocytoma extracts. This 52-amino-acid peptide was observed to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in a platelet bioassay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711432575">Romppanen et al., 1997</xref>). ADM is a multifunctional peptide and elevated ADM levels have been observed under multiple pathologic situations such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Accumulating evidence suggests that ADM has beneficial effects against pathological changes in these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711432575">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). While ADM is rich in pheochromocytoma, the peptide is also abundant in normal tissues such as adrenal medulla, lungs, kidneys and heart. Besides having confirmed, plasma ADM is elevated in certain disease conditions such as essential hypertension, chronic renal failure, chronic idiopathic glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy; ADM has an intimate relationship with the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711432575">Mak et al., 2006</xref>). ADM was originally discovered as a vasodilative peptide, but recent studies have revealed its pleiotropic effects as demonstrated in ADM knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711432575">Shimosawa and Fujita, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Synthetic organoselenium compounds can be tailored to achieve greater chemopreventive efficacy with minimal toxic side effects by structural modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711432575">Ozdemir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711432575">Talas et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711432575">2009</xref>). Therefore, we undertook the present study to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of Se I and Se II in the well-established DMBA-treated rat model by monitoring the TH activity, ADM and total RNA levels in adrenal medulla.</p>

<title>Experimental groups</title>
<p>In this study, 35 healthy female Albino Wistar rats (body weight 180–200 g, 3–4 months old) were divided into five groups, each having six to eight animals. Each rat was weighed just before the start of the study. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally. DMBA was dissolved in corn oil and rats were injected with 50 mg/kg body weight. Se I and Se II were dissolved in corn oil and rats were injected with 25 µmol/kg. Animals in group I were used as control. Animals in group II received only the vehicle solution, i.e. corn oil at 2 days intervals for 4 weeks. Animals in group III were given a single dose of 50 mg/kg DMBA and were killed 4 weeks later. Rats in group IV received DMBA as in group III, but after 6 h of DMBA application Se I was administered at 25 µmol/kg at 2 days interval for 4 weeks. Animals in group V were treated exactly as in group IV, except that Se II was used instead of Se I.</p>
<p>The ethical rules raised by <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711432575">Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, 1996</xref>) were obeyed during this study, which was closely scrutinized by ethical commission of Medicine School of Inonu University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233711432575">
<title>Preparation of tissues for analysis</title>
<p>After the treatments, rats were anesthetized with 75 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, chests were opened, vena cava was cut and 30 ml of 0.9% NaCl was injected into the heart to rinse blood from the body. The adrenal medulla was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were stored at −180°C until used. Tissues were weighed and then homogenized in 100 ml of 2 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Homogenates were used for determination of total protein, measurement of TH activity, ADM and total RNA level.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of DMBA and synthetic organoselenium compounds on TH activity, ADM and total RNA levels.</p>
<p>TH activity in the adrenal glands increased in the DMBA-exposed groups but Se I and Se II prevented this DMBA-induced enhanced stress. It was reported that stress increases TH activity and biosynthesis, which is known to affect the adrenergic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711432575">Talas and Yurekli, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it would appear that DMBA elevates biosynthesis of catecholamines and the increased TH enzyme activity is blocked by Se I and Se II. The positive effect of synthetic organoselenium compounds in DMBA-exposed animals may be related to a reduction in TH activity. The data presented suggest that synthetic organoselenium compounds may play an important role in maintaining homeostasis as an antagonist substance against enhanced TH activity. In cells that synthesize and secrete dopamine, NE and epinephrine, the neurotransmitter levels are precisely controlled through the regulation of TH, the rate-limiting enzyme, in this neurotransmitter biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711432575">Reynolds, 1996</xref>). It can be hypothesized that if TH activity increases, catecholamine production can also increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711432575">Wang et al., 1995</xref>). The precise mechanism for this effect is not clear, but one possibility is that the synthetic organoselenium compounds reduce vein pressure, thus blocking the increase in TH activity.</p>
<p>ADM was originally discovered as a vasodilative peptide, but recent studies have revealed its pleiotropic effects. Through its antioxidative effect, ADM can protect organs from damage induced by high blood pressure, ischemia and aging. This indicates that antioxidants that can inhibit ROS production but do not have a scavenging effect could be a new effective therapeutic target for organ protection in hypertension as well as metabolic syndrome, in which higher oxidative stress plays a pivotal role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711432575">Shimosawa and Fujita, 2005</xref>). ADM plays important roles in cardiovascular and renal diseases via modulation of oxidative stress condition. These data provide important insights into the action of ADM as an antioxidant in protecting cardiovascular and renal dysfunction induced by hypertension, salt loading, vascular injury, diabetes and ischemia–reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711432575">Chao and Chao, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>ADM has been shown to protect against ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711432575">Xia et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, ADM has differential effects on cellular metabolism, immune function, endocrine function and cardiovascular function. This peptide appears to play a pivotal role in both reprioritizing the biological needs of tissues and organs during the three phases of inflammatory response as well as a role in restoring homeostatic equilibrium to the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711432575">Elsasser and Kahl, 2002</xref>). In addition to the vasodilating effect, ADM has diuretic and natriuretic actions, which are mediated by an increase in glomerular filtration rate and a decrease in distal tubular sodium reabsorption. Clinically, plasma ADM levels are increased in patients with chronic renal failure. Current observations suggest that ADM plays an important role in renal regulation including fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711432575">Jougasaki and Burnett, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>ADM levels were increased in the adrenal medulla of rats exposed to DMBA. ADM levels in adrenal medulla of rats treated with Se I and Se II demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in comparison with DMBA group. These results indicate that increased ADM levels play important roles in the adrenal medulla of rat by suppression of stress or stress-induced damage. These findings provide important insights into the action of ADM as antioxidant and antihypertensive agents in protecting DMBA-induced stress.</p>
<p>Total RNA levels were found to be significantly increased by the effect of DMBA in adrenal medulla of rats. This increase in total RNA levels were inhibited in Se I- and Se II-treated rat adrenal medulla. This is the first report showing that the synthetic organoselenium compounds can block the increase in the total RNA levels in the adrenal medulla of DMBA-exposed rats. Total RNA levels were determined to obtain preliminary information about the synthesis of enzymes that play critical roles in the control of stress hormone secretion.</p>
<p>The present study demonstrates that synthetic organoselenium compounds can suppress DMBA-induced stress-related changes in the adrenal medulla of rats. Results of this study are in well accordance with the previously reported investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711432575">Ozdemir et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711432575">Talas et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the antioxidant and antihypertensive effects of Se I and Se II may have important effects in the maintainance of homeostasis.</p>

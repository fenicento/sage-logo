<abstract>
<p>Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is currently the most accurate staging modality for lymph node metastases in prostate adenocarcinoma. There is no consensus on the optimal sampling method of PLND specimens among pathologists. This study analyzed the effectiveness of the submission of entire adipose tissue in 451 cases and its impact on total lymph node yield and detection of positive lymph nodes. The sizes of metastatic foci and positive lymph nodes in 83 cases were also studied. Submission of entire adipose tissue increased the lymph node yield and positive lymph node detection by 36.7 % and 1.99 %, respectively. Three cases had positive lymph nodes exclusively in adipose tissue. Of the patients examined, 68% had the largest positive lymph node, &lt;1 cm. In conclusion, it was noted that metastases from prostate cancer were frequently small and seen within small lymph nodes. Submission of entire adipose tissue substantially increased the lymph node yield, but its impact on the detection of additional positive lymph nodes was low. Submission of the entire adipose tissue may be considered as an option in patients with high-risk factors for lymph node metastases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lymph node status is a major decisive factor in terms of prognosis and therapy in prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912445921">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912445921"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912445921">3</xref></sup> Imaging assessment of lymph node status based on size and shape is unable to detect smaller metastasis, and large lymph nodes can be diagnosed as false-positive in cases of focal lipomatosis, reactive hyperplasia, or inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912445921">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912445921">5</xref></sup> Thus, pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and subsequent pathologic evaluation is currently the most accurate staging modality for the detection of lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445921">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912445921">7</xref></sup> In the prostate specific antigen (PSA) era, the stage has migrated downward, and the incidence of nodal metastases has decreased because of earlier detection of prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912445921">8</xref></sup> However, the incidence of finding a positive lymph node may increase with the recent changes in the extent of PLND and the manner of pathologic evaluation of the submitted tissue specimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912445921">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912445921"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912445921"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912445921"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912445921">13</xref></sup> Currently, the indication and extent of PLND in prostate cancer are still controversial among urologists, and the number of lymph nodes retrieved varies widely among different centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912445921">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912445921"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912445921">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, from the pathologic perspective, there is no consensus on the optimal sampling method for PLND specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912445921">14</xref></sup> Only isolated reports are available regarding the optimal sampling method of PLND for pathological examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912445921">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912445921"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912445921">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, our aim was to assess the benefits in processing the entire adipose tissue packet submitted as pelvic lymph nodes and evaluate its impact on the lymph node yield and the final N stage of the TNM staging scheme for prostate cancer. To give us a better perspective, we also looked at multiple parameters, such as the size of the largest lymph node, sizes of positive lymph nodes, and sizes of metastatic deposits within the lymph nodes.</p>

<sec id="section2-1066896912445921" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed pathology records of patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with PLND at Henry Ford Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010. The parameters analyzed were as follows: total number of lymph nodes in the dissection, size of the largest lymph node, size of the largest lymph node with metastasis, and size of the largest metastatic focus measured according to the recommendations of the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912445921">14</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1066896912445921">
<title>Modified Protocol</title>
<p>In 2010, the protocol for the submission of PLND specimens for pathologic microscopic examination was modified. In the new protocol, the remainder of the adipose tissue was blocked separately, after submission of palpable and grossly visible lymph nodes, and recorded in the descriptive part of the report. It was processed by routine processing without the use of fat-clearing techniques. The following parameters were analyzed in the cases submitted by the modified protocol: the number of additional lymph nodes identified, the number and sizes of positive lymph nodes in this additional adipose tissue, and the number of cases in which submission of the remainder of the adipose tissue affected the N stage of the TNM staging scheme.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From 2008 to 2010, we identified a total of 1517 cases of RARP with PLND. These included 83 cases with pelvic lymph node metastases. In 451 out of 1517 cases, entire adipose tissue was processed for microscopic evaluation according to the modified protocol. Forty-two cases with pelvic lymph node metastases had the entire adipose tissue submitted.</p>
<sec id="section5-1066896912445921">
<title>Characteristics of Lymph Nodes</title>
<p>Of the 83 cases with positive lymph nodes, a total of 1029 lymph nodes were submitted for histologic evaluation and 175 lymph nodes were positive for metastases. The mean number of positive lymph nodes was 2.1 (median = 2, range = 1-9). The mean sizes of the largest lymph node and the largest positive lymph node were 3.6 cm (median = 3.5, range = 0.4-6.5) and 0.9 cm (median = 0.5, range = 0.1-4.0), respectively. The mean size of the largest metastatic focus was 0.5 cm (median = 0.3, range = 0.1-2.2). The distribution of positive lymph node size is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912445921">Figure 1</xref>. Fifty-seven (68.6%) patients had the largest positive lymph node, measuring ≤1 cm in its greatest dimension. Positive lymph nodes ≤0.5 cm accounted for almost half of the events (41/83, 48%). The mean size of metastatic focus in the positive lymph nodes measuring ≤1 cm was 0.27 cm (median = 0.23, range = 0.1-1 cm).</p>

<title>Lymph Node Yield in Residual Pelvic Fat (Nonpalpable Lymph Nodes)</title>
<p>Among the 451 cases undergoing the modified protocol, a total of 4863 lymph nodes were submitted for histologic evaluation, and the mean number of lymph nodes per case was 10.8 (range = 2-29). In all, 3555 palpable lymph nodes were found by manual dissection, and an additional 1308 nonpalpable lymph nodes were found in the remainder of the adipose tissue. The mean additional number of lymph nodes found in the remainder of the adipose tissue was 2.9 (range = 0-13). Thus, submission of the residual fat after manual dissection increased lymph node yield by 36.7% (from 7.9 to 10.8).</p>
<p>Forty-two cases of pelvic lymph node metastases were identified in the cases that had entire adipose tissue submitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912445921">Figure 2</xref>). Nine (21.4%) of the 42 cases had a positive nonpalpable lymph node within separately submitted adipose tissue. The mean size of the positive nonpalpable lymph node was 0.15 cm, and it ranged from 0.1 to 0.25 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896912445921">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies have shown that the rate of lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer is closely related to the extent of PLND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912445921">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912445921">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912445921">13</xref></sup> However, the indication and extent of PLND in prostate cancer varies widely among urologists. Moreover, the optimal number of lymph nodes to assess the pathologic staging is not standardized. Barth et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912445921">19</xref></sup> suggested that at least 13 lymph nodes be investigated to achieve optimum staging. In the study by Briganti et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912445921">9</xref></sup> the probability of predicting lymph node metastasis was close to 0 when less than 10 lymph nodes were assessed. An autopsy study by Weingartner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912445921">20</xref></sup> showed that approximately 20 dissected lymph nodes can serve as a reliable guideline for a representative sampling. However, such high yields, as reported in the previous studies, are not generally achieved, and there is great variability among centers. In the survey of the 2009 International Society of Urological Pathology Consensus Conference,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912445921">14</xref></sup> 46% of respondents reported finding on average &lt;5 lymph nodes per radical prostatectomy specimen, 40% reported 5 to 10 lymph nodes, and 8% reported 11 to 15 lymph nodes, whereas only &lt;3% reported finding more than 15 lymph nodes.</p>
<p>Lymph node yield is highly affected by surgical technique and pathologic grossing technique. Two recent studies of RARP with PLND reported average retrieval of 18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896912445921">21</xref></sup> and 12.5 lymph nodes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912445921">22</xref></sup> respectively. The former study included the removal of external iliac, obturator, internal iliac lymph node groups, and common iliac lymph nodes up to the bifurcation of the aorta, whereas the latter study did not clearly define the extent of PLND. The lymph node yield (mean 10.8) in our study, retrieved by RARP with PLND, is high when taking into consideration that the level of common iliac lymph nodes was usually not included at our institution. Currently, none of the standard imaging techniques, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, is able to accurately identify lymph node metastasis as opposed to PLND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912445921">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912445921">24</xref></sup> The sensitivity of computed tomography and conventional magnetic resonance imaging to detect lymph node metastases is only 35%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912445921">23</xref></sup> The specificity of these techniques is about 82%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896912445921">25</xref></sup> This low sensitivity can in part be attributed to the fact that a lymph node size &gt;1 cm in diameter is required to identify lymph node metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912445921">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912445921">23</xref></sup> In pelvic lymph nodes, the lymphoid tissue is often extensively replaced by adipose tissue. The lymphoid tissue is often reduced to a rim, frequently ≤1 mm in thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912445921">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study showed that there is no positive correlation between the size of the lymph node and the probability of the metastasis. About half of our cases showed positive lymph nodes measuring &lt;0.5 cm in their greatest dimension, which are not easily detected by imaging studies. In a previous study by Cheng et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912445921">3</xref></sup> 20% of the cases showed the diameter of the largest metastatic lymph node to measure &lt;0.5 cm. This difference in finding increasing numbers of small positive metastatic lymph nodes may be attributable to change in the PLND template over the decades. The rate of detection of positive lymph nodes at our institution has significantly increased after the inclusion of the internal iliac lymph node group in the standard template.</p>
<p>The mean size of metastatic focus in the positive lymph nodes measuring ≤1 cm was 0.27 cm. Although some studies have found size of metastatic focus as a useful predictor of systemic progression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066896912445921">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066896912445921">27</xref></sup> others have found no difference in the risk of progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066896912445921">28</xref></sup> However, the focus of our study was not to analyze the risk of disease progression correlated to the features of lymph node metastasis but rather to describe the nature of metastases in prostate cancer. Nonetheless, it outlines an important point that both the size of metastatic foci and the size of positive lymph nodes are frequently small in prostate cancer. Additional studies are needed to clearly define the impact of these small positive lymph nodes on disease progression.</p>
<p>A notable feature of this study is that entire submission of the adipose tissue substantially increases the lymph node yield (36.7%). We feel that this is the best way to evaluate pelvic lymph nodes. Gross recognition of pelvic lymph node is sometimes more challenging because of replacement by adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912445921">5</xref></sup> Xylene and other clearing techniques have been used to increase lymph node retrieval.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912445921">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066896912445921">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066896912445921">30</xref></sup> Fat clearance technique has been shown to improve the retrieval of lymph nodes in colon cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066896912445921">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066896912445921">32</xref></sup> At the 2009 ISUP consensus conference,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912445921">14</xref></sup> 27% reported that they sampled all the tissues submitted by the surgeon for lymph node examination. However, only a few publications assessing the efficacy of submission of entire adipose tissue in prostate cancer are available, as opposed to colorectal cancer. A study of colon cancer by Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066896912445921">33</xref></sup> reported that submission of the entire mesenteric tissue may be useful to assess the correct pN stage in pN1 cases with fewer than 12 lymph nodes, identified manually, but it may not provide any additional information in pN0 cases with 12 or more lymph nodes found by manual dissection. Brown et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066896912445921">31</xref></sup> also concluded that conventional manual dissection of lymph nodes is sufficient for pN0 stage in colon cancer, but submission of entire fat is only useful for accurate staging in the pN1 group, where 3 of 4 cases were upstaged to pN2. In both studies, lymph node yield significantly increased, and most of the additionally found lymph nodes (80%) in the entirely submitted adipose tissue measured 2.0 mm or less. In a study of gynecologic malignancies conducted by Mhawech-Fauceglia et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066896912445921">34</xref></sup> the yield of lymph nodes increased remarkably with the submission of entire adipose tissue, reaching 14 lymph nodes in several cases. However, submission of additional lymph nodes did not affect tumor staging, as seen in other colon cancer studies. In our study, similarly, 9 of the 451 (1.99%) cases had lymph node metastases in the remainder of the adipose tissue. Three of the 451 (0.66%) cases had lymph node metastases exclusively in the separately submitted adipose tissue and were consequently upstaged from N0 to N1.</p>
<p>Thus, our study shows that submission of the entire adipose tissue for microscopic evaluation has a significant impact on lymph node yield. We also demonstrate that metastases from prostate cancer are frequently seen in small lymph nodes, and hence it is important to evaluate these additional small, nonpalpable lymph nodes by submission of entire adipose tissue for microscopic evaluation. Evaluation of these sections will require additional resources and added cost due to processing and evaluation of additional tissue blocks. But as opposed to mesenteric fat, the amount of submitted adipose tissue in pelvic lymph nodes is usually small. Therefore, submission of the remainder of the adipose tissue in prostate cancer is more feasible compared with submission of entire mesenteric fat in colon cancer evaluation in terms of time and cost-effectiveness. An alternative approach is to submit entire adipose tissue if the patient’s prostate needle biopsy shows prostate carcinoma with Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 and higher, which according to our study represents approximately 85% of cases of lymph node metastasis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, entire submission of pelvic adipose tissue not only increases the lymph node yield but can also provide more accurate nodal staging, especially in patients with high-risk factors for nodal metastasis.</p>

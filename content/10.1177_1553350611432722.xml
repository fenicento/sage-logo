<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to describe a new technique for laparoscopic removal of large ovarian cystic masses. The authors performed a retrospective study during the period January 2008 to December 2009 in the Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Aretaieion University Hospital; 19 women with large ovarian cysts were included in the study. During the study period, 53 women underwent laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts. Among them, 19 had very large complex ovarian cysts with a mean diameter of 8.4 cm. The mean age of the patients was 32.1 years. Ultrasound examination revealed findings suggestive of benign disease in all patients. In 8 out of 19 patients CA-125 levels were elevated, ranging from 40.5 to 194.7 IU/mL. A 5-mm suprapubic trocar was directly inserted into the cyst and fluid contents aspirated, so the decompressed cyst could fit in a 5-cm laparoscopic bag. The cyst wall was carefully detached from the healthy ovarian tissue and placed in the bag without any spillage. The remaining cyst wall was removed from the peritoneal cavity with the laparoscopic bag. The mean operative time was 45 minutes. No operative or postoperative complications were noted. There was no conversion to laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 1 day. Pathology revealed 7 endometriomas, 3 mucinous cystadenomas, 3 serous cystadenomas, 3 serous cysts, and 3 teratomas. Direct trocar insertion within the ovarian cyst followed by aspiration of the fluid contents is a safe and feasible method for the laparoscopic management of large ovarian cysts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The incidence of ovarian cysts in all women by the age of 65 years is 4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611432722">1</xref></sup> Laparoscopic management of benign ovarian cysts is currently the standard of care, and it has the advantage of decreased postoperative pain and duration of hospital stay as well as better cosmesis. The majority of adnexal masses can be safely removed laparoscopically; however, there are several limitations to laparoscopic management of large ovarian masses. These include tumor size (more than 5 cm in diameter), suspicion of malignancy, technical difficulties, and/or surgical skills. Whereas several authors have suggested that ovarian cysts &gt;8 cm in diameter are best managed by laparotomy, others have challenged this notion. In a survey among doctors, an equal preference for open versus laparoscopic surgery was noted for the management of endometriomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611432722">2</xref></sup> However, in a recent retrospective study that included premenopausal women with dermoid cysts, a total spillage rate of 12% was seen after laparoscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611432722">3</xref></sup> Inadvertent intraoperative rupture was found to be significantly associated with cystectomies of large ovarian cysts, and for this reason, laparotomy or laparoscopic-assisted extracorporeal cystectomy have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611432722">4</xref></sup> On the other hand, Eltabbakh et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611432722">5</xref></sup> in a prospective study of laparoscopic surgery among women with benign ovarian cysts larger than 10 cm showed that laparoscopy is feasible and safe. In the same study, the cysts were extracted after aspiration through the vagina, the lower quadrant, or an umbilical incision. In a randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopy to laparoscopically guided minilaparotomy for large ovarian cysts, the relative risk for intraperitoneal spillage among women treated with laparoscopy was 5.55 (95% confidence interval = 1.88-16.33), and the operative time and reported surgical difficulty were significantly higher in patients treated with laparoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611432722">6</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the postoperative hospital stay was shorter for the laparoscopic group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611432722">6</xref></sup> In another retrospective study, the size of an ovarian cyst was not found to be a contraindication for laparoscopic surgery after proper patient selection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611432722">7</xref></sup> In this study, among 21 laparoscopic surgeries for ovarian masses, there were only 2 conversions to laparotomy either because of malignancy or because of technical difficulties. In all cases, however, the procedure was completed through a small laparotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611432722">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several laparoscopic techniques have been proposed in the literature for the management of large ovarian cystic masses. These include aspiration through paraumbilical minilaparotomy (for cysts above the umbilicus) or aspiration within an endobag, purse-string suture to secure the cystic wall around the aspiration needle (for cysts below the umbilicus), intra-abdominal puncture with a 5-mm trocar and closure of the puncture site with an endoloop, laparoscopic-guided aspiration and extracorporeal cystectomy, and laparoscopic-guided aspiration with a Bonanno suprapubic catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611432722">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611432722"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611432722">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study is to present the experience of our institution in the laparoscopic management of large ovarian cysts and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of such an approach.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a retrospective study involving patients with ovarian pathology who were managed laparoscopically in our institution from January 2008 to December 2009. In all, 19 women with large ovarian cysts (&gt;7 cm) were identified and included in the study. Prior to the procedure, all patients had sonographic evaluation of the pelvic anatomy and measurements of tumor markers related to the ovary. The surgical technique and clinicopathological findings are reported. All procedures were performed by the first author (NFV) assisted by one of the coauthors each time. The ethics committee of Aretaieion University Hospital gave approval for the study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1553350611432722">
<title>Description of the Technique</title>
<p>The Open Hasson technique through the umbilicus was used for entry into the abdominal cavity. The pelvis/peritoneal cavity was thoroughly inspected and the ovarian pathology was identified. Macroscopic characteristics of the ovarian pathology suggestive of benign lesion included a smooth ovarian surface, absence of significant ascites, nonadherence of the mass to the surrounding organs (unless there was strong suggestion of endometriosis), normal-looking omentum, and no signs of additional lesions within the abdominal cavity. Following the inspection of the peritoneal cavity, a second 5-mm trocar was introduced in the right- or the left-lower quadrant under direct visualization. In cases of a very large mass occupying the lower abdomen, the accessory trocar was placed in the right- or left-upper quadrants. Peritoneal washings were obtained via the accessory trocar and sent for cytological evaluation. The ovarian mass was stabilized with the help of a smooth grasper introduced through the second port, and under direct visualization, another 5-mm trocar was inserted suprapubically directly into the cystic mass, making sure that the sheath of the trocar was well within the cyst. It should be mentioned that the entry location on the cyst was not standardized in relation to blood supply but based on the closest location to the abdominal wall. The stylet was removed, and the suction-irrigation probe was inserted directly into the cystic mass. The fluid contents of the mass were aspirated and sent for cytological examination. When the decompression of the mass allowed adequate space, 2 additional 11-mm contralateral trocars were introduced into the peritoneal cavity. A 5-cm endobag was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and positioned directly underneath the ovarian pathology. As expected initially, the endobag could not accommodate the abnormal ovary; however, when the cyst was partially decompressed, we were able to fit it in. In those women desiring to preserve their ovary, the cyst wall was meticulously detached from the surrounding healthy ovarian tissue, and the cyst was placed into the endobag. In cases where there was no identifiable healthy ovarian tissue, oophorectomy (with or without salpingectomy) was performed in the usual fashion. The excised mass was removed within an endoscopic bag. Finally, the peritoneal cavity was thoroughly rinsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611432722">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611432722"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611432722">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 53 women underwent laparoscopic management of ovarian pathology. Among those women, 19 were identified as having large ovarian cysts (&gt;7 cm). Demographic characteristics of these patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611432722">Table 1</xref>. The other 34 women also underwent laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts; however, they were excluded from our study merely based on the smaller size of their cysts, which led the surgical team to use a different approach (cystectomy). None of those cases converted to laparotomy or were malignant, and they included serous cysts, endometriomas, teratomas, and serous cystadenomas. Out of 19 patients, 16 desired preservation of their ovary if possible, whereas 3 did not object to possible oophorectomy. The mean operative time was 45 minutes (range 35-60 minutes). No spillage was noted. The estimated blood loss was minimal. There was no conversion to laparotomy. Out of 19 patients, 17 eventually underwent ovarian cystectomy and 2 underwent ipsilateral oophorectomy. No operative or postoperative complications were described. The mean hospital stay was 24 hours (range 20-32 hours). Most patients were hospitalized for 1 day or even discharged on the day of surgery; however, some of them remained overnight but this was a result of medical problems unrelated to the surgical procedure. Pathology revealed 7 endometriomas, 3 mucinous cystadenomas, 3 serous cystadenomas, 3 serous cysts, and 3 teratomas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350611432722">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts in women of reproductive age is currently the standard of care. Laparoscopic management of very large ovarian masses, however, is still under debate. Traditionally, these patients have been managed with conventional laparotomy either by a midline or a Pfannenstiel incision depending on the perceived risk for malignancy and for intraoperative rupture. It could be argued, however, that laparoscopic management of these cysts could be safely performed following a thorough preoperative assessment of their size and nature in order to achieve complete removal of the ovarian pathology and avoid spillage. For this reason, preoperative Doppler ultrasound, CT, and tumor markers are routinely used in our institution during the preoperative evaluation of patients. Ovarian cysts were considered suspicious in the presence of at least 1 of the following features: thick/irregular cyst wall, thick septa, and solid papillary projections as described by Marret.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611432722">11</xref></sup> According to the literature, the risk of malignancy of ovarian cysts after careful preoperative assessment could be reduced to 0.2% to 0.6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611432722">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611432722">12</xref></sup> The size of the benign ovarian cyst continues to be a limiting factor for laparoscopic approach.</p>
<p>Following inspection of the peritoneal cavity, insertion of the suprapubic trocar directly within the cyst and aspiration of the fluid contents is proposed because otherwise the space constraint makes the procedure difficult and increases the risk of rupture. Mahajan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611432722">12</xref></sup> in a letter to the editor proposed the use of direct trocar insertion through Palmer’s point because adhesions are rare in this site. Furthermore, they have also suggested aspiration of the fluid contents through the same cannula in a similar fashion to the one presented here.</p>
<p>Cyst rupture and spillage of its contents—according to Gal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611432722">13</xref></sup>—represent common events during surgical management of ovarian cystic masses. Yuen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611432722">14</xref></sup> showed that spillage rates are comparable in laparoscopy and laparotomy. The incidence of tumor spillage in published series of laparoscopically managed large ovarian masses varies between 22% and 100%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611432722">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611432722">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611432722">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611432722">16</xref></sup> whereas the risk of rupture during laparotomy has been reported to be in the range of 10% to 26%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611432722">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several techniques have been described that aim to prevent or eliminate spillage during laparoscopy. Göçmen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611432722">18</xref></sup> proposed the use of grasping forceps through the 5-mm port site to obliterate the puncture site and minimize spillage. Another measure used to minimize intraoperative spillage of the cystic contents is the removal of the specimen through a laparoscopic bag.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611432722">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611432722">19</xref></sup> In addition, aggressive peritoneal lavage is proposed at the end of the procedure, especially if spillage has occurred.</p>
<p>In our series, spillage of the cyst contents did not occur in any case. In addition, all the procedures were completed laparoscopically, and there was no conversion to laparotomy. In a randomized prospective study evaluating surgical management of patients with ovarian cysts less than 10 cm in diameter, there was a significant reduction in the operative morbidity, postoperative pain, hospital stay, and recovery period in the laparoscopy as compared with the laparotomy group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611432722">6</xref></sup> In our study, we have demonstrated that laparoscopic management is feasible even for large ovarian cysts and may offer the additional benefits of laparoscopic surgery (decreased hospitalization, reduced postoperative pain, faster return to normal activities, and better cosmetic results).</p>
<p>One of the major concerns during surgical management of ovarian cystic masses is the adverse impact of cyst rupture and spillage in cases of malignancy. Although the classical surgical dogma of avoiding intraoperative rupture of any tumor is undisputable, the impact of intraoperative cyst rupture in early-stage ovarian cancer is controversial. So far, no significant difference in survival or disease-free interval has been described between patients with iatrogenic stage Ic epithelial ovarian cancer and stage IA and IB disease. According to Dembo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611432722">19</xref></sup> tumor grade and presence of dense adhesions or ascites are the sole prognostic factors for tumor relapse. Sjövall et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611432722">20</xref></sup> in a study involving 394 patients showed that the survival rate reached 78% in patients with intact tumor, 87% in those with punctured cysts, and 84% in those with spontaneous rupture. In contrast, Vergote et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611432722">21</xref></sup> in a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in stage-I ovarian carcinoma identified the degree of differentiation as the most powerful prognostic factor for disease-free survival, followed by rupture before surgery, rupture during surgery, FIGO stage, and age. Histological type, dense adhesions, extracapsular growth, ascites, and size of the tumor had no prognostic value for disease-free survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611432722">21</xref></sup> According to Coukos and Rudin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350611432722">22</xref></sup> patients with well-differentiated (other than clear cell) ovarian cancer at stage IA or IB in contrast to IC do not require chemotherapy. If this is indeed the case, then one could argue that iatrogenic (rupture and spillage during surgery) IC stage could affect the quality of life for these patients because they may require chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Another theoretical complication is the development of pseudomyxoma peritonei, resulting from iatrogenic spillage of a mucinous cystadenoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350611432722">23</xref></sup> Benign mucinous cystadenomas account for 15% of all ovarian neoplasms, and they usually present as large ovarian cysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350611432722">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350611432722">25</xref></sup> In our study, 3 out of 19 patients had benign mucinous cystadenomas. Regarding laparoscopic management of dermoid cysts, it is known that rupture of a dermoid cyst could result in chemical abacterial peritonitis. Furthermore, there is a small possibility of malignant teratoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350611432722">26</xref></sup> In our study, 3 out of 19 cysts were benign teratomas, which were managed laparoscopically without complications. Another potential risk is the accuracy of frozen section diagnosis. It is known that specificity and sensitivity are high in ovarian tumors regardless of size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350611432722">27</xref></sup> Nevertheless, this is also the case for ovarian masses managed by laparotomy. In our institution, we elect not to perform definite surgery in women of reproductive age based on frozen section results prior to the final histopathological report.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Direct trocar insertion within the ovarian cyst followed by aspiration permits the successful laparoscopic removal of large (diameter &gt;7 cm) ovarian cystic masses with minimal risk of spillage and conversion to laparotomy. Proper preoperative selection of patients is of major importance. The technique when performed by a trained surgeon is safe, effective, and associated with less morbidity compared with open techniques.</p>

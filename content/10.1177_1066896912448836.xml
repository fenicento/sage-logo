<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical/prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating mast cells (TIMs) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). TIM infiltration in 325 stage I to III CRC specimens was detected by immunohistochemistry. The optimal cutpoint of TIM density was assessed by the X-tile program. TIM infiltration in CRC was significantly higher than in normal colorectal tissues. According to the X-tile program, the cutpoint for high TIM infiltration in CRC was determined when TIM density was more than 8.0 per high-power field. Correlation analysis between TIM density and clinicopathological variables demonstrated that TIM infiltration was significantly associated with gender, nodal status, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high TIM infiltration was a risk factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival. Taken together, high TIM infiltration can be an independent and useful biomarker for predicting the poor survival of patients with CRC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies, representing the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women globally, with more than 1.2 million new cancer cases and 608 700 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912448836">1</xref></sup> In China, CRC ranks as the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth most frequent cause of cancer-related death; 153 760 new cases of CRC were diagnosed, and 78 700 people died from the disease in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912448836">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the universal features of CRC is the dense desmoplastic stromal reaction comprising epithelial cancer cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Cancer growth is dependent on the reciprocal interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912448836">3</xref></sup> The tumor immune microenvironment, which is considered a hallmark of the cancer, is a major factor affecting the development of CRC as evidenced by the fact that patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a much higher risk of CRC compared with their healthy counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912448836">4</xref></sup> Tumor-infiltrating mast cells (TIMs), a critical component of the tumor immune microenvironment, have been extensively studied for their orchestration of allergic reactions and autoimmunity and are increasingly recognized as an important prognostic factor in a number of human malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912448836">5</xref></sup> The prognostic value of TIM seems to be dependent on cancer type, increased mast cell infiltration has been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912448836">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912448836">7</xref></sup> prostate cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912448836">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912448836">9</xref></sup> thyroid cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912448836">10</xref></sup> and liver cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912448836">11</xref></sup> but with a favorable prognosis in pleural mesothelioma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912448836">12</xref></sup> lung cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912448836">13</xref></sup> and breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912448836">14</xref></sup> However, data about its benefit or detriment to tumorigenesis of CRC remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912448836">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912448836">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912448836"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912448836">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, a large cohort of stage I to III CRC patients with a long-term follow-up was enrolled. TIM density was detected by immunohistochemical analysis (IHC), and the X-tile program was applied to determine the optimal cutpoint. Then, the clinical/prognostic significance of TIM in CRC was analyzed.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1066896912448836">
<title>Patients and Follow-up</title>
<p>This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China). CRC patients undergoing initial resection for stage I to III disease at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China) from 2000 to 2005 were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the patient underwent curative resection, (2) the patient had a regular follow-up, and (3) there were adequate specimens. Exclusion criteria were (1) history of previous malignant disease or a second primary tumor, (2) familial adenomatous polyposis patients, (3) preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation. All eligible CRC patients were identified from an IRB-approved CRC database, which was maintained by specialists. Data pertaining to the following clinicopathological variables were collected in this study: age at the time of surgery, gender, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, family history of CRC, preoperative bowel obstruction, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, tumor location, tumor diameter, histology, differentiation, depth of invasion, nodal status, distant metastasis, and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage. Tumor stage was redefined according to the AJCC TNM staging system for colon and rectal cancer (7th edition).</p>
<p>Patients’ follow-up was carried out according to the original plan. Basically, patients were evaluated at the hospital or contacted by telephone or letters, every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, and annually thereafter. The primary end point of this study was overall survival (OS) defined as the time from surgery to death from any cause. The secondary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from surgery to the first event of either recurrent disease or death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066896912448836">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde and were embedded in paraffin. Routine hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on the sections for histopathological evaluation. Tissues, which were cut into 5-µm sections on silanized glass slides, were deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded alcohols before being exposed to the antigen retrieval system (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0 for 25 minutes). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes at room temperature. Following incubation with the primary mouse monoclonal tryptase antibody (1:4000, NeoMarkers, CA) overnight at 4°C, the sections were stained with diaminobenzidine or amino-ethylcarbazide in an Envision System (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The slides were finally counterstained with hematoxylin (Zymed Laboratories Inc, San Francisco, CA). A negative control was obtained by replacing the primary antibody with a normal murine IgG. Known immunostaining-positive slides were used as positive controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066896912448836">
<title>Evaluation of the IHC Variable</title>
<p>To evaluate TIM density, the stained sections were screened under low power (×100-fold magnification) to identify representative fields. TIM was then counted under high power (HP; ×400-fold magnification) in 5 fields of vision with an ocular micrometer using the Leica DMI 4000B inverted research microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The results were expressed as the mean (±standard deviation) number of mast cells in the 5 HP fields. The mast cell count in each section was scored independently by 2 investigators with no prior knowledge of clinicopathological parameters. The interobserver agreement for the TIM count was 85%. Disagreements were reevaluated until a consensus was reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066896912448836">
<title>Selection of Cutpoint Value</title>
<p>The X-tile program (version 3.6.1, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) was used for optimization of cutpoint of TIM density based on outcomes for CRC patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912448836">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912448836">19</xref></sup> The X-tile program divided the cohorts randomly into a matched training and validation set as a method for selecting the optimal cutpoint. Statistical significance was assessed by using the cutoff value derived from a training set to parse a separate validation set, using a standard log-rank method, with <italic>P</italic> values obtained from a lookup table. The X-tile plots allowed determination of an optimal cutpoint value while correcting for the use of minimum <italic>P</italic> statistics by Miller-Siegmund <italic>P</italic> value correction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912448836">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066896912448836">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Comparison of the mast cell distribution between CRC and normal colorectal tissues was evaluated by a paired <italic>t</italic> test. Monte Carlo simulations were used to adjust for multiple observations in optimal cutpoint value selection. The correlation analysis between TIM density and clinicopathological variables was analyzed using a χ<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>t</italic> test, or Fisher’s exact test (2 tailed). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to assess the prognostic independence of variables for survival. All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS software version 16 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>In all, 325 CRC patients were enrolled for IHC analysis in this study; 177 (54.5%) patients were male, and 148 (45.5%) were female, with a mean age of 58.8 ± 14.1 years. Based on the AJCC classification, there were 54 (16.6%) stage I patients, 147 (45.2%) stage II patients, and 124 (38.2%) stage III patients. The location of cancer was the colon in 156 (48.0%) patients, rectum in 168 (51.7%), and unspecified in 1 (0.3%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896912448836">Table 1</xref>). The mean tumor diameter was 4.9 ± 2.0 cm. Of these patients, 70 (21.5%) died, and 20 (6.2%) other patients developed recurrence and/or metastasis after a mean follow-up of 63.6 ± 28.0 months.</p>

<title>IHC Analysis of TIM and Selection of Optimal Cutpoint Value</title>
<p>We first sought to confirm that mast cells infiltrate human CRC. A subset of tumor specimens from 20 CRC patients as well as paired adjacent normal colorectal tissues were immunohistochemically stained with mast-cell–specific tryptase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912448836">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912448836">1B</xref>). Mast cells were identified in the stroma of all cancers. There was a statistically significant increase of mast cell infiltration in the stroma of CRC compared with adjacent normal colorectal tissues (8.4 ± 5.6 vs 4.8 ± 3.3, <italic>P</italic> = .034; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912448836">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>The mean TIM density for all the 325 CRC patients was 8.3 ± 6.7/HP field. To avoid the problems of multiple cutpoint selection, we used the X-tile program to determine cutoff value for TIM density. Based on patients’ OS, the whole cohort was divided into high-density and low-density populations at a cutpoint of 8.0/HP field (<italic>P</italic> = .005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912448836">Figure 2</xref>). This optimal cutpoint assessed using patients’ OS was applied to DFS, which identified the cutoff value that reached high statistical significance again (<italic>P</italic> = .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912448836">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Association Between TIM, Clinicopathological Variables, and Patients’ Survival</title>
<p>According to the X-tile program, high TIM density was examined in 116 (35.7%) CRC patients and low TIM density in 209 (64.3%). Correlation analysis between TIM and various clinicopathological variables demonstrated that TIM was significantly associated with the patient’s gender (<italic>P</italic> = .040), nodal status (<italic>P</italic> = .020), and AJCC stage (<italic>P</italic> = .003).

<p>Both Kaplan-Meier analysis and the univariate Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to investigate the impact of TIM infiltration on CRC patients’ survival, which revealed that high TIM density was significantly correlated with worse OS (log-rank test, <italic>P</italic> = .005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912448836">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1066896912448836">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CRC is a common malignancy throughout the world. Although considerable improvements in diagnosis and treatment of CRC have been made over the past few decades, CRC remains a major public health problem. Clinically, the treatment of and prognosis for CRC patients predominantly relies on the AJCC stage determined by clinical and pathological findings. But it is well known that the current staging system is still not very reliable. Using SEER data from 1991 through 2000, a study found that stage IIIa CRC disease was associated with a statistically significantly improved survival compared with that of stage IIb disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896912448836">21</xref></sup> Although many limitations have been resolved as a result of the seventh edition of the AJCC Staging Manual, several issues are still controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912448836">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912448836"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912448836">24</xref></sup> Recent studies indicate that immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are crucial factors affecting tumor progression, with some found to be even superior to the AJCC stage in predicting outcomes for patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896912448836">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066896912448836"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066896912448836"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066896912448836">28</xref></sup> TIM, as an active participant in the tumor immune system, has been studied in several cancers, including CRC. However, its role in the prognosis for CRC remains controversial.</p>
<p>In the present study, we first used a subset of 20 paired primary CRC and normal adjacent colorectal tissue to examine the distribution dynamics of mast cells. In line with findings from other cancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912448836">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912448836">10</xref></sup> our results confirmed that mast cell infiltration in the stroma of CRCs was significantly greater than that in normal tissues. After calculating the TIM density for 325 CRC patients, the X-tile program was applied for assessments of scores to divide the patients into 2 populations based on TIM density (high-density and low-density groups) to avoid predetermined arbitrary cutpoints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912448836">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912448836">20</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that correlation analysis revealed that there was a strong trend toward increased TIM infiltration in male CRC patients compared with female patients. A possible explanation is that mast cells express estrogen receptors and when combined with estrogen would result in inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α release, which is a major mast-cell–derived autocrine growth factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066896912448836">29</xref></sup> Although the exact underlying reason for this finding is unclear, similar results have been reported in follicular lymphoma and pancreatic cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912448836">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066896912448836">30</xref></sup> As expected, TIM was also found to be closely associated with nodal status as well as AJCC stage. In this perspective, TIM infiltration increased as the tumor progressed, suggesting that it might play a paramount role in the process of CRC progression and metastasis, thus had the potential to predict poor outcomes for CRC patients. Indeed, this was verified by the multivariate analysis, which showed that TIM infiltration was a prognostic factor independent of certain well-established clinicopathological parameters for both OS and DFS. Furthermore, subgroup analysis also suggested a crucial role of TIM in the prognosis for CRC patients in stage II and stage III but not stage I, which might be a result of the small population size (n = 54). Another interesting finding of this study is that consistent with a recently published large population-sized study, our results showed that the preoperative serum CEA level was also an independent prognostic factor for both OS and DFS, thus supporting the suggestion of incorporating the CEA level into the conventional TNM staging system for CRC as originally proposed by AJCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912448836">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the underlying mechanisms of the predictive value of TIM for CRC patients were not further explored in the present study, there were several lines of evidence supporting our findings. For many years, mast cells have been known to accumulate around blood vessels and produce proangiogenic molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and histamine, thus leading to suggestions that they may act as the “angiogenic switch” during tumor growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912448836">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066896912448836">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066896912448836"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066896912448836">33</xref></sup> This hypothesis was confirmed by studies that found a significant correlation between TIM density and the number of microvessel counts in human cancer tissues. In addition to the proangiogenic effects, mast cells are major sources of proteases, which act on the surrounding ECM, and have been demonstrated to play a role in tissue remodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066896912448836">34</xref></sup> But in the context of developing tumors, the ability of mast cells to remodel tissues is subverted, disrupting the surrounding ECM and increasing tumor spread.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912448836">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066896912448836">35</xref></sup> Allograft tolerance studies indicated that mast cells were essential in CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T-cell-dependent peripheral tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066896912448836">36</xref></sup> Moreover, studies using animal models showed that polyps were infiltrated by mast cells and their precursors, and depletion of mast cells would lead to a profound remission of existing polyps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066896912448836">37</xref></sup> To summarize, though it is still under debate, it seems that most of the literature to date lends weight to the idea that mast cells have protumoral properties.</p>
<p>Several studies have been done to investigate the prognostic value of TIM in CRC patients. An early study by Fisher et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1066896912448836">38</xref></sup> indicated that mast cells might play a role in the natural history of CRC, and TIM was a significant factor predicting poor outcomes even after being adjusted for treatment, Dukes’ stage, and nodal status. But the results were not confirmed in studies by Acikalin et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1066896912448836">39</xref></sup> Gulubova and Vlaykova,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1066896912448836">40</xref></sup> Xia et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1066896912448836">41</xref></sup> and Yodavudh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1066896912448836">42</xref></sup> On the contrary, Nielsen and colleagues believed that TIM was an independent factor associated with a favorable prognosis in CRC patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1066896912448836">43</xref></sup> After a meticulous review of the studies that failed to find a significant correlation between TIM infiltration and prognosis, we surprisingly found that the TIM infiltration was indeed significantly associated with poor survival of CRC patients in the univariate analysis in 3 of the 4 studies. But the significance was lost in the multivariate analysis, a phenomenon that could be caused by a small enrolled population size (n &lt; 150).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1066896912448836">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1066896912448836">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1066896912448836">42</xref></sup> And unlike in our study where the X-tile program was applied to assess the optimal cutpoint, mean or median values of mast cell counts were used as the cutpoint in these studies, which could also have led to masking of the real prognostic value of TIM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912448836">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the results obtained from this large cohort of CRC patients establish that TIM infiltration is a strong and independent predictor of poor survival. Examination of TIM by IHC analysis can be used as an additional effective way to identify patients at high risk of tumor progression, thus optimizing individual treatment of CRC patients.</p>

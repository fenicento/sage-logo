<p>Recent studies have shown an association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. We previously reported that intravenous challenge with <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (<italic>Aa</italic>) accelerated atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient spontaneously hyperlipidemic (Apoe<sup>shl</sup>) mice. In this study, we investigated whether live cells were required for atherosclerosis induction or whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone was sufficient to increase atherosclerotic damage. Mice were injected intravenously with live <italic>Aa</italic> HK1651, heat-killed (H.K.) <italic>Aa</italic>, or <italic>Aa</italic> LPS 3 times a week for 3 weeks and were sacrificed at 15 weeks of age. The areas of the aortic sinus that were covered with atherosclerotic plaques were significantly larger in mice treated with live <italic>Aa</italic>, H.K. <italic>Aa</italic>, or <italic>Aa</italic> LPS compared with vehicle-challenged mice. The order of the extent of atherosclerosis was live <italic>Aa</italic> &gt; H.K. <italic>Aa</italic> &gt; <italic>Aa</italic> LPS &gt; sham. Toll and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor mRNA expression significantly increased in the live <italic>Aa</italic>, H.K. <italic>Aa</italic>, and <italic>Aa</italic> LPS treatment groups. <italic>Aa</italic> challenge markedly promoted the oxidation of LDL through oxidative stress involving NADPH oxidase- and myeloperoxidase-derived reactive oxygen species. These results suggested that <italic>Aa</italic> promoted innate immune signaling and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and may facilitate atheroma development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A recent report has indicated that there was no significant relationship between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513475625">Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). We previously showed that <italic>Aa</italic> and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient spontaneously hyperlipidemic (KOR- Apoe<sup>shl</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513475625">Koizumi <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513475625">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, previous observations suggested that inflammation caused by periodontopathic bacteria may play a synergistic role with other pre-existing factors, such as hyperlipidemia, resulting in the development of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513475625">Fukasawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). These observations support the hypothesis that a periodontal pathogen is not an independent risk factor, but acts in concert with hyperlipidemia to exacerbate atherosclerosis lesion formation. However, whether live <italic>Aa</italic> was necessary for this process or whether its component alone is sufficient to cause an increase in atherosclerotic damage remains unclear. Periodontal bacteria such as <italic>Aa</italic> and their components may have direct access to the circulation through bleeding periodontal pockets. <italic>Aa</italic> has been detected in human atherosclerotic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513475625">Kozarov <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513475625">Nakano <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513475625">Figuero <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, patients with periodontitis are known to suffer from endotoxemia, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513475625">Pussinen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). <italic>Aa</italic>-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) complexed with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may enter the vessel wall, activating inflammatory cells to produce MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513475625">Tuomainen <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). LPS isolated from <italic>Aa</italic> is known to transform macrophages into lipid-laden foam cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513475625">Lakio <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The pro-inflammatory response induced by <italic>Aa</italic> leukotoxin is also associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513475625">Hansson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513475625">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which lipoproteins accumulate, eliciting an inflammatory response in the arterial wall. An important consequence of this process is the cellular oxidation of LDL, which converts the lipoprotein to a highly atherogenic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513475625">Stocker and Keaney, 2004</xref>). Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) <italic>via</italic> NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) is responsible for LDL oxidation and impairment of cellular function. Moreover, recent studies have shown that innate immune signaling in aortic tissue may be associated with atherogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513475625">Lundberg and Hansson, 2010</xref>). The present study was performed to examine whether systemic circulatory challenge with live <italic>Aa</italic>, heat-killed <italic>Aa</italic>, or <italic>Aa</italic> LPS promotes and accelerates the development of atherosclerotic lesions in BALB/c <italic>apo</italic>E-deficient spontaneously hyperlipidemic (C. KOR- Apoe<sup>shl</sup> ) mice as an alternative model of <italic>apo</italic>E deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513475625">Koizumi <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, we assessed the involvement of innate immune signaling molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), ox-LDL, other oxidative stress biomarkers, and ROS-generating oxidase in <italic>Aa</italic>-accelerated atherosclerosis.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022034513475625">
<title>Bacterial Strains and LPS</title>
<p><italic>Aa</italic> HK1651 (ATCC 700685) was cultured anaerobically as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513475625">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Bacteria were harvested from Todd-Hewitt broth (BBL, Cockeysville, MD, USA) supplemented with 1% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) and re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for intravenous (i.v.) infection. H.K. <italic>Aa</italic> was prepared by being heated at 100°C for 30 min. <italic>Aa</italic> LPS was prepared from <italic>Aa</italic> HK1651 by the hot phenol-water method, and was purified by enzymatic hydrolysis with nuclease and protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513475625">Koga <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0022034513475625">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>Ten-week-old female (C. KOR-Apoe<sup>shl</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513475625">Matsushima <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) obtained from Japan SLC Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan) were provided a regular chow diet and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nihon University approved all the animal protocols. After 1 wk, the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (<italic>n</italic> = 6 <italic>per</italic> group). The mice were injected i.v. with 0.1 mL of live <italic>Aa</italic> (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse), H.K. <italic>Aa</italic> (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse), <italic>Aa</italic> LPS (50 µg/mouse), or PBS 3 times a wk for 3 wks as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513475625">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Mice were sacrificed 1 wk after the last injection. Blood samples were collected in heparinized syringes from the orbital veins of mice anesthetized with Isozol (Nichi Iko, Toyama, Japan).</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034513475625">
<title>Quantification of Atherosclerotic Lesion Area</title>
<p>Frozen sections of the proximal aorta were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513475625">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Briefly, we stained 6-µm-thick sections <italic>per</italic> mouse with Oil Red O to visualize neutral lipid and counterstained them with hematoxylin. Total lesion area <italic>per</italic> slide and percentage of the aortic lumen occupied by lesions <italic>per</italic> section were calculated with image analysis software (Lumina Vision, Mitani Co., Fukui, Japan). The values of 15 sections <italic>per</italic> animal were averaged and expressed as the mean lesion area and percentage of the lumen of the proximal aorta occupied by lesions <italic>per</italic> section <italic>per</italic> animal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034513475625">
<title>Analysis of Gene Expression by Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA purified from the aorta (<italic>n</italic> = 6 <italic>per</italic> group) was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primers using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to generate cDNA. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses were performed in a Thermal Cycler Dice real-time PCR system (Takara, Shiga, Japan) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513475625">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The primers are shown in the Appendix Fig. PCR consisted of an initial denaturation step (95°C for 10 min), followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 25 sec, and 60°C for 35 sec. Each gene was tested in triplicate. For receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), PCR reactions were performed with the following cycle conditions: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min. Target RNA levels were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022034513475625">
<title>Serum Analysis</title>
<p>Sera were obtained prior to the animals’ death as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513475625">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The level of ox-LDL was determined with a Mouse Oxidized Low-density Lipoprotein ELISA Kit (CUSABIO Biotech Co., Ltd., Newark, DE, USA). Serum 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) and MPO levels, respectively, were determined with a Highly Sensitive 8-OHdG Check ELISA Kit and an MPO ELISA Kit (Nikken Seil Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan).</p>

<sec id="section8-0022034513475625">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Mouse aortas were fixed with 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513475625">Ishigaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Paraffin-embedded sections of aortic sinus (4 µm thick) were then incubated with anti-mouse-4- hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) monoclonal antibody (Ab) (Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan), HOCl-Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein (ox-LDL) polyclonal Ab (Nikken Seil Co., Ltd.), and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) polyclonal Ab (ab58375; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), followed by N-Histofine Simple Stain MAX PO (G) (Nichirei Bioscience) and diaminobenzidine substrate (DAKO Japan, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022034513475625">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). Differences in total atherosclerotic plaque accumulation were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Intravenous injection may not be a physiologically relevant model for the study of <italic>Aa</italic>, since this pathogen can be colonized in the oral cavities of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513475625">Garlet <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). However, neither heat-killed bacteria nor LPS can be established in the mouth by single administration. Therefore, we carried out our experiments by the i.v. route.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that i.v. challenge of atherosclerosis-prone hyperlipidemic Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice with live <italic>Aa</italic>, H.K. <italic>Aa</italic>, or <italic>Aa</italic> LPS accelerated atherosclerosis and increased the plaque lipid content. However, the order of extent of atherosclerosis was live <italic>Aa</italic> &gt; H.K. <italic>Aa</italic> &gt; <italic>Aa</italic> LPS &gt; PBS. The extent of atherosclerotic lesions in <italic>Aa</italic>-challenged mice was significantly greater than that in <italic>Aa</italic> LPS-challenged mice. Furthermore, live <italic>Aa</italic>-challenged mice showed significantly increased aortic expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, and NOD1 compared with PBS-injected controls; the H.K. <italic>Aa</italic> and <italic>Aa</italic> LPS treatment groups exhibited significant increases in TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2 expression.</p>
<p>In a complex tissue such as the atherosclerotic lesion, innate signals can originate from several sources and promote atherogenesis through association with pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). These signals include various extracellular activation cascades and intracellular signaling pathways and lead to effective clearance of infectious agents and induction of inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513475625">Lundberg and Hansson, 2010</xref>). TLR4, for example, is the receptor for Gram-negative LPS, as well as other bacterial toxins. TLR2 interacts with the largest variety of pathogenic structures, including bacterial lipoproteins, peptidoglycan, and lipoteichoic acid. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA. Therefore, live <italic>Aa</italic> could induce the expression of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, due to their surface expression of several pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In contrast, LPS significantly increased TLR4, but not TLR2 and TLR9, expression. Furthermore, previous studies have implicated NLR inflammasomes in the responses to a wide range of microbial pathogens, inflammatory diseases, cancer, and metabolic and autoimmune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513475625">Davis <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). The immediate responses of NODs to LPS could also result from NF-κB activation <italic>via</italic> TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513475625">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Since it activates multiple PRRs, live <italic>Aa</italic> may induce a more significant inflammatory response than H.K. <italic>Aa</italic> and <italic>Aa</italic> LPS.</p>
<p>Lipid peroxidation (LPO) plays an important role in many diseases. In particular, oxidation of LDL may be a key step in the development of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513475625">Stocker and Keaney, 2004</xref>). Ox-LDL is incorporated into macrophages <italic>via</italic> receptor-mediated endocytosis, leading to the transformation of macrophages into foam cells and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. 4HNE is a lipid peroxidation product of polyunsaturated fatty acids formed during the oxidation of LDL or membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513475625">Uchida, 2003</xref>). Oxidized phosphatidylcholine (oxPC), the most abundant oxidized phospholipid in ox-LDL, is a specific substrate for PLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513475625">Stremler <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>). NADPH oxidase and MPO are the most important superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>)-producing enzymes in hypertension and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513475625">Cai <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513475625">Nicholls and Hazen, 2005</xref>). RAGE and Cav-1 have been implicated in the activation of oxidant stress and inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513475625">Reddy <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034513475625">Yun <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the increase in ox-LDL level and accompanying increase in NADPH expression or oxidative stress in the aorta of <italic>Aa</italic>-challenged mice suggested that <italic>Aa</italic> plays a central role in oxidative stress and oxidization of LDL. Indeed, periodontitis patients have increased levels of LPO in plasma, saliva, and gingival crevicular fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513475625">Akalin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), and these levels have been correlated with the severity of periodontal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513475625">Akalin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513475625">Bastos <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Since atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, implications from the results of a three-week experiment in mice may be difficult to determine. However, the Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice were hyperlipidemic and Apo-E-deficient; therefore, the inflammatory markers had already increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513475625">Tabibiazar <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), and the symptoms of arteriosclerosis were shown by the progress of time regardless of infection. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of <italic>Aa</italic> or <italic>Aa</italic> components in the early development of arteriosclerosis using the Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice in a chronic inflammatory state.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results demonstrated that systemic challenge of Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice with live <italic>Aa</italic>, H.K. <italic>Aa</italic>, or <italic>Aa</italic> LPS accelerates atherogenic plaque formation. Furthermore, the exacerbation of atherosclerosis by <italic>Aa</italic> may involve a considerable degree of enhancement of innate immune signaling and LDL oxidation.</p>

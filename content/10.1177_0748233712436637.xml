<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<italic>Silybum marianum </italic>(L.) (milk thistle) is an important medicinal species in the family Asteraceae. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>marianum</italic> L. is a native of Southern Europe to Asia, specially cultivated for its seeds throughout the world. In Pakistan, it occurs as a weed in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the names of Unt katara, Poli and Karaiza, respectively. The medicinal part of the plant is its ripe seed that contains silymarin, consisting of silybin, silidianin and silichrystin. Silibinin, one the active components of silymarin, can regenerate the damaged hepatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712436637">Al-Anati et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712436637">Jayaraj et al., 2007</xref>). Besides hepatoprotection, silibinin and its other components are also efficient as anticancerous against human breast carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, human adenocarcinoma and colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712436637">Bhatia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233712436637">Hogan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233712436637">Mokhtari, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233712436637">Sharma et al., 2003</xref>). Silymarin a combination of four active components influenced the production of superoxide dismutase, which is a potent antioxidant especially against toxic free radicals in hepatic tissues induced by alcohol. In addition, silymarin can efficiently reduce the leukotrienes action, which can damage hepatic tissues. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712436637">Chevallier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233712436637">Nice, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233712436637">Weiss and Fintelmann, 2000</xref>). Recently, silymarin has shown its potential as anticholesterolaemic agent. Silymarin is also known to stimulate the enzyme RNA polymerase in the nucleus of liver cells, which has regenerative effect on liver. This results in enhancing ribosomal protein synthesis, which is helpful in regenerating hepatocytes.</p>
<p>During stress conditions or incomplete body metabolism, toxic free radicals are produced. These toxic radicals are the products of oxidation reactions, which further start chain reactions and damage body cells and sometimes cause serious diseases like cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233712436637">Ahmad et al., 2011b</xref>). Antioxidants (natural and synthetic) are those compounds that completely stop or reduce the speed of oxidation reactions. Different antioxidants can efficiently detoxify toxic free radicals and stop the chain reactions by undergoing oxidization themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233712436637">Ahmad et al., 2011c</xref>). As a result, antioxidants like thiols, ascorbic acid or polyphenols are often used as reducing agents.</p>
<p>Secondary metabolites are the main active ingredients of a medicinal plant, one of the groups are phenolics that act as an important antioxidant agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436637">Khanavi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233712436637">Weiss and Fintelmann, 2000</xref>). These secondary substances are released naturally during different plant growth phases, some of the active agents that are produced against stress conditions are reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion radicals and nonfree radicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712436637">Ahmad et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233712436637">Ramarathnam et al., 1995</xref>). Natural antioxidants have become a major and interesting area of scientific research nowadays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233712436637">Demo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233712436637">Sanchez-Moreno et al., 1999</xref>). Natural antioxidants, especially present in medicinal plants, exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antiallergic and vasodilatory activities. Antioxidants of plants origin are also used as anticancer, antimutagenic and antiaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712436637">Cook and Samman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712436637">Mandal and Gupta, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The main objective of the current study is to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity) of different parts of <italic>S. marianum </italic>to find new potential sources of natural antioxidants, which were subjected to extraction using methanol as a solvent and to compare their highest antioxidant potential in different parts.</p>

<title>Preparation of the extract</title>
<p>Dried materials of different parts and seeds of <italic>S. marianum</italic> were ground and sieved to get fine powder from which the extracts were prepared. Methanolic extract of the plant was obtained by taking 10 g of powdered material in a separate container. Fifty milliliter of methanol was added to the powdered material and kept for 1 week with periodic shaking (the soaked material was stirred every 18 h using a sterilized glass rod), filtered, and the filtrate was collected. This procedure was repeated three times with fresh volume of methanol. The filtrates were pooled. The final extracts were passed through Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Whatman Ltd., England). The pooled methanol extracts were concentrated separately by rotary vacuum evaporator at 40°C and evaporated to dryness and stored at 4°C in an air-tight bottle (Ahmad et al., 2010b). The extracts obtained from each part were dissolved in methanol independently to get stock solutions. The stock solution was prepared by dissolving pure extract of 5 mg in 20 ml of methanol independently.</p>

<title>DPPH free radical scavenging activity</title>
<p>DPPH scavenging activity in different parts of purple and white flowering varieties of <italic>S. marianum</italic> was measured using the stable radical (DPPH) in terms of hydrogen donating or radical scavenging ability. DPPH (1.25 mg) was dissolved in 40 ml (×4) of methanol to make a stock solution. Plant extract of 5.0 mg was dissolved in 20 ml of methanol to make a stock solution. The procedure was repeated for each plant tissues. Sample solution of 0.5 ml was added to 1 ml of DPPH solution separately. These solutions were kept at room temperature in the dark for 30 min (incubation period). After an interval of 30 min, the absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer at 517 nm. Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging activity using the equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712436637">Ahmad et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233712436637">2010b</xref>):<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0748233712436637">

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The significance of natural antioxidants lies in the fact that these vital substances prevent the oxidation chain reactions and protect the body from induced oxidative stress of toxic free radicals. In fact, toxic free radicals attack on nucleic acid substances such as DNA and RNA, leading to mutational events. These toxic radicals also attacked enzymes, proteins and lipids causing degenerative diseases. Natural antioxidants from different tissues of medicinal plants function as free-radical scavengers and chain breakers, complexes of pro-oxidant metal ions and quenchers of singlet-oxygen formation. <italic>S. marianum</italic> L. also contains the flavonoids called silymarin and is famous in curing a whole range of liver and gall bladder disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233712436637">Weiss and Fintelmann, 2000</xref>). Similarly, various tissues of <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> L. exhibit higher antioxidant activities than vitamin C and E. Its extracts possess a significant scavenging activity against DPPH free radical and an inhibitory effect on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The thrust of the present research work was to evaluate the antioxidant activity in different parts and also to assess and compare the phenotypic difference between purple and white varieties of <italic>S. marianum</italic>. Percentage free radical scavenging activity in different parts of <italic>S. marianum</italic> was recorded in a time-dependent manner. The phenotypic difference between purple and white flowering varieties of<italic> S. marianum</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233712436637">Figure 2</xref>. There was no or less significant difference between different parts of both types of plants. The data were recorded in triplicates and the mean values are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233712436637">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Antioxidant activity was carried out to determine the antioxidant potential of different tissues and compare it with each other. Seeds of purple flowering variety of <italic>S. marianum</italic> had shown a significantly higher activity to detoxify DPPH free radicals when compared with other parts collected from wild plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748233712436637">Figure 3</xref>). According to our data, the seeds of purple flowering variety of<italic> S. marianum</italic> have higher antioxidant activity (78.34%) than the seeds of white flowering variety of <italic>S. marianum</italic> (49.18%). The data were collected after 10, 20 and 30 min time intermittent to compare the highest antioxidant activity. From the comparison, after 10-, 20- and 30-min intervals, it was concluded that at 30 min, the antioxidant activity was high. Seeds of <italic>S. marianum</italic> with purple flower showed 62.67, 74.02 and 78.34% activity after 10, 20 and 30 min, respectively, while white flowering seeds exhibit 37.79, 42.97 and 49.18% activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233712436637">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748233712436637">4</xref>). From the experiment, it was concluded that the plant’s secondary metabolites scavenge more free radicals after 30 min than 10 min, as the time interval and incubation period increase, the plant extract scavenge more free radicals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233712436637">Tawaha et al.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Different tissues of important medicinal plant <italic>S. marianum</italic> L. were subjected to extractions with solvent methanol. Highest antioxidant potential was found in methanolic extract of purple seed variety followed by young leaves of white seed variety. From the experiment, it was observed that these plant parts have certain important constituents that are responsible for radical scavenging activity. <italic>S. marianum</italic> can regenerate the damaged hepatic tissues through scavenging the harmful radicals by neutralizing them. Active components of silymarin also influence the production of superoxide dismutase enzymes, a powerful antioxidant especially active in destroying free radicals caused by alcohol in the liver. Radical scavenging activity was observed when discoloration occurred. Seeds were observed to have high discoloration followed by roots and young and mature leaves. When the difference in the results was high between the DPPH solution and the sample, the percentage free radical activity is high or the sample was highly potential to scavenge the free radical of DPPH. This study reveals that the tested plant materials have significant free radical scavenging activity. The result of the present study suggests that these plant materials especially seeds can be used as a source of antioxidants for different diseases.</p>

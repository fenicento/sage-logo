<abstract>
<p>A large variety of metal forming processes is required in manufacturing for automotive applications. Traditionally, the design process for metal forming tools is based on trial-and-error and on the skill of experienced die-makers. This approach results in high development cost and long lead-times. Especially, the drum clutch requires tight dimensional accuracy in inside diameter and gear shape because it is used as the main component for the automatic transmission. The drum clutch investigated in this study is formed in five forming steps, which are first deep drawing, second deep drawing, restriking, embossing, and Grob processes. Dimensional accuracy of the final products greatly depends upon how much more accurate pre-form is manufactured in the previous forming processes before the Grob process. The deep drawing, restriking, and embossing processes in which the pre-form is formed are very important and decisive steps. Thus in some cases, excessive strain by these operations causes dimensional inaccuracy and cracks initiated from the base and wall of the product.</p>
<p>Based on the above background, the objective of this study is to optimize the pre-form shape and tooling so that excessive thinning and crack formation are avoided while a sharp corner radius and flatness are obtained. Process variables such as the punch shapes both of first and second deep drawing, and punch angle were selected to evaluate the deformation characteristics. The optimum parameters were determined from forming simulations using commercial finite element method codes, DEFORM-2D, specifically developed for metal forming simulation. Finally, experiments for the whole drum clutch forming processes were carried out to verify the optimized forming parameters and the analytical results.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211417495"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>At present, most of the automobile components responsible for providing rotatory motion, such as gears and clutches, are produced through cutting processes such as hobbing, shaping, and shaving under the demand that they be highly precise, highly robust, and highly durable. However, metal plasticity processing methods such as drawing, extruding, and forging are being actively conducted in order to replace traditional processing, for the purpose of increasing the productivity of the components.</p>
<p>Plastic working has the advantages of bringing about high productivity, low rates of material consumption, low costs of production per product, and a high quality of the products themselves. A number of developments of higher value-added plasticity processing techniques have been made recently in order to meet the demands for higher competitive power of the products. Among those techniques, the deep-drawing processing for cylindrical containers, which make use of thin plates whose surface area is much larger than their thickness, is difficult to implement particularly due to the measurement precision and forming load. Technical developments are being made through various forms of research that utilize finite element (FE) method and a number of experiments based on basic theories on this topic.</p>
<p>The automobile drum clutch hub, for which this research focuses on developing the preform, is a main component that directly affects torque transmission needed for automobile movement and that is directly related to the overall quality of automobile performance. Products have been manufactured based on the recommendation for a new preliminary forming process required for developing precise products demanded by the automotive industry with respect to the preforms of drum clutch hubs that are manufactured in progressive dies. These products are expected to increase the degree of precision in the manufacture of drum clutch hubs by solving the corner filling problem that has been regarded the most difficult to solve in existing deep-drawing processes. Moreover, they are expected to be applied to other deep-drawing processes to manufacture highly precise deep-drawing products.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954406211417495"><title>2 DRUM CLUTCH HUBS FOR AUTOMOBILE TRANSMISSION</title>
<p>The drum clutch hub, one of the key components in automobile transmission, is directly linked to the efficiency of power transmission and to the level of vibration noises. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211417495">Figure 1</xref> below illustrates a planet carrier with drum clutch hub products, the red dotted lines outlining the final drum clutch hub products. The manufacture of drum clutch hub products consists of importing all needed raw materials from Japan, using these materials to design preform through progressive forming processes, and finally producing the teeth of hub through Grob, Inc. cutting processes. Research results on the design and experiments of the Grob forming process for the manufacture of drum clutch hub products will be provided in a later research paper.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211417495" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Photograph of drum clutch hub products for automobile transmission</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417495-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In 2002, Park <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417495">1</xref></bold>] suggested a novel forming process through controlling metal flow in order to change of the cold forging from conventional deep drawing forming. Hussain <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211417495">2</xref></bold>] analysed the forming process of drum clutch hubs using CAMP<italic>form</italic> and proposed the conditions needed for manufacturing high-quality products. In addition, Abe <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211417495">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417495">4</xref></bold>] conducted researches on the optimal design of multi-stage deep drawing processes for different applications.</p>
<p>In special, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417495">5</xref></bold>] proposed a new press forming process that can replace the Grob forming process. However, the application of the progressive process to the manufacture of clutch hub products results first in the increase in press capacity due to excessive forming load second in a significant rise in the number of processes with respect to certain products, depending on the shapes of those products. In particular, deep-drawing and ironing processes used in the forming of preforms are by themselves unable to bring about sufficient thickness in corner round. Thus, this research article will propose a new shape for preforms to address this problem.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954406211417495"><title>3 DEEP DRAWING PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING PREFORMS</title>
<p>Drum clutch hub products are to be highly precise, highly robust, and highly durable. Changes in the thickness and the distribution of the wall surfaces and the floor surfaces of preforms whose shapes are drum-like are particularly noteworthy as they directly affect the defect in the second process, namely teeth of hub manufacture. Therefore, they are directly responsible for the qualities of the products. Much research has been conducted on the thickness distribution of products, since it is the most considerable matter of concern also in the thin-plate deep-drawing process. Among a number of research papers, those by Romanowki [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417495">6</xref></bold>] and Sellin [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211417495">7</xref></bold>] have shown that the effects the shapes of corner of the die have on the distribution of and changes in thickness are the greatest.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211417495"><title>3.1 FE analysis</title>
<p>The commercial software DEFORM-2D [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211417495">8</xref></bold>] was used in conducting a FE analysis in this research, and conditions for analysis are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211417495">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-0954406211417495"><title>3.2 Forming processes</title>
<p>The forming of clutch drum hub preform is carried out in two steps taking various conditions into consideration, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211417495">Fig. 2</xref>. This research article proposes the reverse-drawing method in which the location and the role of the punch and the die are reversed in the general deep-drawing process. The shape of the corner of the punch and the die was selected as the process variable, as it affects the degree of measurement precision, the forming load, and the resistance to transformation the most in the first stage of the deep-drawing process. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417495">Fig. 3</xref>, the shapes of the corner shape of dies and punch consist of the shape with a taper (a), the shape with a round (b), and the punch shape resulting from three types of dies with a separate taper. Depending on the shape, two steps of forming analysis in the deep-drawing process were carried out.

<p>The decrease in thickness of drawing product is generally accepted to be a natural result of the execution of the drawing process. However, in the case of drum clutch hub products, designing the shape of the preform for the purpose of increasing the thickness of corner is crucial, since a sufficient thickness of corner is necessary to successfully carry out forming teeth of hub of the final products. This research analysed a number of possibilities in order to ensure sufficient thickness in deep-drawing processes, and proposes a new profile to be used in deep-drawing forming processes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417495">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the decrease in the corner area in the case when the mould shape is circular in existing deep-drawing forming processes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211417495">Figure 4</xref> shows that the thickness of the material is decreased by at least 15 per cent from the initial thickness of 3.0<italic>t</italic>. In order to prevent such a decrease in the thickness of the corner area, this research made use of preform with multiple tapers in carrying out the analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417495">Figure 5</xref> below shows the shape of the proposed perform of first drawing.
<fig id="fig4-0954406211417495" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Decrease in corner thickness of the deep-drawing preform when the conventional round-shape die is applied</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417495-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig5-0954406211417495" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The proposed profile of the first drawing preform in this study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417495-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417495">Figure 6</xref> shows only a 1 per cent decrease, from a thickness of 3.0 to 2.97 mm of the material, with respect to the decrease in the size of the corner area. Thus, the proposed shape of the preform can be expected to prevent the decrease in the thickness of final drawing product. For the purpose of comparison, analysis as shown in the summary chart below has been performed, and its results are as follows. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417495">Figure 7</xref> illustrates transformation phases in two-stage deep-drawing processes, depending on the shape of each corner of dies and punch.

<fig id="fig7-0954406211417495" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of forming behaviour according to three types of preforms: (a) forming behaviour using the conventional taper-shaped preform; (b) forming behaviour using the conventional round-shaped preform; and (c) forming behaviour using the proposed multi-tapered preform</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417495-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As shown in the figure, in the case of shape (a) with one layer of taper, although the material located at the central floor surface area is moved to the wall surface area and increases the level of measurement precision, it not only generates folding due to considerable irregularities in transformation phases, but also may lead to the manufacture of defective products during Grob forming for forming teeth of hub due to a high value of the drawing ratio. Thus, shape (a) is not an appropriate shape to be used in the manufacture of the preforms of clutch drum hub products. Shape (b), which has a round, is also inappropriate, since the separation of the metal flow at the corner area, one of the key measurement areas, is the cause of the decrease in thickness, as shown in (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211417495">2</xref>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211417495">Fig. 8</xref>. On the other hand, shape (c), which has a separate taper, is the best among the three shapes, since the even distribution of materials in shape (c) meets the measurement requirements in the corner area and does not cause such problems as folding.

<sec id="sec6-0954406211417495"><title>4 OPTIMAL DESIGN OF PREFORM SHAPE USING TAGUCHI METHOD</title>
<p>The Taguchi method was used to produce optimally designed preform with multiple tapers <bold>[</bold><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211417495">9</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211417495">11</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>. The Taguchi method consists of getting data for design variables using the table of orthogonal arrays and computing the signal-to-noise (SN) ratio using these data to determine the optimal value. SN ratio that takes into account both the mean and the distribution of the objective function, the SN ratio is the ratio of the expected value of the square of the population mean to the expected value of the variance. All the steps in the Taguchi method are intended to decrease the value of the distribution. The lower the value of the distribution, the higher the SN ratio. The SN ratio is defined by the characteristics of nominal the best, smaller the best, and larger the better, depending on problems. In the forming process used in this research, the SN ratio used has the characteristic of smaller the best, meaning lower the effective stress and effective strain that depend on material transformation is better. In this case, the SN ratio is represented by equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211417495">2</xref>).
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0954406211417495"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417495-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>n</italic> denotes the number of repetitions and <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> the reaction value. General sensitivity analysis makes use of the analysis of variance on SN ratios to evaluate the considerable effects design variables have on SN ratios. The reproducibility of the optimal level is evaluated in comparison with what is expected to be the optimal value, obtained from a confirming experiment. Experiment conditions are then standardized.</p>
<p>This research replaced the preliminary experiment with the FE simulation and took into account the five process variables, namely <italic>R</italic>1 (mm), <italic>R</italic>2 (mm), <italic>θ</italic>1 (degrees), <italic>θ</italic>2 (degrees), and <italic>θ</italic>3 (degrees) in table of orthogonal arrays L27 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211417495">12</xref></bold>]. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211417495">Table 3</xref> lists the five process variables and shows the four levels used in this research. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954406211417495">Table 4</xref> provides the experiment results of L27.

It can be seen that, the characteristics of each reaction value get better as the size and level of the sensitivity of process variables decrease to Multi taper angle <italic>θ</italic>2(X4) and Multi taper angle <italic>θ</italic>3(X5) and increase to Round Radius <italic>R</italic>1(X1), Round Radius <italic>R</italic>2(X2), and Multi taper angle <italic>θ</italic>1(X3). Thus, it can be seen that the maximum stress and the maximum strain of final product decrease when Multi taper angle <italic>θ</italic>2(X4) and Multi taper angle <italic>θ</italic>3(X5) are decreased, as Round Radius <italic>R</italic>1(X1), Round Radius <italic>R</italic>2(X2), and Multi taper angle θ1(X3) are increased.

Deviation is the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of the effects of the process variables at each level, and contribution is represented by the percentage to the sum of all deviation. It is obvious that the process variables that have the bigger significant effects on hub forming are Round Radius <italic>R</italic>1(X1), Multi taper angle <italic>θ</italic>1(X3), and Multi taper angle <italic>θ</italic>2(X4). Furthermore, the optimal conditions of the process variables to minimize the maximum stress are <italic>R</italic>1 = 50 mm, <italic>R</italic>2 = 50 mm, <italic>θ</italic>1 = 20°, <italic>θ</italic>2 = 20°, and <italic>θ</italic>3 = 70°.

<sec id="sec9-0954406211417495"><title>5.2 Reproducibility evaluation</title>
<p>Reproducibility evaluation estimates the expected reaction value from selected process variables. It selects those process variables with the most favourable effects on the SN ratio, and estimates the SN ratio and the average reaction from a few combinations of the other process variables. If there is a discrepancy between the expected reaction and the experimental values, one may assume that there is an error in reciprocal action and experiment. The fundamental concept of estimation is to continue to further effects. This is termed additivity of the variable effect. The SN ratio is the reciprocal of unit variation distribution. Thus, it is due to additivity that the SN ratio is expressed in the form of square.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0954406211417495">Table 6</xref> compares estimated values with the values under the optimal condition (<italic>R</italic>1 = 50 mm, <italic>R</italic>2 = 50 mm, <italic>θ</italic>1 = 20°, <italic>θ</italic>2 = 20°, and <italic>θ</italic>3 = 70°). Reproducibility can be thought to be sufficient, since the values in comparison differ very slightly.

<p>This research proposed a new preform shape that enables the prevention of the decrease in corner-area measurements during the two-stage deep-drawing process of automobile clutch drum hub performs. In addition, this research focused on the effects the resulting moulds, namely the shape of corner of the lower die and the upper punch, has on the thickness of the corner area of the product. The results of the process design were then taken into consideration to produce moulds and carry out experiments for the manufacture of products and succeeded in making products of high quality. The conclusions from this research are as follows.

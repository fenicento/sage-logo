<abstract>
<p>This study characterized individuals dying from illicit and nonillicit drug overdoses in Utah. Data were gathered from medical examiner records, death certificates, and next-of-kin interviews, 2008-2009. Among 374 decedents, 92 (25%) involved illicit drugs, 244 (65%) involved nonillicit drugs, and 38 (10%) involved a combination of both as the cause of death. Nonillicit compared with illicit drug-related decedents were more likely older, married, and of normal or overweight, and had a history of chronic pain. Nonillicit drug-related decedents were less likely to have had a history of alcohol and/or illicit drug use. Nevertheless, most decedents in both drug categories had a history of alcohol drinking and illicit substance use. Several psychological maladies characterized both illicit and nonillicit decedent cases, with a majority experiencing past anxiety, sadness, pain, insomnia, mood swings, irritability, hopelessness, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Impulsive tendencies and mood swings were more common in illicit drug-related deaths.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The United States has experienced an unprecedented increase in the number of unintentional drug overdoses over the last decade. From 2003 through 2007 the age-adjusted drug-induced death rate per 100,000 increased from 7.0 to 9.3 (33%) for females and 12.8 to 15.8 (23%) for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612462217">Paulozzi, 2011</xref>). During 2007, the number of drug-induced deaths reached 38,371 in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612462217">Paulozzi, 2011</xref>). During 2005, for the first time people aged 45 to 54 years were more likely to die of drug overdoses than traffic crashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612462217">Paulozzi, 2008</xref>). National research conducted through Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that the increase in deaths was primarily from prescription drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612462217">CDC, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612462217">Paulozzi, Budnitz, &amp; Xi, 2006</xref>). The most common drugs involved in prescription drug deaths were opioid painkillers (e.g., oxycodone, methadone, hydrocodone) and psychotherapeutic drugs (e.g., diazepam; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612462217">Paulozzi, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612462217">2011</xref>). The number of deaths involving opioids was approximately double the number involving cocaine and 5 times higher than deaths involving heroin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612462217">CDC, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The age-adjusted (2000 U.S. standard) rate of poisoning deaths in Utah increased from 12.7 in 1999 to 21.0 in 2009 (65% increase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612462217">Utah Department of Health [UDOH], 2010</xref>). The poisoning death rate surpassed the motor vehicle crash death rate in Utah by 13% in 2002 (15.2 vs. 13.4 per 100,000) and by 141% in 2009 (21.0 vs. 8.7 per 100,000). In addition, in 2009, poisoning deaths were the leading cause of death in the Utah population ages 15 through 64. In 2009, approximately 80% of Utah poisoning deaths included prescription pain relievers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612462217">UDOH, 2010</xref>, unpublished data).</p>
<p>A limited number of studies have been published regarding differences between illicit and nonillicit drug users and overdose deaths, and frequently, these groups are combined in analyses. When studies on use of illicit and nonillicit drugs among high school students are conducted, students are often either treated as one group or differentiated by using few demographic characteristics, regardless of drug type implicated in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612462217">Kandel &amp; Yamaguchi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612462217">Kokkevi &amp; Stefanis, 1991</xref>). This categorization is valuable for determining overall trends in drug use. However, fundamental differences exist between illicit and nonillicit drugs, including how they are obtained and purposes of use that might merit considering nonillicit and illicit decedents as separate groups when designing interventions or describing populations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to better understand unique characteristics of persons who died from unintentional illicit and nonillicit drug overdoses. Insights are provided by in-depth interviewers of those who knew the decedent best. Potentially distinguishing characteristics include demographics, previous alcohol or tobacco use, physical and mental health status, and illicit substance use. Analyses were performed on the basis of data obtained from medical examiners, death certificates, and interviews.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0022042612462217">
<title>Population</title>
<p>Decedents were selected among persons who had died in Utah from October 26, 2008, to October 25, 2009, and who were listed within the jurisdiction of the office of the medical examiner (OME). Manner and causes of death (COD) were determined by OME on the basis of scene-of-death investigation, autopsy, and toxicology findings. Decedents were included in the study if they were Utah residents aged 12 years or older, experienced an unintentional (inadvertent or undetermined) death, had a drug listed as the COD, and did not have a violent event related to their death (e.g., fall, drowning). Decedents were double hand coded by using the specific drug listed as CODs according to OMEs. For the decedents with unspecified drug use according to COD, OME case files were examined to determine specific drugs. Because heroin is metabolized into morphine in the body, for the decedents with morphine listed as a COD without a specified source of the drug, further review was completed to determine whether the toxicological result was as a result of morphine or heroin use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022042612462217">
<title>Design Overview</title>
<p>A questionnaire was designed to document information about decedents from those who knew the decedents best, in the recent past and over their lifetime. The questionnaire was developed over the course of several months through meetings with the research team. Where standard questions already existed in validated studies (e.g., demographic questions from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System), these questions were used. Feedback was obtained from professionals in the fields of medicine, pain management, and public health. The data collection instrument (questionnaire) was developed for use as a phone-based survey to be administered by a trained interviewer. Prior to data collection, the research team met weekly for a period of 1 month to train interviewers, practice questionnaire administration, and refine questionnaire format. The questionnaire was also pre-tested to establish face validity with a small sample (<italic>n</italic> = 7) of volunteers who had experienced the death of a family member due to drug overdose or suicide.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted by trained interviewers by telephone with persons who were identified by OME death-scene investigators as either next of kin or the best person to contact. The OME identified those who best knew the decedent in the recent past and over their lifetime. In most cases, this was the same person, but in 33 instances, two people were identified as being appropriate to contact. When necessary, additional contact information was sought for potential interviewees with nonworking phone numbers by contacting funeral homes and law enforcement agencies. Interviewees were contacted at least 1 month after the date of death. The average length of the interviews was 20 to 30 min. Interviewers followed scripts for introducing the questionnaire, leaving telephone messages, and responding to participants’ study-related questions. Interviewers referred all participants’ case-specific questions to OME.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022042612462217">
<title>Data Management</title>
<p>Epi Info™, Version 3.5.1, was used for data entry of the completed questionnaires. Whenever more than one interview was completed for the same decedent, answers from multiple interviews were merged into one set of answers for the decedent. Merging was completed following a predetermined logic to decide which response was to be assigned for data entry when conflicting answers were received. Logic was designed to accept an answer that provided a greater amount of information. Decedents with multiple interviews were tracked, and the number of questions with conflicting answers among multiple interviews was recorded and entered into the survey database. The average number of conflicting responses per case was 13, with a range of 4 to 24 conflicting responses among all cases with multiple interviews. Almost all of these conflicting responses were resolved using the predetermined logic. In the few situations where the differences were not resolved, the responses were treated as missing.</p>
<p>Double entry was completed for all questionnaires. The two databases were compared electronically, and all discrepancies were reviewed for accuracy. Corrections were made manually in the master database.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the UDOH on July 16, 2008.</p>

<sec id="section6-0022042612462217">
<title>Statistical Techniques</title>
<p>Frequency distributions were calculated and compared among groups by using the chi-square test for independence. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between type of drug implicated in death and selected variables. Two-sided tests of significance and confidence intervals were conducted on the basis of α = .05. Analyses were performed by using SAS<sup>®</sup> Version 9.3 (© 2002-2011, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Among the 2,086 cases of medical examiners reviewed, 432 (21%) involved unintentional drug overdose as the cause of death. Next-of-kin interviews were not obtained for 47 decedents because of refusal (<italic>n</italic> = 10), inability to contact (<italic>n</italic> = 34), or language barriers (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Among the 385 decedents where next-of-kin interviews were completed, information was not available regarding drug type involved in death for 11 decedents. Analyses were performed on the basis of 374 decedents for which interview and drug information were obtained. Among the 374 decedents, 92 (25%) involved illicit-only drugs, 244 (65%) involved nonillicit-only drugs, and 38 (10%) involved a combination of both. No significant difference between interviewed and noninterviewed next of kin with respect to age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, urban/rural residence, or illicit/nonillicit drug-related overdose was determined.</p>
<p>A comparison among illicit, nonillicit, and a combination of both illicit and nonillicit drug overdose decedents by selected demographic variables and body mass index (BMI) is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612462217">Table 1</xref>. Decedents with an illicit drug implicated in their death were substantially more likely, when compared with nonillicit drug decedents, to be men, aged 18 to 24 years, Hispanic, never married or previously married, and underweight. In a logistic regression model, sex, ethnicity, marital status, and BMI were simultaneously significantly associated with whether the drug overdose involved illicit or nonillicit drugs. A history of physical abuse and sexual abuse were each separately added to the model but were inconsequential and subsequently dropped.</p>

<p>A history of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and hallucinogens was reported in 48%, 24%, 17%, 23%, and 11% of nonillicit drug-related deaths, respectively.

A history of tobacco smoking did not significantly differ among the three decedent drug overdose categories. However, a history of alcohol drinking was significantly greater among those who died from an illicit drug overdose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612462217">Table 2</xref>). Previous consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs was associated with the greatest likelihood of having died from an illicit drug overdose, followed by a history of just illicit drugs and then just alcohol consumption. Decedent cases with no history of alcohol drinking or illicit drug use all died from a nonillicit drug overdose (<italic>n</italic> = 24).</p>

<p>The percentage of decedent cases having experienced selected psychological conditions are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022042612462217">Figure 1</xref>. The majority of cases had a history of anxiety, sadness, pain, insomnia, mood swings, irritability, hopelessness, and greater than normal daytime sleepiness. Only impulsiveness (<italic>p</italic> = .011) and mood swings (<italic>p</italic> = .013) were significantly associated with the type of drug implicated in their death (i.e., illicit, nonillicit, or a combination of the two drug types), after adjusting for age and sex. Both mood swings and impulsiveness were more strongly associated with illicit drug overdose deaths than nonillicit drug overdose deaths.</p>

<p>A lifetime history of chronic physical pain was reported among a majority of decedents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612462217">Table 3</xref>). A history of physical pain was substantially associated with death from a nonillicit drug overdose after adjusting for age and sex. Among decedents with a history of physical pain, acute pain was substantially associated with a greater chance of dying from an illicit drug overdose. In addition, prescription pain medication use was substantially greater among decedents dying from a nonillicit drug overdose; however, 65% of those dying of an illicit drug overdose had a history of using prescription pain medication.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The likelihood that an overdose death involved an illicit drug was simultaneously significantly greater among men, Hispanics, never/previously married, and underweight individuals. The higher percentage of illicit drug decedents being men is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612462217">Kandel, Yamaguchi, &amp; Chen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612462217">Mueller, Shah, &amp; Landen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612462217">Paulozzi, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612462217">2011</xref>). A study carried out in 2007 by a medical examiner in Utah found that males accounted for 78% of illicit drug overdoses that resulted in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612462217">Paulozzi, 2008</xref>). In contrast, the percentage of males who died from nonillicit drugs (54%) in 2007 was nearly the same as the number of females.</p>
<p>A study conducted in New Mexico likewise found a higher proportion of Hispanic illicit drug overdose deaths (63%) to White illicit drug overdose deaths (31%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612462217">Mueller et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Illicit drug-related deaths reflected a smaller percentage of married individuals than did nonillicit drug-related deaths. This finding has been demonstrated in other studies, where increased risk of substance use has been associated with divorce and separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612462217">Lex, 1994</xref>), and married persons are less likely to use illicit drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612462217">Heinz, Wu, Witkiewitz, Epstein, &amp; Preston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612462217">Kaestner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612462217">Merline, O’Malley, Schulenberg, Bachman, &amp; Johnston, 2004</xref>). In addition, being single increases the risk for a drug overdose, particularly among persons previously married. A North Carolina study revealed that divorced persons had the highest percentage of nonillicit drug overdose deaths (36%), compared with never-married or currently married persons. In addition, 25% of nonillicit drug users had never been married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612462217">Whitmire &amp; Adams, 2010</xref>). In Shasta County, California, 60% of drug-induced deaths occurred among persons who were either single or divorced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612462217">County of Shasta Health and Human Services Agency, 2008</xref>). A New Jersey study indicated that 51% of unintentional overdoses and 32% of intentional overdoses occurred among persons who had never been married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612462217">Hempstead, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Decedents who died from an illicit drug overdose were more likely underweight, compared with those who died from nonillicit drugs. Underweight status could also be associated with illicit drug overdose because of its association with lower socioeconomic standing (i.e., persons without health insurance who have reduced access to prescription drugs, seek medical care less frequently, and suffer from a diminished overall nutritional status; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612462217">Marzuk et al., 1997</xref>). Lack of access to health care combined with financial difficulties that prevent the purchase of higher cost nutritious food could link underweight status to illicit drug overdose. In addition, underweight people who take drugs require less of the drug to overdose (weight-dose response). They may also be underweight because they eat less and spend more of what they have on drugs and not on food (especially with cocaine and methamphetamines, as well as heroin).</p>
<p>Decedents in all drug categories had an advanced level of previous alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substance use. Dying from an illicit drug overdose was associated with a history of alcohol consumption and illicit substance use; decedents who had died from a nonillicit drug overdose also had an advanced level of past illicit drug use. This finding is similar to results of other studies that demonstrated an association between use of illicit and nonillicit drugs during a person’s lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612462217">Grant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612462217">Kandel et al., 1992</xref>). Previous research has demonstrated that persons who started smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking illicit drugs as adolescents often progressed to the use of prescribed psychoactive drugs as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612462217">Kandel et al., 1992</xref>). A case-control study involving Vietnam-era male twins, based on data collected in 1992, demonstrated that persons who began drinking alcohol as adolescents were more likely to use nonillicit or illicit drugs later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612462217">Grant et al., 2006</xref>). Another study reported that history of alcohol abuse and illicit drug use were strong predictors of opioid abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612462217">Turk, Swanson, &amp; Gatchel, 2008</xref>). The link between illicit and nonillicit drug use might be explained as a consequence of increased difficulty accessing the adolescent-focused illicit drug market as a person ages. Adolescents might locate and purchase illicit drugs readily through social networks, whereas adults might find obtaining prescription drugs through consultation with a physician easier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612462217">Kandel et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, persons who misuse drugs might misuse both illicit and nonillicit drugs during their lifetime.</p>
<p>In the 2 months preceding their death, the majority of decedents had shown signs of anxiety, sadness, pain, mood swings, insomnia, irritability, hopelessness, and greater than normal daytime sleepiness. Several studies have shown that psychiatric conditions, chronic pain, and stress are associated with deviant drug-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612462217">Akbik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612462217">McLellan &amp; Turner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612462217">Schneier &amp; Siris 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612462217">Turk et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the association between nonillicit and illicit drug use, and mental disorders has been documented in other studies. In a drug-related meta-analysis, individuals with substance-abuse disorders had generally higher rates of mental disorders than those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612462217">Jané-Llopis &amp; Matytsina, 2009</xref>). The researchers showed that an association between drug use and mental disorders was linked to the neurological effects of addictive substances, such as alcohol, which are believed to cause as much as 10% of depression in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612462217">Jané-Llopis &amp; Matytsina, 2009</xref>). However, one New Mexico study of overdose deaths showed that the greatest proportion of prescription overdoses were caused by painkillers and antidepressants, which may indicate a preexisting physical or mental medical condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612462217">Mueller et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, reliance on either illicit or nonillicit drugs may be influenced by, and may contribute to, the development of various mental disorders in both populations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that mood swings and impulsiveness were associated with a greater chance of illicit drug overdose among decedent cases. Abnormal mood swings and impulsiveness are usually associated with mental health disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612462217">Jacobs, 1992</xref>). Individuals experiencing this kind of physical or mental trauma may engage in illicit substance use (cocaine, cannabis, hallucinogens) because they are forms of self-medication that allow patients to easily block out unwanted thoughts and feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612462217">Schneier &amp; Siris, 1987</xref>). Individuals with these mental disorders may also have difficulty finding or keeping a job, so financial difficulty may lead to seeking out illicit drugs on the street, unlike nonillicit drug users who can obtain drugs from their doctor.</p>
<p>Although nonillicit drug decedents were more likely to have a history of chronic pain than illicit drug decedents, the majority in both groups had chronic pain. Conversely, in a 2008 statewide Utah survey of persons who used prescription pain medication during the previous year, only 29% reported that the drugs were prescribed for chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612462217">CDC, 2010</xref>). Accordingly, persons with chronic pain comprise a majority of nonillicit drug decedents, but a minority of those had been prescribed pain medication. Therefore, overdose prevention interventions tailored for chronic pain patients might efficiently be targeted at this relatively small, higher risk group of the population prescribed pain medication.</p>
<p>This study was limited by the potential for recall bias, social desirability bias, and knowledge bias among those interviewed, since awareness of the details of the decedent’s life varied among contacts. Although not available, a comparison group would have strengthened statements about risk factors. In addition, the causal direction between selected sociological factors and illicit or nonillicit drug deaths could not be established with the current study design. Finally, study results were based on the Utah population, which has the lowest overall prevalence of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612462217">CDC, 2012</xref>). Relatively low use of tobacco and alcohol may covary with drug use, thereby influencing external validity. Further research may explore whether a culture that is more likely to proscribe tobacco and alcohol use experiences comparatively different levels of prescription medication abuse.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Illicit drug-related deaths reflect a higher percentage of men, Hispanics, never or previously married, and lower weight individuals than do nonillicit drug-related deaths. The majority of decedents in the illicit and nonillicit classifications experienced anxiety, sadness, pain, mood swings, insomnia, irritability, hopelessness, and greater than normal daytime sleepiness in the 2 months prior to their death. Only mood swings and impulsiveness occurred more frequently in those dying from an illicit drug overdose. Although history of alcohol drinking and illicit drug use was greater among illicit drug-related deaths, and history of prescription pain medication was more common among nonillicit drug-related cases, these substances and pain medication affected most decedent cases in the illicit and nonillicit classifications.</p>

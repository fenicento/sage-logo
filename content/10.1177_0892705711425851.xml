<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Laminated composite plates resting on elastic foundation as structural components play an important and vital role in exceptional performance extreme engineering structures as aeronautical and aerospace engineering for construction, manufacturing of aircrafts structure components, aerospace vehicles, aircraft runways and launching sites of missile and spacecraft. In construction of above mentioned structure/components, there is operational and functional requirement of inherent characteristic ability to tailor structural properties through appropriate lamination schemes for achieving high strength to weight ratio according to use. Nowadays advanced reinforced composites are being widely used in modern aerospace transportation systems and for high performance in other areas also. Plates made up of these composites are often subjected to mechanical loading in hygrothermal environment. Due to boundary constraints in composite plates, varying moisture and temperature environments besides other factors induce significant strains, thereby needs ensuing hygrothermal free vibration behavior. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the hygrothermal free vibration behavior of these structural systems in order to estimate the reserve strength. The deterministic analysis is based on the assumptions that the system properties are completely determinate i.e. only the mean response is considered. The dispersion caused by the randomness in the system parameters is neglected. For reliable design, especially for sensitive application, it is important for the designer to understand and have sound knowledge of structural response. Otherwise the predicted response by deterministic analysis may differ significantly from the actual response which may be the cause of unsafe structure. Considering the above aspects to enhance accuracy in the response evaluation favors a probabilistic analysis for laminated composite by modeling their system properties as random variables (RVs).</p>
<p>Considerable literature is available on the vibration response of conventional structures and composite structures with randomness in system properties. Leissa and Martin<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892705711425851">1</xref>
</sup> have analyzed the vibration and buckling of rectangular composite plates and have studied the effects of variation in fiber spacing using classical laminate theory (CLT). Zhang and Chen<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892705711425851">2</xref>
</sup> have presented a method to estimate the standard deviation (SD) of eigenvalue and eigenvector of random multiple degree of freedom (DOF) system. Zhang and Ellingwood<sup>

A comprehensive summary of extensive literature is available on the response analysis of the structures with deterministic material properties to random excitations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892705711425851">4</xref>
</sup> However, the analysis of the structures with random system properties is not adequately reported in the literature. Manohar and Ibrahim<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892705711425851">5</xref>

The elastic moduli of the system, the stiffness of the Winkler foundation on which the plate rests and the mass density are considered to be uncertain. Given their random field-based description, a new method is presented for the computation of the second-order statistics of the eigen properties of the laminate. Yadav and Verma<sup>

<p>Most recently, the present authors investigated the effect of randomness in system properties on elastic buckling and free vibration of laminated composite plates resting on elastic foundation by assuming the system properties such as Young’s modulus, shear modulus, Poisson’s ratio and foundation parameters are modeled as random inputs variables.

<p>It is evident from the available literature that the studies on the free vibration response of laminated composite plates resting on elastic foundations with random system properties in hygrothermal environment using micromechanical model are not dealt by the researchers. In the present work, an attempt is made to address this problem. The laminated composite plate is analyzed using the <italic>C</italic>
<sup>0</sup> linear FEM with HSDT based on von-Karman linear strain–displacement relations. FOPT approach has been employed for the first time to develop a novel probabilistic solution procedure for random linear problem with a reasonable accuracy. The approach is valid for system properties with small random variations in the system variables compared with the mean value. The condition is satisfied by most engineering materials and it hardly puts any limitation on the approach. The efficacy of the probabilistic approach is examined by comparing the results with an independent Monte Carlo simulation (MCS).</p>

Then the random linear eigenvalue problem is broken up into zeroth- and first-order equations using perturbation technique by neglecting higher-order equations. The zeroth-order linear eigenvalue problem is solved by normal eigen solution procedure and the first-order equation is solved for SD of natural frequency using the Taylor series expansion.

(20)</xref>, that is [<italic>K</italic>], {<italic>q</italic>} and λ are random as well. However, <italic>M</italic> is a constant mass matrix because it relates only the mass densities ρ that is taken as the deterministic in the present analysis. Further, it is quite logical to assume that the random input variables are independent of each other and random part of each input variable is small with respect to its mean value; fortunately, most of the engineering problems including composite materials fall in this category. Based on this, the mean-centered first-order perturbation techniques in which all the system parameters are expanded in Taylor series is used to determine the stochastic characteristics of the linear frequency of laminated composite plates.</p>

<title>Solution approach—SFEM for hygrothermal free vibration problem</title>
<p>Stochastic Finite Element Method (SFEM) approach has been adopted for obtaining the second-order statistics of dimensionless hygrothermal fundamental frequency response of laminated composite plate resting on elastic foundation with randomness in material properties, coefficients of hygroscopic expansion, coefficient of thermal expansion and foundation parameters. The material properties coefficients of hygroscopic expansion, coefficient of thermal expansion and foundation parameters are assumed to be the basic input RVs. Without any loss of generality, the RV can be spite up as the sum of a mean and a zero random part.<sup>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The stochastic finite element analysis has been applied to obtain the mean and Coefficient of Variation (cov), considering different random parameters of the hygrothermal free vibration of laminated composite plate of graphite epoxy material resting on elastic foundations. The lamina coefficients of hygroscopic and thermal expansion including foundation stiffness parameters and material properties are modeled as basic RVs. The mean and SD of the hygrothermal free vibration are obtained considering all the random material input variables and thermal expansion coefficients, moisture expansion coefficients as well as foundation parameters taking separately as basic RVs as stated earlier. However, the results are only presented taking coefficient of variation (<inline-formula id="inline-formula12-0892705711425851">

</inline-formula>) of the system property equal to 0.10. However, the obtained results reveal that the stochastic approach would be valid up to COV = 0.20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0892705711425851">34</xref></sup> as the nature of the SD variation is linear and passing through the origin. Hence, the presented results would be sufficient to extrapolate the results for other COV value, keeping in mind the limitation of FOPT. The thickness of all the lamina is assumed to be constant and of same material without varying individual property of materials used. The results obtained have been compared with MCS and those available in the literature. For the present study, a nine nodded serendipity element, which results in 63 DOF per element modified from HSDT-based <italic>C</italic>
<sup>0</sup> finite element model has been used for discretizing the laminate. Based on convergence, a 4 × 4 mesh has been used throughout for evaluation of the results. Results have been computed by employing the full (3 × 3) integration rule for bending stiffness matrices, hygrothermal load vector and the geometric stiffness matrices and the reduced (2 × 2) integration rule for computing the shear stiffness matrices to avoid shear locking in the thin plates. The boundary conditions for the plate shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0892705711425851">Figure 3</xref> are:</p>

<p>The plate geometry used is characterized by aspect ratios, <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2, and side-to-thickness ratios, <italic>a</italic>/<italic>h</italic> = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 100. The mean values of coefficients of hygroscopic expansion, coefficients of thermal expansion and material constants are used for computation. We now consider a second step as the elastic constants; thermal expansion coefficients and coefficients of hygroscopic expansion of each layers are assumed to be linear functions of temperature and moisture. The only exception is the Poisson’s ratio, which can reasonably be assumed as constant due to the weak dependency on temperature change. For the ratio of the SD to the mean of material and geometric properties varying from 0% to 20%,<sup>

</sup> It is assumed that one of the material property (i.e. <italic>E</italic>
<sub>11</sub>) changes at a time, keeping other as a deterministic with the mean value of the material properties. The present FOPT result obtained using first-order perturbation approach based on HSDT compared with independent MCS approach. For the MCS approach, the samples are generated using Mat Lab to fit the desired mean and SD. These samples used in response are solved repeatedly, adopting conventional eigenvalue procedure, to generate a sample of the hygrothermal free vibration. The number of samples used for MCS approach is 10,000 based on satisfactory convergence of the results. The normal distribution has been assumed for random number generations in MCS. However, the present perturbation approach used in the study does not have any limitation as regard to probability distribution of the system property. This is an advantage over the MCS. From the figure it is clear that close correlation is achieved between two results.</p>

It is seen that the mean hygrothermal fundamental frequency is higher for clamp support compared to other support for with and without rise in temperature and moisture. The coefficient of variation of hygrothermal fundamental frequency is also varied for different combinations of random variables without foundations, Winkler and Pasternak elastic foundations. The mean hygrothermal fundamental frequency for Pasternak elastic foundations further increases and it is higher for clamp support compared to other support for with and without rise in temperature and moisture.

It is observed that the mean hygrothermal fundamental frequency is higher for thin plates and decreases drastically for moderately thick plates resting on Winkler elastic foundation; however the coefficient of variations for different combinations of random variables is also varied with and without rise in temperature and moisture. It is interesting that mean hygrothermal fundamental frequency rises rapidly for thin plate and decreases drastically for moderately thick plates resting on Pasternak elastic foundation in similar environmental conditions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0892705711425851">Table 7</xref>

It is observed that mean hygrothermal fundamental frequency drastically increases for cross-ply antisymmetric plate, whereas there is a sharp decrease of other lamina lay-up when the plate is resting on Winkler elastic foundations under given environmental conditions; however the coefficient of variation of hygrothermal fundamental frequency also vary for different combinations of random variables. The mean and coefficient of variation of hygrothermal fundamental frequency further vary for different combinations of random variables and the plate is resting on Pasternak elastic foundation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A <italic>C</italic>
<sup>0</sup> FEM in conjunction with FOPT is employed to compute the mean and COV of the hygrothermal fundamental frequency of the laminated composite plate with random change in all input variables, aspect ratios and Winkler and Pasternak elastic foundations. Assumptions are made for uniform distribution of temperature and moisture over entire surface and through the thickness of laminated composite plate. The following main things are concluded from the limited present investigation.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The first-order perturbation technique gives acceptable results for the range of COV taken in the study. It is observed that COV for <italic>E</italic>
<sub>11</sub> and <italic>E</italic>
<sub>22</sub> is of significance compared to all other random input variables in case plates resting on Winkler and Pasternak foundations.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The characteristics of hygrothermal fundamental frequency of laminated composite plate is significantly influenced by various support conditions, plate thickness ratios, aspect ratios, volume fraction, elastic foundations, temperature and moisture changes. The mean and COV of fundamental frequency plate is significant when the plate is subjected to hygrothermoelastic material properties.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The clamp-supported plate vibrates at slightly higher temperature and moisture compared to other supports when resting on Pasternak elastic foundation. Vibration is less dominant in moderately thick plate compared to thin plate. It is also noticed that with Pasternak foundation support the mean fundamental frequency is higher and COV of fundamental frequency is lower compared to Winkler foundation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The sensitivity of hygrothermal fundamental frequency, COV due to variation in material properties, is dependent on thickness ratio and boundary conditions of the laminate. The study is meaningful for the aerospace applications where such environmental conditions may occur besides other factors. The importance of elastic foundations on which laminated composite plate is resting is quite important from the design point of view.</p>

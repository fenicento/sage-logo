<abstract>
<p>Hospital discharge planning for older adults is an essential component to successful transitional care and will become increasingly important as hospitals face financial penalties for avoidable readmissions. This study reports a cross-sectional descriptive web-based survey study about challenges to discharge planning experienced by hospitals in the Midwestern state of Missouri. Problems identified by respondents included difficulties finding placement for patients requiring ventilator care, hemodialysis, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, wound vacuums, or who have mental health care needs. In general, urban hospitals reported more problems with finding postacute discharge destinations for patients than did rural hospitals. It is essential that nursing homes, residential care facilities, and home health agencies be adequately reimbursed to manage complex patients. It may be equally important to identify ways to develop critical assessment and care management skills that are needed in postacute staff to increase the likelihood that patients will be accepted at the time of hospital discharge.</p>

<p>The discharge planning process has challenged the health care systems for decades. Concerns about hospital readmission rates in excess of 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773812436373">Jencks, Williams, &amp; Coleman, 2009</xref>) create the impetus for health care reform initiatives designed to improve transitional care processes, of which discharge planning is a key component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812436373">American Association of Retired Persons [AARP], 2010</xref>). It is essential that hospitals manage transitional care because starting in 2012 Medicare payments to hospitals will be reduced for avoidable readmissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812436373">AARP, 2010</xref>). Older adults comprise 38% of hospital discharges, annually consume 43% of total days of hospital care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773812436373">DeFrancis, Lucus, Buie, &amp; Golosinsky, 2008</xref>), and have an average length of stay (LOS) of 5.5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773812436373">DeFrancis et al., 2008</xref>). By 2030 there will be 70 million adults aged 66 and older, roughly double the current population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1054773812436373">Vincent &amp; Velkoff, 2010</xref>). Older adults require impeccable discharge plans because they often live alone, have multiple chronic conditions, functional limitations, and may need assistance with household tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773812436373">Hays, 2002</xref>). In the United States, family provides the majority of care and services to older adults after hospital discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1054773812436373">Popejoy, Galambos, &amp; Moylan, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, service availability varies by geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773812436373">Chan, Hart, &amp; Goodman, 2006</xref>). Currently, a number of health care reform initiatives are being proposed to help create programs to improve discharge planning and transitional care from hospitals to manage poor outcomes such as readmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812436373">AARP, 2010</xref>). For transitions from hospitals to be successful there must be available and adequate services to support patients and families after hospitalizations. This study was conducted to explore the problems encountered by health care professionals involved in hospital discharge planning in both urban rural locations across Missouri and to prepare for a future discharge planning intervention study.</p>
<sec id="section1-1054773812436373">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Hospital discharge planning is inherently complex due to the number of stakeholders (patients, family, health care team members) involved, and the challenges associated with finding care and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1054773812436373">Popejoy et al., 2010</xref>). Interdisciplinary communication about discharge planning has been documented to be challenging, and is affected by issues such as role confusion and competing priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1054773812436373">Nosbusch, Weiss, &amp; Bobay, 2010</xref>). Ultimately, for discharge planning to be successful, patients need to be referred to services that are of the right intensity and duration. Research studies indicate that referrals to appropriate services at the time of hospital discharge often does not happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773812436373">Bowles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773812436373">Bowles, Naylor, &amp; Foust, 2002</xref>). In particular, hospital staff do not consistently refer high-risk patients for home health care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773812436373">Bowles et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773812436373">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Aside from referral problems, changes in health policy and reimbursement also influence the willingness of agencies to accept patients. Following the introduction of the prospective payment system for home health care, patients in both urban and rural areas received 20% fewer services including professional nursing, therapy, social work, and aide services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1054773812436373">Sutton, 2005</xref>). Recently, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812436373">MedPAC, 2011</xref>) reported both the number of home health care agencies and service use has rebounded to higher than 1997 levels. Nonetheless, the number of visits per user decreased from 72.6 visits per user in 1997 to 39.4 visits per user in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812436373">MedPAC, 2011</xref>). In home health care there are financial incentives that make it more attractive for agencies to accept patients who require rehabilitative services over patients who are medically complex (e.g., require wound care, or have functional limitations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812436373">MedPAC, 2011</xref>). Similarly, skilled nursing facilities (SNF) also have a financial incentive to admit patients who require higher levels of rehabilitative therapy, rather than those with medically complex needs (e.g., wound care, respiratory care, dialysis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812436373">MedPAC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There are some known urban and rural differences in patient admission practices. Nursing homes that accept greater numbers of medically complex patients are disproportionately located in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812436373">MedPAC, 2011</xref>). Nursing homes in rural areas are more likely to admit patients who have problem behaviors associated with cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812436373">Bolin, Phillips, &amp; Haws, 2006</xref>). In addition, the issue of health care supply may be a critical one in rural areas. In general, rural health care is problematic because there is a documented lack of rural health care providers including physicians, nurses, advance practice nurses, physical therapists, and pharmacists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773812436373">MacDowell, Glasser, Fitts, Nielsen, &amp; Hunsaker, 2010</xref>). Rural residents often must travel to urban centers to receive needed care and services. In 2003, 32% of rural residents were hospitalized in urban hospitals because they needed extensive medical resources, required services such as surgery, or had mental health care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773812436373">Hall, Owings, &amp; Shinogle, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Service availability, particularly in rural areas, is further complicated by transportation difficulties. It is more difficult for health care providers to reach rural patients due to distance and travel time but it is also hard for patients to reach health care providers. In fact, 3.6 million Americans did not receive needed medical care because of lack of transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773812436373">Wallace, Hughes-Cromwick, Mull, &amp; Khasnabis, 2005</xref>). Similar to urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773812436373">Wallace et al., 2005</xref>), drivers who live in rural areas have more health care visits for chronic care and regular checkups than people without a driver’s license (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812436373">Arcury, Preisser, Gesler, &amp; Powers, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenges associated with finding health care for patients after hospital discharge are significant. In all settings, formal sources of postacute care cannot function without the informal but essential family support, including nuclear and extended family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812436373">Dellasega &amp; Fisher, 2001</xref>). Critical gaps in individual patient care develop when referrals are not made, services are not readily available, or changes in informal sources of care require alterations in the discharge plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1054773812436373">Magilvy &amp; Congdon, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Design and Questions</title>
<p>This descriptive study used a cross-sectional web-based survey targeted to health care professionals in Missouri involved in discharge planning for hospitalized older adults. The specific aims of the study were to identify (a) the type and extent of problems encountered when discharging hospitalized older adults, (b) rural and urban differences in discharging hospitalized older adults, and (c) differences in problems encountered by various professional groups involved in the discharge of older adults.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1054773812436373">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>After obtaining institutional review board approval, initial survey respondents were identified from lists of self-identified case managers, administrative personnel, directors of nursing from the state hospital association, and physicians from the state chapter of American College of Physicians (ACP). A snowball sampling method was used; those who were originally contacted were asked to complete the survey and prompted to send it to others who were also knowledgeable about problems encountered in discharge planning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1054773812436373">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>In an attempt to learn more about problems encountered during discharge planning, a survey instrument was developed by the investigators. The development of the survey questions were informed by data obtained from five focus groups convened with a total of 41 participants from three Mid-Missouri hospitals, including a 240-bed teaching hospital, a 350-bed private tertiary care hospital, and a 155-bed community hospital. Participants were from a variety of disciplines knowledgeable about discharge planning including nurses, social workers, care coordinators, case managers, and physicians. Questions were kept intentionally broad to capture a wide range of experiences. Participants were first asked to describe a recent discharge that went well. The group was then asked to describe a discharge that was problematic. Finally, participants were asked about typical problems encountered when discharging hospitalized patients and actions taken to overcome those problems. IRB approval was obtained prior to conducting the focus groups. Tape recorders were used to capture focus group discussion and the tapes were transcribed through the use of a transcription service. The transcripts were read by three investigators who identified major issues or problems identified by participants. These issues or problems were then categorized according to discharge setting, for example, nursing home, residential care, home health care care, and type of problem, for example, medications, diagnosis, behavior, and informal caregiver among others. From these categories questions were designed using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436373">Dillman (2000)</xref> Survey Model as a guide. The survey design provided a mechanism to learn about the extent that problems identified by the focus group existed in hospitals throughout the state.</p>
<p>Content validity of the survey was established by sending a draft of it through email communication to the contact person of each hospital involved in the focus groups, who then distributed the survey to those who attended the focus groups from that hospital. The former participants were (a) asked to read the survey questions to identify if the questions accurately reflected the major challenges discussed in the focus groups, and (b) comment on clarity and readability of questions. If questions were unclear, former participants suggested revisions. Suggestions were then reviewed by the three investigators and changes were made to the original wording. The final survey was once again read by former participants to assess survey accuracy and readability. Next the survey was given to physicians, social workers, and nurses knowledgeable of hospital discharge planning for their input. Prior to release of the survey, a graduate student in nursing who had not been involved in the development process reviewed the survey for clarity before placing the survey into an electronic format.</p>
<p>The final survey had a total of 74 questions about problems encountered in the discharges of hospitalized patients to nursing homes, residential care, and home health care. Definitions for these settings were provided in the survey. The largest set of questions was in regard to skilled nursing care in nursing homes and included complexities associated with accessing care for patients who required ventilators, hemodialysis, wound vacuums, or who had diagnoses such as diabetes or mental illness among others. There were similar survey questions specific to residential care facilities and home health care. Participants were asked to rate how often they had difficulty finding services for patients in each setting. Responses ranged from 1 to 5 and were anchored by percentages of time the problem occurs, specifically a score of 1 = <italic>problem happened very often</italic> (76%-100% of the time); 2, = <italic>happened often</italic> (51%-75% of the time); 3 = <italic>somewhat often</italic> (26%-50% of the time); 4 = <italic>not often</italic> (1%-25% of the time); and 5 = <italic>the problem never occurred</italic> (0% of the time). An example of a question is the following: When older adult patients have one or more of the following medical conditions or needs, how often does your hospital have difficulty finding a skilled nursing bed? There are 17 problem conditions (e.g., ventilators, wound vacuums, hemodialysis) that participants were asked to respond to using the response range previously described. A copy of the instrument is available through the investigators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1054773812436373">
<title>Procedure for Data Collection</title>
<p>An electronic Internet survey platform was used for distribution to potential study participants. The investigators sent emails requesting participation directly to the state Hospital Association members who were directors of nursing, nursing administrators, or case managers. These initial contacts were then asked to complete the survey if they were familiar with hospital discharge planning and then to forward the survey to colleagues involved in discharge planning. Only those who responded to the original email request could access the primary electronic link; therefore, participants who received a forwarded request were directed to the primary investigators’ web page to access the survey. Members of the state Chapter of American Colleges of Physicians were recruited in two ways. The web page link was sent through a newsletter and some physicians were contacted through a direct e-mail message.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1054773812436373">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analysis was done using the software Statistical Analysis Software Version 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1054773812436373">SAS, 2009</xref>). Analysis for the study was specific to each study aim. The first study, Aim (1), <italic>to identify the type and extent of problems encountered when discharging hospitalized older adults</italic>, required participants to quantify how often specific medical conditions or care needs influenced the difficulty in finding posthospital services for patients. Summary statistics were calculated for each question and problem condition.</p>
<p>Aim (2) <italic>identified rural and urban differences in discharging hospitalized older adults</italic> and was addressed in two different ways. First, respondents were asked to identify the location of the hospital where they worked by giving the zip code of the hospital. The zip code was compared with the USDA 2005 Rural-Urban Continuum codes (2008) that classifies counties using a 9-category continuum of urban to rural. These 9 categories were then collapsed into 4 categories because in some of the more rural counties there were as few as three responses. Code 1 remained unchanged; codes 2 and 3 were collapsed; codes 4, 5, and 6 were collapsed, and codes 7, 8, and 9 were collapsed. The resulting 4 codes were considered ordinal in nature. Spearman Rank correlations were calculated to identify a relationship between urban–rural classification and question responses. Because there were 74 questions, it was necessary to make adjustments for multiple tests using the false discovery rate (FDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773812436373">Benjamin &amp; Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Items were considered significant at an FDR adjusted level of 0.05.</p>
<p>Aim (3) <italic>identified differences in problems encountered by various professional groups in the discharge of older adults</italic>. Six categories of professional groups (nurse, physician, social worker, case manager, administrator, and physical or occupational therapist) were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test to identify if their survey responses differed. Once again adjustments for multiple tests were done using the FDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773812436373">Benjamin &amp; Hochberg, 1995</xref>) at a significance level of 0.05.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>There were a total of 368 respondents to the survey. The sample included health care professionals who were nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 63, 17%), social workers (<italic>n</italic> = 79, 21%), case managers (<italic>n</italic> = 61, 17%), physicians (<italic>n</italic> = 84, 23%), managers/administrators (<italic>n</italic> = 66, 18%), and physical or occupational therapist (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 0.27%). Participants were asked to identify licensure, and nearly half (<italic>n</italic> = 179, 49.5%) held a nursing license. Respondents were from 50 of the 115 Missouri counties and all major regions of the state were represented. Nearly 40% of respondents worked in one of two large metropolitan areas (≥1,000,000 people), 35% of respondents worked in cities with population densities of &lt; 250, 000 to 999,000.

<title>Problems With Finding Placement or Services</title>
<p>Survey respondents were asked to quantify how often specific problem conditions or care needs influenced the difficulty in finding posthospital services for patients requiring a skilled nursing facility bed, residential care, or home health care services. For those patients for whom a skilled nursing bed was sought, hospital health care professionals identified that ventilator care was very often difficult to find (median score 1). They also reported often having problems finding beds for patients who had tracheostomies, required hemodialysis, infections requiring isolation, chemotherapy, mental illness, and morbid obesity (median score 2). For patients who required a residential care bed, conditions for which it was problematic to find placements included hemodialysis, infection requiring isolation, and mental illness (median score 2). Hospital respondents reported that for home health care it was a problem to find ventilator care for patients (median score 2). Discharges were problematic if there was not an available caregiver in the home (median score 2). Finally, it was reported as difficult to obtain medications (a) costing more than US$51, (b) enoxaparin (Lovenox), or (c) expensive intravenous medications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1054773812436373">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Urban–Rural Differences</title>
<p>Differences between urban and rural hospitals were found in the severity of problems encountered when discharging patients. Professionals who worked in urban hospitals had more difficulty than those who worked in rural hospitals in finding skilled nursing beds for patients who had dementia (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), pressure ulcers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), history of falls (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), lack of informal caregiver support (<italic>p</italic> = .023), mental illness (<italic>p</italic> = .014), or required hemodialysis (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), radiation therapy (<italic>p</italic> = .025), wound vacuums (<italic>p</italic> = .015), or dressing changes (<italic>p</italic> = .023). Personnel in urban hospitals also reported more problems finding residential care beds for patients who required hemodialysis (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), had dementia (<italic>p</italic> = .004), mental retardation/developmental disabilities (<italic>p</italic> = .015), mental illness (<italic>p</italic> = 0.022), or with infection requiring isolation (<italic>p</italic> = .016). Personnel in urban setting also reported more problems obtaining weekend admissions to home health care (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Urban hospitals had more problems associated with delays of hospital discharge greater than 24 hr to skilled nursing beds (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and residential care facility beds (<italic>p</italic> = .003). Two variables transportation (<italic>p</italic> = .053) and morbid obesity (<italic>p</italic> = .054) were not significantly different between urban and rural areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1054773812436373">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Differences Between Health Care Professionals</title>
<p>In general there were few differences in how health care professionals responded to questions. Of note were responses to the questions regarding problems with discharging patients to skilled nursing facilities (<italic>p</italic> = .001) or home health care services over the weekend (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). These situations were reported as more problematic by case managers and administrators than nurses (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), physicians (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), therapists (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), or social workers (<italic>p</italic> = .001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings from this study support that it continues to be challenging to locate postacute care for hospitalized older patients with health care conditions or treatments that are complex, difficult to manage, or costly. Personnel in urban hospitals reported more difficulty locating postacute services, which in turn led to delays in hospital discharge. We expected that personnel in rural hospitals would report more problems finding postacute care because of fewer providers and long travel distances to access services. Problems or conditions that were particularly troublesome included the need for mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, complex wound care, cancer treatments, or mental illness. Unfortunately, the survey did not offer insight into why personnel in urban hospitals had more difficulty finding postacute care. The investigators speculated that urban facilities may have more potential admissions and may choose not to accept patients requiring high-cost treatments such as ventilators, hemodialysis, cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or complex mental health care needs. It is possible that urban hospitals are having difficulty discharging back to rural settings and the survey did not identify that issue. Many rural hospitals have skilled nursing care available in their hospital (in the United States this is known as a swing bed), thus a transfer is not required. Another explanation may be that rural communities have stronger social connections with members of their community, meaning that rural facilities or agencies are more willing to care for and accommodate the needs of their own community members. Future research is needed to explicate the issue.</p>
<p>Finding postacute care services for patients who require prolonged acute mechanical ventilation is a particularly pernicious problem in the United States. The number of people requiring prolonged acute mechanical ventilation is projected to increase, which in turn will lead to increased intensive care days, hospital days, and a need for more postacute care settings capable of caring for this type of patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1054773812436373">Zillerberg, &amp; Shorr, 2008</xref>). Providing care for mechanically ventilated patients requires staff, namely, registered nurses and respiratory therapists, who can manage the technology. In U.S. nursing homes and residential care settings, the majority of care is provided by licensed practical nurses (LPNs), or nurse assistants. A recent study noted that the registered nurses in nursing homes are being replaced by LPNs, leading to a reduction in skill mix (Seblega et al., 2009). Many nursing homes simply do not have staff with the necessary skills and experience to care for patients requiring prolonged acute mechanical ventilation. Moreover, the current health care system does not adequately reimburse for patients who need highly intense postacute services such as ventilators, hemodialysis, wound vacuums for complex wounds, and other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1054773812436373">Hackbarth, 2010</xref>). Perhaps the research challenge of the future for patients who need prolonged mechanical ventilation is to continue to find less invasive ways to safely support pulmonary function in low-technology environments.</p>
<p>Survey respondents also noted that hemodialysis patients were more difficult to place in skilled nursing beds and residential care. Similar to other chronic health care conditions in the United States, the number of patients above the age of 80 requiring hemodialysis treatment has increased by 57% from the years 1996 to 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773812436373">Kurella, Covinsky, Collins, &amp; Chertow, 2007</xref>). These patients are at risk for loss of physical functioning, which makes their care challenging and expensive. In particular, transportation costs, which facilities must pay for, increase for residents who are unable to be transported by wheelchair or who must travel distances to a dialysis center. Furthermore, hemodialysis patients require physicians, registered nurses, and dietitians to actively assess and manage problems related to chronic renal failure and hemodialysis. Staff must communicate with the dialysis center to develop and refine treatment plans including diet, medications, and activity orders. The added complexity and costs associated with the care of dialysis patients makes finding posthospital placements in nursing homes or residential care facilities particularly challenging.</p>
<p>There are difficulties in securing posthospital care for older adults with mental illness who also have comorbid medical conditions. This study did not offer the granularity needed to identify what sort of mental illnesses were a problem, or to identify if the issue was potentially related to problem behavior and not diagnosis. Currently, in the United States there are more residents with mental illness, primarily depression, than residents with dementia who live in nursing homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1054773812436373">Fullerton, McQuire, Feng, &amp; Mor, 2009</xref>). Thus it may well be the difficulty lies in finding a discharge location for those with psychosis, who may be deemed more of a danger to older adults living in nursing homes. It is essential that people with serious mental illness who need care and treatment for physical problems have an option of admission to nursing homes, or residential care facilities. The present study did not offer enough information about specific mental health diagnoses to identify if any type of diagnosis is more problematic than another. Given the problems with finding facilities willing to provide care to patients with mental illness and comorbid medical conditions, it may be useful to do further study to identify why facilities are reluctant to admit these patients and to identify successful strategies to manage postacute care.</p>
<p>Very little is known about how skilled nursing and residential care facilities manage patients who require complex treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This study identified that hospitals are challenged to find postdischarge care for patients who require chemotherapy or radiation therapy; however, it cannot be determined from the survey why hospitals had this difficulty. It seems reasonable to assume that these types of patients had complex care needs that were greater than what the nursing home or residential care facility could meet. That being said it must be acknowledged that in general nursing home residents are not often treated for cancer. One in 10 nursing home residents have cancer, yet only 3.9% undergo chemotherapy and 4.5% have radiation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773812436373">Johnson, Teno, Boubonniere, &amp; Mor, 2005</xref>). Of those nursing home residents who are treated, more than 30% are dependent in all activities of daily living, 30% received intravenous therapy, and nearly 51% had persistent and severe pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773812436373">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). As with other conditions, it is anticipated that the demand for these therapies will increase as the population ages, and hospitals may need to more closely align with postacute care settings to offer support and education for nursing home staff.</p>
<p>Respondents reported difficulty finding beds and services for patients who were morbidly obese. The increase in obesity in the United States is well documented. Older adults aged 60 to 69 have an obesity prevalence of nearly 31%, and for those aged 70 or greater the prevalence is nearly 21% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773812436373">Centers for Disease Control, 2010</xref>). Recent evidence identifies that obese nursing home residents had higher odd ratios (OR range, 1.18-1.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) of needing two or more people to assist them with activities of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812436373">Felix, 2008</xref>). Other investigators identified that nursing homes may not have the necessary equipment to safely manage the care that obese residents require (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773812436373">Lapane &amp; Resnik, 2005</xref>). The difference between urban and rural setting only approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = .054) for this issue, which suggests that finding posthospital care and services for morbidly obese patients is a problem regardless of urban or rural setting. It is interesting to note that the health care professionals in this study had varying perceptions of how difficult it is to find posthospital care for morbidly obese patients. Case managers reported more problems than nurses or social workers in finding discharge destinations and services. This finding may be a result of the fact that social workers are educated about community resources, more so than nurses or case managers.</p>
<p>Finally it should be noted that problems with finding services for patients who required home health care were quite different than the problems encountered for patients who required nursing home or residential care. There were no urban and rural differences in home health care as there was with institutional care. Other than ventilator and tracheostomy care, challenges to finding home health care centered on problems with having sufficient family caregiving resources, or the ability of the patient to afford to pay for medications and treatments. In particular, the finding about medication affordability is clinically significant. In a recent study about cost-related medication nonadherence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1054773812436373">Madden et al. (2011)</xref> noted that while implementation of Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage was intended to reduce cost-related medication nonadherence for Medicare beneficiaries, there has been no significant decrease in cost-related medication adherence (ratio of ORs, 1.00; 95% CI, [0.82, 1.21]; <italic>p</italic> = .97) for those Medicare recipients who rated their health fair to poor. The findings from our study are consistent with the national picture that the ability to afford medications is a problem for older and disabled Americans.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are limitations to this study. One limitation is that the survey occurred in one Midwestern state in the United States. All regions of the state and both urban and rural settings were represented, but there was a greater response rate from urban hospitals. This study focused on the perspective of hospital providers, not patients, caregivers, or providers working in postacute care settings. The study also asked general questions about hospital discharges, rather than a focus on issues related to specific known discharges. Because a snowball sampling technique was used, it was impossible to control who responded to the survey and to identify how much participants personally engaged in discharge planning activities. Finally, the need to collapse the urban rural continuum codes into fewer categories for analysis may have resulted in less clear distinctions of urban and rural areas that might be obtained by using other methods.</p>

<sec id="section15-1054773812436373" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study punctuates the problem of finding postacute care for older adult patients who have highly complex or expensive health care needs. Our study found more problems in urban than rural areas. Clearly it is necessary to address some of the financial burdens that postacute care providers face when they accept patients who have expensive complex conditions and treatments. Perhaps equally important is the need to develop a way to build the critical skills that nursing home and residential care staff need to care for these complex patients. As hospitals seek to aggressively reduce avoidable readmissions, they may need to build relationships with providers, which allow for ongoing training and support of postacute care staff so they can successfully manage complex, or highly technical care. Reflecting on the study results, it is documented in the professional literature that rural settings have a stronger sense of community and a desire to care for their own community members that is missing from larger urban centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1054773812436373">Galambos, 2005</xref>). But it is also possible that urban hospitals are having difficulty discharging back to rural settings and the survey did not identify that issue. It is important that patients who are discharged from the hospital with complex health care conditions find posthospital services that are close to their homes and families. In the immediate future, U.S. hospitals will have to manage discharges and transitions to avoid significant financial penalties for avoidable hospital readmissions. The U.S. health care system will continue to face challenges as the population ages and the need for ongoing care and complex management of health care conditions increases.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Intestinal and multivisceral transplantation has evolved from an experimental procedure to the treatment of choice for patients with irreversible intestinal failure and serious complications related to long-term parenteral nutrition. Increased numbers of transplant recipients and improved survival rates have led to an increased prevalence of this patient population in intensive care units. Management of intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients is uniquely challenging because of complications arising from the high incidence of transplant rejection and its treatment. Long-term comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney failure, and neurological sequelae, also develop in this patient population as survival improves. This article is intended for intensivists who provide care to critically ill recipients of intestinal and multivisceral transplants. As perioperative care of intestinal/multivisceral transplant recipients has been described elsewhere, this review focuses on common nonsurgical complications with which one should be familiar in order to provide optimal care. The article is both a review of the current literature on multivisceral and isolated intestinal transplantation as well as a reflection of our own experience at the University of Miami.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The medical care of multiple organ transplant recipients requires management of insufficiency of every organ system in an era when single-organ specialization is the norm. The complexity of such care requires a multidisciplinary approach with coordination by an intensivist in collaboration with the transplant surgeon, gastroenterologist, and other specialists. The care of multivisceral transplants, a term applied to the en bloc transplantation of liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine, and sometimes spleen, is fortunately quite similar to the care of isolated intestinal transplant recipients. Surgical techniques, immediate postoperative care, and acute complications of multivisceral, liver, and intestinal transplants are described elsewhere; and therefore will not be covered here.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066611432425">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885066611432425">Figure 1</xref>
gives an overview of the types of grafts used in intestinal transplantation. This article focuses on nonsurgical and long-term complications common to intestinal/multivisceral transplant recipients with which the intensivist should be familiar in order to provide optimal care. In a 10-year review of our single-center experience of pediatric abdominal organ transplantation, intestinal/multivisceral transplant recipients were 3 times more likely to be readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) than liver transplant recipients and 7 times more likely than kidney transplant recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066611432425">2</xref></sup> The intestinal/multivisceral transplant recipients were younger than other organ recipients and had a greater ICU mortality. Overall, our data showed that 19% of discharged intestinal/multivisceral transplant patients were readmitted to the ICU at least once within the first year post transplant with sepsis, rejection, or respiratory failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066611432425">2</xref></sup>

<p>Intestinal/multivisceral transplant recipients are at risk for complications unrelated to their transplant but related to their primary disease. In our center, the most common indication for pediatric intestinal transplant is gastroschisis (27%) followed by necrotizing enterocolitis (20%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611432425">3</xref></sup> Because of a history of prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, and poor nutrition, pediatric patients with intestinal failure have many comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease, failure to thrive, poor vascular access, and limited abdominal capacity. In adult transplantation, mesenteric thrombosis is a common primary diagnosis and a coexisting hypercoaguable state may lead to additional complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066611432425">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611432425">5</xref></sup> Following transplantation, these preexisting conditions are now compounded by immunosuppression and a complex medication regimen. In the ICU, optimal care is facilitated by daily rounds with multiple disciplines (surgery, gastroenterology, nursing, pharmacy, and social work) and open communication between the intensivist and the transplant specialist. When these patients present to ICUs distant from the home transplant center, early communication is essential and transfer after stabilization may be necessary.</p>

<title>Immune System</title>

<title>Immunosuppression Protocols</title>
<p>The first attempts at intestinal transplantation over two decades ago failed due to acute rejection and its common sequela, bacterial infection. With the introduction of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in 1990, the short-term survival of intestinal transplant recipients has substantially improved, but long-term patient survival remains challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066611432425">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611432425">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066611432425">7</xref></sup> Intestinal and multivisceral transplants differ from other solid organ transplants because of the complex interaction between the intestinal allograft and the native immune system including the gut-associated lymphoid tissue of the bowel mucosa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611432425">6</xref></sup> There is evidence that enterocytes have the capacity to function as antigen presenting cells resulting in stimulation of donor lymphocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066611432425">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066611432425"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066611432425">10</xref></sup> As a consequence, these patients need greater immunosuppression than other solid organ recipients and experience higher rates of acute and chronic rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611432425">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066611432425">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611432425">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066611432425">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The implementation of an efficient induction therapy reduces the risk of rejection. Induction therapy varies by center but typically consists of antilymphocyte preparations such as rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG; Thymoglobulin, Genzyme, Cambridge, Massachusetts), alemtuzumab (Campath-1H, Berlex Laboratories, Montville, New Jersey), or daclizumab (Zenapax, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, New Jersey).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066611432425">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611432425">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066611432425">7</xref></sup> However, the use of Campath-1H in pediatric transplant recipients was associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality due to infection in children younger than 4 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066611432425">11</xref></sup> Maintenance immunosuppression consists of the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf, Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, Illinois) in conjunction with methylprednisolone. The initial tacrolimus target whole blood concentration is a 12-hour trough concentration of 15 to 20 ng/mL for the first 3 months in most centers. Subsequently, concentrations are kept slightly lower, 8 to 12 ng/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611432425">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066611432425">4</xref></sup> At our center, maintenance steroids are reduced 6 to 9 months after transplantation, while others wean patients from corticosteroids 2 to 4 weeks after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066611432425">4</xref></sup> Whether or not specific induction therapies will permit reduction in long-term immunosuppression in intestinal and multivisceral transplants remains to be seen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0885066611432425">
<title>Acute Cellular Rejection</title>
<p>Acute cellular rejection (ACR) occurs in approximately 60% of children after intestinal transplantation, generally within the first 3 months post transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066611432425">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066611432425">13</xref></sup> In multivisceral transplantation, the most common site of ACR is the intestine, while other organs appear to be spared. The tacrolimus level often appears to be paradoxically elevated at the time of presentation with rejection, secondary to altered metabolism by the impaired enterocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066611432425">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066611432425">15</xref></sup> ACR is characterized by fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and/or distension and is often associated with positive blood cultures due to bacterial translocation of enteric organisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066611432425">16</xref></sup> For this reason, some authors recommend initiation of prophylactic antibacterial and antiviral therapy during any episode of intestinal allograft rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611432425">6</xref></sup> The systemic inflammatory response that accompanies rejection can mimic sepsis with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypotension and requires careful monitoring and aggressive resuscitation.</p>
<p>Early detection of rejection is crucial as ACR remains the greatest risk factor for graft failure; particularly, if there is a severe rejection episode or if rejection is not resolved within 21 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611432425">3</xref></sup> Surveillance endoscopic biopsies and zoom video endoscopy are currently performed biweekly during the first month, weekly during the next 2 months, then monthly afterward. Additional endoscopies are frequently required when fever, diarrhea, or bacteremia occur. During suspected or proven episodes of rejection, endoscopies are performed as often as every other day until symptoms and the histopathological features resolve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066611432425">12</xref></sup> Intestinal rejection can be localized; therefore, multiple biopsies must be obtained from several locations. Since histopathologic changes are a delayed manifestation of rejection and may occur in isolated areas, potential biomarkers for better and earlier detection of rejection such as plasma citrulline and fetal calprotectin are under investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066611432425">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066611432425"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066611432425"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885066611432425"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066611432425"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066611432425"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066611432425"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066611432425">23</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The endoscopic findings of ACR include blunted villi, edematous and friable mucosa, ulcers, and mucosal exfoliation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066611432425">24</xref></sup> Histopathologically, acute allograft rejection is graded mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), or severe (grade 3) based on a combination of crypt injury, mucosal infiltration primarily by mononuclear cells, and increased crypt cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885066611432425">Figure 2</xref>
).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885066611432425">25</xref></sup> Exfoliative severe rejection is defined by denudation of the intestinal epithelium and is associated with high rates of mortality and graft loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885066611432425">26</xref></sup>

<p>Acute cellular rejection is treated by modulation of immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885066611432425">Table 1</xref>
). Mild acute rejection is treated with pulsed steroids (methylprednisolone 15-30 mg/kg), followed by a weaning cycle along with an increase in targeted tacrolimus concentration to early posttransplantation values. Steroid-resistant episodes as well as moderate and severe rejection are generally treated with Muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3) or Thymoglobulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066611432425">12</xref></sup> Treatment can vary from a single dose to 14 days of therapy depending on severity and response.</p>

<title>Humoral Rejection</title>
<p>Humoral rejection or antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) can result from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I or II donor antigens, non-HLA antibodies to blood group antigens, and endothelial antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885066611432425">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885066611432425">28</xref></sup> Although humoral rejection is well described in kidney and heart transplantation, little is known about its occurrence in intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients. Kato and colleagues showed HLA antibodies present in 5 of 28 patients post intestinal/multivisceral transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885066611432425">29</xref></sup> Cytotoxic crossmatch was negative in all patients at the time of transplant. Three of the 5 patients had strongly positive plasma reactive antibody (PRA) titer; all 3 had temporally associated significant episodes of acute rejection; whereas only 1 of the 25 patients without a strongly positive PRA titer had a rejection episode around the time of sampling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885066611432425">29</xref></sup> Another small study in intestinal transplant recipients found a correlation between humoral sensitization and intestinal mucosal vascular changes, possibly indicative of an acute vascular rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885066611432425">30</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Treatment options for AMR are limited. The use of plasmapheresis combined with intensified immunosuppression has shown some success in single-organ transplant recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885066611432425">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885066611432425">32</xref></sup> High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has also been associated with decreased antibody titers and successful reversal of humoral rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885066611432425">27</xref></sup> While plasmapheresis and IVIG reduce circulating antibodies, Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20 present on B-lymphocytes, has been used to stop antibody production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885066611432425">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885066611432425">34</xref></sup> Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, causes apoptosis in plasma cells, thereby decreasing alloantibody production. It has been found to be useful in treating AMR in kidney transplant recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885066611432425">35</xref></sup> A recent case report showed successful reversal using bortezomib of refractory rejection in a patient following multivisceral transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885066611432425">36</xref></sup>

<sec id="section6-0885066611432425">
<title>Chronic Rejection</title>
<p>Chronic rejection is one of the most common causes of intestinal graft loss after the second posttransplant year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611432425">3</xref></sup> In a recent retrospective study, chronic rejection was diagnosed in approximately 20% of isolated intestinal transplants and 5% of multivisceral transplants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066611432425">11</xref></sup> Patients typically present with abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and weight loss. In general, it is still most likely underdiagnosed due to limitations in analysis and lack of specific histologic markers and pathologic features. Major features are nonspecific and include progressive obliterative arteriopathy, apoptosis, mural fibrosis, and perivascular inflammation. In multivisceral transplants, the pancreas might be the organ most susceptible to chronic rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885066611432425">37</xref></sup> Currently, retransplantation is the only definitive treatment for chronic rejection with graft failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885066611432425">38</xref></sup>

<title>Graft Versus Host Disease</title>
<p>Graft versus host disease (GvHD), defined as a reaction of donor immunocompetent cells against host tissue, is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Typically inflammatory cytokines and donor-derived lymphocytes damage skin, native liver, and native intestine. In intestinal/multivisceral organ transplantation, however, the skin is often the only involved organ, although pulmonary GvHD is reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885066611432425">39</xref></sup> The diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, detection of mixed chimerism with circulating donor lymphocytes, and histopathology. Graft versus host disease occurs in 4% to 10% of intestinal transplant recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611432425">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611432425">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885066611432425">39</xref></sup> In a retrospective analysis of 46 children undergoing intestinal/multivisceral transplantation, 5 patients developed GvHD at a median time of 47 days after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885066611432425">39</xref></sup> All of the patients had cutaneous symptoms with a maculopapular generalized rash, and 2 patients had gastrointestinal involvement in the form of diarrhea. In addition, 3 patients developed respiratory symptoms and 4 patients had severe hematologic abnormalities (pancytopenia, T-cell lymphoma, myeloid dysplasia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia). Three of the 5 patients with GvHD died a few months after diagnosis. In another study of 123 children, 6 developed confirmed GvHD (0.5 ± 0.1 cases per 100 patient months of follow-up), and 4 of these 6 died.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611432425">3</xref></sup>

The majority of clinically important infections occur within the first 6 months posttransplant and the risk periods can be divided into 3 intervals: early (0-30 days after transplantation); intermediate (30-180 days after transplantation); and late (more than 180 days posttransplantation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885066611432425">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885066611432425"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885066611432425"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885066611432425">51</xref></sup> Infections in the early period are typically nosocomial or donor derived.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885066611432425">48</xref></sup> As with all instrumented surgical patients, the risk of postoperative infections correlates with the duration of intravascular catheter usage, mechanical ventilation, and the presence of abnormal fluid collections. In transplant recipients, the graft is a common source of infection and warrants evaluation in the presence of unexplained fever and systemic inflammatory response. Since effective therapy is guided by antimicrobial susceptibility data, it is essential to perform assays and microbiologic analysis of aspirates or biopsy specimens.</p>
<p>In the intermediate period, viral pathogens are the principle culprits, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV), epstein-barr virus (EBV), and other human herpes viruses, which in turn have the ability to modulate the immune system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885066611432425">47</xref></sup> Fortunately, the use of antiviral prophylactic strategies has made herpes virus infections uncommon.

<p>Respiratory failure in intestinal/multivisceral transplant recipients should be managed as it is in other critically ill populations with a few caveats. The use of noninvasive ventilation should be limited to a select population. Disrupted innervation of the transplanted stomach and/or proximal intestine impairs gastrointestinal motility and increases the risk of aspiration. In addition, a small abdominal compartment may be compromised by intra-abdominal hypertension with even a small increase in intestinal air. Once intubated, sedation can be difficult in this population and higher doses of sedatives are required either because of upregulated hepatic enzymes or a high liver mass to body weight ratio. Typically, when plateau airway pressures are greater than 30 to 35 cmH<sub>2</sub>O we have implemented high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. This requires pharmacologic paralysis in a population with many risk factors for prolonged paralysis and critical illness polyneurophathy, so drug holidays and or daily monitoring of train-of-four are recommended.</p>

<title>Acute Kidney Injury</title>
<p>Recipients of intestinal/multivisceral transplants have multiple risk factors for development of acute or chronic kidney failure, both pre- and posttransplant.

In the face of low renal reserve, whole blood tacrolimus concentrations over 20 ng/mL are associated with elevated serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and oliguria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0885066611432425">79</xref></sup> Various vasoregulatory molecules, including endothelin and adenosine, are involved in calcineurin inhibitor–related renal artery vasoconstriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0885066611432425">79</xref></sup> Hence, acute tacrolimus toxicity frequently does not respond to diuretic therapy.

<p>In transplant recipients, presence of donor lymphocytes and a deregulated immune system can lead to antibody-mediated destruction of hematologic cell lines. Alloantibody-mediated hemolytic anemia usually occurs in the first weeks after solid organ transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0885066611432425">103</xref></sup> This is caused by donor lymphocytes, in what is called the passenger lymphocyte syndrome whereby the concurrently transplanted B-cells produce antibodies that react against recipient red blood cell antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0885066611432425">103</xref></sup> Donor antibody-induced hemolysis in ABO-mismatched solid organ transplantation is usually mild and self-limiting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0885066611432425">104</xref></sup> whereas alloimmune hemolytic anemia due to antibodies with anti-D (Rhesus) specificity can be severe needing multiple transfusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0885066611432425">103</xref></sup> Passenger lymphocyte syndrome can also affect the platelet count.

<p>Lacaille and coworkers described 6 children who developed severe antibody-mediated anemia or thrombocytopenia while treated with tacrolimus after liver or small bowel transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0885066611432425">106</xref></sup> All patients had positive antiplatelet antibodies or Coombs-positive anemia.

<title>Epstein-Barr Virus and PTLD</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that can infect several cell lines including lymphocytes and has been associated with different malignancies including PTLD, a group of heterogenous lymphoproliferative diseases arising in the pharmacologically immunosuppressed population after organ transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0885066611432425">110</xref></sup> The incidence of PTLD is in the range of 5% to 10% for pediatric organ recipients and is higher in patients with intestinal and multivisceral grafts compared to other solid organ graft recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885066611432425">111</xref></sup> Generally, the risk of PTLD corresponds to the duration and intensity of the immunosuppressive therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0885066611432425">112</xref></sup> Specifically, the use of anti-T-cell antibodies exposes patients to a higher risk than the sole immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0885066611432425">113</xref></sup> Seronegativity EBV status at time of transplant is a risk factor for PTLD, hence children are at increased risk compared to adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0885066611432425">114</xref></sup> Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders can occur at anytime with the highest incidence occuring in the first year after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0885066611432425">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0885066611432425">115</xref></sup> A high index of suspicion is needed to detect PTLD since the clinical presentation is often nonspecific including symptoms of fever, fatigue, and weight loss. The availability of quantitative PCR improves detection and serial monitoring of EBV viral load in peripheral blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0885066611432425">116</xref></sup> Since the rise of EBV viral loads often precedes the development of PTLD, transplant recipients at high risk of PTLD or under PTLD therapy routinely undergo EBV DNA PCR monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0885066611432425">117</xref></sup> Total body imaging studies with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) scan are necessary for staging of PTLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0885066611432425">118</xref></sup> Biopsy of the accessible nodal tissues is essential, since histopathologic examination remains the gold standard for diagnosing PTLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0885066611432425">118</xref></sup> Gastrointestinal tissue sampling maybe useful in the absence of a biopsy from lymph nodes, but a negative result does not rule out the disease.</p>
<p>The immediate treatment of PTLD is a reduction in immunosuppression whenever feasible. Even temporary discontinuation of all immunosuppression with close monitoring for rejection does not lead to an increased loss of graft function in liver transplant recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0885066611432425">119</xref></sup>; however, this aggressive approach is avoided with bowel and multivisceral transplant due to the risk of rejection.

For patients with CD20+ PTLD who do not respond to immunotherapy reduction, rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), an anti-CD 20 antibody provides an effective treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0885066611432425">123</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0885066611432425"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0885066611432425">125</xref></sup> Rituxan is also being used in conjunction with chemotherapy for refractory PTLD.

<title>Neurological Complications</title>
<p>Pediatric intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients often have significant delay in cognitive and motor function due to prematurity, malnutrition, and severe illness in early childhood. Intraoperatively and posttransplant, they are exposed to multiple drugs with neurotoxic potential, for example anesthetics, tacrolimus, and corticosteroids. As a consequence, many pediatric patients display developmental delay in the first 6 months posttransplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0885066611432425">129</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0885066611432425">130</xref></sup> Only one adult study examined the incidence and spectrum of neurologic complications specifically after intestinal and multivisceral transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611432425">5</xref></sup> This retrospective analysis showed a high incidence of headaches (68%), encephalopathy (43%), and seizures (17%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611432425">5</xref></sup> Less common were central nervous system (CNS) infections, neuromuscular disorders, and ischemic stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611432425">5</xref></sup>

The neurotoxic mechanism remains unclear, but treatment consists of lowering the dose or switching to an alternative immunosuppressant. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is associated with calcineurin inhibitors, is characterized by headache, confusion, seizures, and visual loss with a specific pattern in the MRI of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885066611432425">Figure 3</xref>

<p>The workup of seizures and encephalopathy not directly attributable to immunosuppressant therapy needs to be broad and immediate. A complete metabolic evaluation including ammonia, sodium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations are appropriate. Imaging studies such as CT or MRI of the brain are often required as infarcts may be associated with preexisting hypercoaguable states or dehydration. Hemorrhages are frequently related to coagulopathy and/or infection. Lumbar puncture is very useful for infectious etiologies and to evaluate intracranial pressure.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Improved long-term survival after intestinal and multivisceral transplant has led to increased application of transplantation to patients with irreversible intestinal failure and an increasing number of surviving transplant recipients. Yet because the risk of complications remains high, it is likely that these transplant recipients will continue to require intermittent ICU care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066611432425">2</xref></sup> The management of these patients is extremely challenging, with complications arising in multiple organ systems and often requiring aggressive diagnostics and treatment. Infection and ACR remain the main complications limiting life expectancy, but long-term organ dysfunctions such as chronic kidney failure and chronic lung disease have greater impact on morbidity and mortality as survival improves. Only ongoing collaboration between intensivists and transplant specialists will impact both short-term and long-term complications and improve quality of life.</p>

<abstract>
<p>While genetics clearly influences dental caries risk, few caries genes have been discovered and validated. Recent studies have suggested differential genetic factors for primary dentition caries and permanent dentition caries, as well as for pit-and-fissure- (PF) and smooth- (SM) surface caries. We performed separate GWAS for caries in permanent-dentition PF surfaces (1,017 participants, adjusted for age, sex, and the presence of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>) and SM surfaces (1,004 participants, adjusted for age, education group, and the presence of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>) in self-reported whites (ages 14 to 56 yrs). Caries scores were derived based on visual assessment of each surface of each tooth; more than 1.2 million SNPs were either successfully genotyped or imputed and were tested for association. Two homologous genes were suggestively associated: <italic>BCOR</italic> (Xp11.4) in PF-surface caries (<italic>p</italic> value = 1.8E-7), and <italic>BCORL1</italic> (Xq26.1) in SM-surface caries (<italic>p</italic> value = 1.0E-5). <italic>BCOR</italic> mutations cause oculofaciocardiodental syndrome, a Mendelian disease involving multiple dental anomalies. Associations of other plausible cariogenesis genes were also observed for PF-surface caries (<italic>e.g., INHBA, p</italic> value = 6.5E-6) and for SM-surface caries (<italic>e.g., CXCR1</italic> and <italic>CXCR2, p</italic> value = 1.9E-6). This study supports the notion that genes differentially affect cariogenesis across the surfaces of the permanent dentition, and nominates several novel genes for investigation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental caries is one of the most common diseases worldwide. In the US, the prevalence in adults is approximately 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513481976">Beltran-Aguilar <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and in some high-risk populations, the prevalence is even higher. Treatment of dental caries consumes significant resources each year, and untreated caries lesions can lead to pain, tooth loss, and oral infection, or other co-morbidities.</p>
<p>As a multi-factorial process, cariogenesis is affected by a combination of environmental and behavioral factors, including dietary behaviors, bacterial flora, fluoride intake and exposures, oral hygiene, salivary composition and flow rate, tooth positional and morphological features, genetic predisposition, and gene-by-environment interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513481976">Hunter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513481976">Anderson, 2002</xref>). Despite the acknowledged importance of genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513481976">Townsend <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) and estimates of heritability of 30% to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513481976">Bretz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034513481976">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513481976">Shaffer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012b</xref>), only a few caries susceptibility genes have been identified and validated thus far.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that both shared and unique genetic risk factors may affect dental caries of the primary dentition and permanent dentition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034513481976">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed separately for the 2 dentitions have nominated several biologically plausible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513481976">Shaffer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted), although these genes cumulatively explain only a fraction of the genetic variance of dental caries. In addition, recent work has suggested that the effects of genetic factors on dental caries may differ between pit-and-fissure (PF) and smooth (SM) tooth surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513481976">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>). It has also been well-established that PF surfaces exhibit much greater risk of developing caries lesions than do SM surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513481976">Batchelor and Sheiham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513481976">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2012a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513481976">b</xref>), and progression of decay varies between these surface types. To further study the potential differences in genetic contributions to PF- and SM-surface caries risk, we performed separate GWAS in the permanent dentition for the 2 types of surfaces.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Details on participant recruitment and data collection are available in the Appendix. Only self-reported whites (ages 14 to 56 yrs) with dental caries assessments were included in our study, with 1,063 individuals having data on all covariates for the PF-surface analysis, while 1,049 had data on all covariates for the SM-surface analysis. Two classes of tooth surfaces, PF and SM, were defined by similarities in morphology and risk of developing caries lesions. PF surfaces included buccal and occlusal surfaces of mandibular molars and lingual and occlusal surfaces of maxillary molars. SM surfaces included all other tooth surfaces. Two caries scores were generated, PF D1MFS and SM D1MFS, calculated as the total number of surfaces scored as pre-cavitated, decayed, missing due to decay, or filled for PF and SM surface types.</p>

<title>Genotyping and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Details regarding allele calling, data cleaning, and quality assurance metrics have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513481976">Laurie <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Genotyping was performed on an Illumina platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). We successfully genotyped 1,017 individuals for the PF-surface analysis, and 1,004 for the SM-surface analysis. Genotype data on more than 548,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) passed quality control filters. Un-genotyped SNPs were imputed for 996 individuals in the PF-surface analysis and 982 in the SM-surface analysis. In total, more than 1.2 million SNPs were either genotyped or imputed. Linear regression was used to model additive genetic effects. PF surface analysis was adjusted for the covariates age, sex, and the presence or absence of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>. SM-surface analysis was adjusted for the covariates age, education group (<italic>i.e</italic>., up to high school, some college, four-year degree or beyond), and the presence or absence of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>. Covariates were determined by a forward selection strategy. Association between PF- or SM-surface caries scores and each SNP was tested. We used a conservative threshold of α = 5E-8 to declare genome-wide statistical significance and α = 5E-5 for suggestive significance. Suggestive associations near plausible caries genes were reported among our results. Additional genotyping, covariate selection, and statistical analysis details are provided in the Appendix.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Phenotypes and covariates are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034513481976">Table 1</xref>. The mean D1MFS scores were 9.0 for PF surfaces and 12.2 for SM surfaces. The caries prevalence was 92% for PF surfaces and 82% for SM surfaces. Female participants exhibited more PF- and SM-surface caries than male participants (9.3 <italic>vs</italic>. 8.5 and 12.4 <italic>vs</italic>. 11.9, respectively). No genome-wide significant signal was observed for either PF- or SM-surface scans. Instead, several suggestive associations near biologically plausible caries genes were observed.</p>

No direct role of BCOR in dental caries has been established.

Mouse knockouts for <italic>Inhba</italic> demonstrate disruption of tooth eruption of incisors and mandibular molars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513481976">Ferguson <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513481976">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of activin signaling in tooth development by exogenous soluble receptors as well as mutation of activin receptors IIA and IIB, and Smad2, which are effectors in the activin signaling pathway, produced similar dental aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513481976">Ferguson <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Possibly, INHBA participates in the pathogenesis of caries by affecting tooth morphology.</p>

<title>SM-surface GWAS</title>
<p>The genomic inflation factor (λ) was 1.04 for the SM-surface scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513481976">Fig. 1b</xref>). The most significant association for SM D1MFS was with rs2046315 on chromosome 8q21.3 (<italic>p</italic> value = 7.85E-8) (see Appendix Table 2 for a full list of SNPs with <italic>p</italic> values under 5E-5). This SNP was also suggestively associated with PF D1MFS (<italic>p</italic> value = 6.50E-7). However, no known gene is close to this SNP. The nearest gene, <italic>RIPK2</italic> (receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 2), is 560 kb away. To further annotate SNP rs2046315, we searched the eQTL database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scandb.org/newinterface/about.html">http://www.scandb.org/newinterface/about.html</ext-link>). No gene’s expression is predicted by rs2046315 with <italic>p</italic> value less than .0001 in CEPH (samples of northern and western European ancestry). The Mammal Conservation Score for rs2046315 is -0.128, corresponding to a <italic>p</italic> value of .745 under a null hypothesis of neutral evolution. In other words, this SNP is not conserved across species. In addition, this SNP does not reside on any genomic element identified by the ENCODE project.</p>
<p>A suggestive association was observed on chromosome Xq26.1 near <italic>BCORL1</italic> (BCL6 co-repressor-like 1; rs3788848; <italic>p</italic> value = 1.01E-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034513481976">Fig. 2c</xref>). SNP rs3788848 is located in the 3′ region downstream of <italic>BCORL1</italic> and also in the 3′UTR region of <italic>ELF4</italic>. Of note, chromosome Xq has been reported to be linked to low caries susceptibility. In a genome-wide linkage scan, a marker in Xq27.1 yielded a non-parametric <italic>p</italic> value of 5E-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513481976">Vieira <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). <italic>BCORL1</italic> is a strong transcriptional repressor, so named because of its sequence similarity with <italic>BCOR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513481976">Pagan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Three homologous regions between <italic>BCOR</italic> and <italic>BCORL1</italic> proteins have been identified: a small amino-terminal region and 2 substantial regions spanning 600 amino acids within the central region and 336 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513481976">Pagan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). No known function of <italic>BCORL1</italic> directly relates to cariogenesis. However, it is the only gene similar to <italic>BCOR</italic> in the entire human genome. Furthermore, both the association signals of <italic>BCOR</italic> and <italic>BCORL1</italic> are located on the 3′ ends of the genes. It is interesting to observe such suggestive associations near 2 closely related but physically separated genes.</p>
<p>Several imputed SNPs on chromosome 2q35 were associated with SM D1MFS at the suggestive significance level (<italic>e.g</italic>., rs1079204, located in an intron of <italic>AAMP; p</italic> value = 1.90E-6) near 2 chemokine receptor genes, <italic>CXCR1</italic> and <italic>CXCR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034513481976">Fig. 2d</xref>). These genes are major receptors of interleukin 8, a chemokine that is an essential mediator of the inflammation response. Several studies have shown potential roles for this chemokine and its receptors in the process of oral infection. Increased expression of interleukin 8 has been reported in inflamed human dental pulps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513481976">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). <italic>CXCR1</italic> and <italic>CXCR2</italic> mRNA expressions were found to be related to the presence of certain periodontopathic bacteria in inflamed gingival tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513481976">Noda <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Also, <italic>CXCR2</italic> was reported to be associated with periodontitis in a Brazilian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513481976">Viana <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). These lines of evidence support the view that <italic>CXCR1</italic> and <italic>CXCR2</italic> contribute to cariogenesis by influencing host susceptibility to oral bacteria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we performed separate GWAS to detect genetic variants associated with dental caries of PF and SM surfaces in the permanent dentition. We successfully identified several potential caries genes specific for PF or SM surfaces, including <italic>BCOR</italic> and <italic>BCORL1</italic> (2 X-linked genes with sequence similarity), <italic>INHBA, CXCR1</italic>, and <italic>CXCR2</italic>. Nominated genes were involved in a variety of possible cariogenic processes, such as tooth morphology, tooth development, and immune defense, which is consistent with the prevailing view that the genetic etiology of dental caries includes many genes acting through multiple mechanisms.</p>
<p>A previous family-based study reported that the genetic correlation between PF- and SM-surface caries scores did not significantly differ from 100%. Although this estimate of correlation might be inflated, the 2 surface types are likely to be influenced by the same genetic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513481976">Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>). However, it does not rule out the possibility that different association patterns may be observed and different genes identified for PF- and SM-surface caries, since the “detectable” associated genes might account for only a very small portion of heritability, and there could be many overlapping weak association signals across the 2 surface types that did not meet suggestive significance. Moreover, SNPs within the regions of interest mentioned in the ‘Results’ have <italic>p</italic> values under .05 for both types of surfaces (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022034513481976">Table 2</xref>), indicating a certain level of pleiotropic effect of the “detectable” hits, which could also contribute to genetic correlation. From these points of view, our results do not conflict with the reported high genetic correlation and, furthermore, showed that the subdivision of complex phenotypes was useful for the detection of genes with sub-phenotype-specific effects.</p>

<p>There is consistent evidence across populations for higher caries incidence in female individuals than in male individuals. A similar sex difference was also observed in our current study. While this difference is generally attributed to environmental factors and genetic factors that work through changing individual environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513481976">Lukacs and Largaespada, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513481976">Lukacs, 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513481976">Vieira <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> hypothesized that X-linked genetic variants may partly explain the gender differences in dental caries susceptibility. Our observation of suggestive associations between the X-linked genes <italic>BCOR</italic> and <italic>BCORL1</italic> and caries phenotypes supports their hypothesis. We summarized caries scores by genotypes of the most significant SNPs for the 2 genes (Appendix Table 3). The risk alleles appeared to affect homozygous female participants more severely than hemizygous male participants. The effect of X-linked genes on sex differences in dental caries is an open question and deserves further investigation.</p>
<p>We compared our results with those of a contemporary GWAS, conducted by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (submitted), of total dental caries (caries scores not divided by tooth-surface types) in the permanent dentition, which was based on the same sample as well as additional cohorts. Two suggestive regions in that study also showed suggestive associations in ours (<italic>p</italic> values &lt;5E-5). One is in an intron of <italic>RPS6KA2</italic> for SM surfaces, and the other is near <italic>PTK2B</italic> for both SM and PF surfaces. Both of these genes are involved in the p38-dependent MAPK pathway important for oral-related diseases, including dental caries.</p>
<p>Although this study had many strengths, including well-defined caries phenotypes, high-quality GWAS data, and important environmental covariates, a major limitation was the lack of replication. However, this issue is partly alleviated by the compelling biological evidence for the involvement of the nominated genes in mechanisms related to cariogenesis. In particular, we observed intriguing suggestive associations with <italic>BCOR</italic>, the gene for OFCD syndrome, and <italic>BCORL1</italic>, its only known homologue, for separate caries phenotypes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found different genes that may be associated with PF- and SM-surface dental caries, several of which have plausible biological functions relevant to cariogenesis. These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic pathogenic mechanisms of cariogenesis and, we hope, will lead to more functional studies on the reported genes as well as the search for causal variants.</p>

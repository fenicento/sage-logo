<abstract>
<p>Few studies have compared correctional service experiences of youth in adult prisons and juvenile facilities. This study compared 47 youth in juvenile facilities and 49 youth in adult prisons in Michigan. Controlling for offence history, socioeconomic background, and demographic characteristics, juvenile placement was found to be associated with more positive responses for counseling, medical services, and staff quality. Experiences with the quantity of education and work programs were similar, although the quality of education and work might have differed. Poor correctional services in adult prisons might be a reason for less effective rehabilitation, leading to lower deterrence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Between 1988 and 2000, the majority of states in the United States revised their criminal justice statutes to require the commitment of juveniles who were convicted of selected crimes in adult court to be sentenced to adult prisons. Michigan was one of these states, and it significantly increased the numbers of juveniles, some as young as 14 years, committed to adult prisons. No provision was made for their placement in segregated housing in the prisons, nor was there any provision for special programming. These changes also occurred during a period of the greatest prison overcrowding in Michigan prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032885512457547">Shook &amp; Sarri, 2008</xref>). In Michigan, the numbers of juveniles sentenced below the age of 17 peaked in 1997, but the total numbers continue to be above prelegislations rates in 1988. Moreover, the crime rate by juveniles has continued to decline in 2000 to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032885512457547">Michigan State Police, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the arguments against the incarceration of juveniles in adult prisons are their lack of rehabilitative programs, especially those that target the developmental needs of youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032885512457547">Fagan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032885512457547">Redding, 2003</xref>). If their assertions are correct, there is cause for concern given that most offenders will be released back to the community without having received educational, mental health and employment services that they need if they are not to recidivate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032885512457547">Goebel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0032885512457547">Strom, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Are correctional services in juvenile facilities necessarily better and more targeted for youth? This is a moot question. While some researchers assert that juvenile facilities are more rehabilitative because they are usually governed by more requirements for educational programming and counseling as well as more individualized and nonpunitive treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512457547">Bishop &amp; Frazier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032885512457547">Redding, 2003</xref>), others argue that adult prisons often have targeted programs and separate housing for youthful offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512457547">Kupchik, 2007</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0032885512457547">Austin, Johnson, and Gregoriou (2000)</xref> found few prisons where juveniles were housed separately. Instead most juvenile offenders are housed in the regular prison system (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0032885512457547">Deitch et al., 2009</xref>) with offenders of all ages. Further, they found little evidence of efforts to customize programs for the needs of young offenders in adult prisons. Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032885512457547">Redding (2003)</xref> also noted that overcrowding in both juvenile and adult facilities resulted in inadequate services and treatment in both juvenile and adult facilities.</p>
<p>In Michigan, overcrowding in prisons and budget constraints had led to innovations in correctional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0032885512457547">Michigan Department of Corrections [MDOC], 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0032885512457547">2005</xref>). For example, Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) shifted routine instruction from human teachers to computers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0032885512457547">MDOC, 1998</xref>, p. 35). CAI was slated mainly for adult basic education, with no college education provided unless it is court-mandated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0032885512457547">MDOC, 1998</xref>, pp. 82). Consequently, with savings on human resources in MDOC, none of the prisons claimed to have their own trained treatment or education staff (MDOC, various years). By comparison, each public juvenile facility in Michigan had professionally trained teachers and social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0032885512457547">Dixon, 2007</xref>). Past lawsuits in Michigan over health and mental health services in prisons also signal ongoing problems in the Michigan criminal system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0032885512457547">Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0032885512457547">Hadix v. Caruso, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the above backdrop of innovations in the midst of budget constraints, what are the experiences of youth incarcerated in adult correctional institutions compared to juvenile facilities, as voiced by the youth themselves? This article compares the experiences of 49 youth who were interviewed in adult prisons and 47 youth interviewed in juvenile facilities in Michigan, on their access to work and education programs, counseling, medical services as well as their ratings of staff quality. All respondents were committed before age 17 (age of adult jurisdiction in Michigan), but were unmatched otherwise. Although results from this small study of unmatched respondents in Michigan cannot be generalized, it provides further corroboration of findings from several studies which compared these populations. In addition, studies reflecting the voices of inmates are important because programs, as established, might look very different from programs as experienced by inmates.</p>

<title>Prior Research on Services and Treatment in Penal Institutions</title>
<p>Few studies have compared the correctional service experiences of youth in juvenile and adult incarcerations directly. In their search for answers to understanding the impact of transfers on young people, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512457547">Bishop and Frazier (2000)</xref> opined that most helpful were two studies that compared the views of adolescents who remained in the juvenile system and those who were transferred. The two studies cited were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457547">Forst, Fagan, and Vivona (1989)</xref> and a report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0032885512457547">Bishop et al. (1998)</xref> which was later published as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512457547">Lane, Lanza-Kaduce, Frazier, and Bishop (2002)</xref>. Our search since then unearthed only two more comparative studies. All except one found experiences in juvenile facilities more positive.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457547">Forst et al. (1989)</xref>, 59 juveniles in juvenile facilities were compared with 81 juveniles transferred to prisons in four states. Respondents in juvenile institutions reported that they received more counseling, found treatment more helpful, and rated staff more highly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512457547">Lane et al. (2002)</xref> compared how 144 juveniles rated the impact of their dispositions on recidivism. Half of the respondents received juvenile dispositions and half adult sentences. Adult sanctions—which included imprisonment (majority), probation, and a mixture of both probation and imprisonment—were preferred to “low-end” juvenile sanctions such as probation and short-term and low-supervision residential placements. The reasons were negative, that adult sanction would deter them from reoffending because of how “horrible” (p. 444) prison was. In contrast, “deep-end” juvenile sanctions (e.g. closed institutions) were the most preferred, and for positive reasons, that they “gained life skills, got counseling, and were given hope” (p. 450). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512457547">LaFree (2002)</xref> compared the services available to violent juvenile offenders in New Mexico adult facilities (mostly prisons) with those available to violent offenders in juvenile institutions and those available to violent offenders on probation. The imprisoned juveniles were much less likely to be enrolled in an educational program or a counseling program. However, they had higher rates of work program participation.</p>
<p>One study, however, did find that young people in adult prisons reported higher levels of service availability in adult prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512457547">Kupchik, 2007</xref>). This study included a comparison of 95 youth in juvenile and adult facilities along three dimensions—institutional service availability, staff mentoring, and fairness. Controlling for confounding factors such as demographics and prior history with crime and justice, the study found that inmates in adult prisons gave more favorable ratings for service availability while those in juvenile facilities rated staff mentoring more highly. One reason given for this finding was that young inmates in adult prisons rated higher service availability because educational and work opportunity programs in prisons might be concentrated on young offenders, with the rest of the adult prisoners receiving minimal services. Summing up the findings from the four articles reviewed above that have directly compared juveniles in adult and juvenile placements, only Kupchik made comparisons controlled for possible confounders, and only Kupchik found more positive ratings overall by juveniles in adult prisons.</p>
<p>While direct comparisons of juvenile and adult facilities are few, one might glean insights from studies on conditions in each of the systems separately. Studies assessing programs in juvenile institutions generally conclude that conditions and services are inadequate. For example, in a national survey of youth in residential placement (SYRP) by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), incarcerated youth were found to have higher risks of mental health, health, and educational needs than the general population, but services were found inadequate relative to the risks and needs of these youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032885512457547">Sedlak &amp; McPherson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0032885512457547">Foley (2001)</xref> reviewed the literature and suggested that education for incarcerated youth in juvenile facilities is generally available because of state law requirements regarding school attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0032885512457547">Foley, 2001</xref>). However, the large increases in the incarcerated population over the last several decades have resulted in a decline in education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512457547">Zweig, 2003</xref>). Further, the needs of youth in incarceration are often greater than the educational programming being provided in penal institutions. In the SYRP, the rate of learning disability among respondents was seven times the rate among the general population. Although the majority of SYRP respondents attended school while in custody, only 46% of those with a diagnosed learning disability received special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032885512457547">Sedlak &amp; McPherson, 2010</xref>). Consequently, it is apparent that educational services in juvenile facilities are not necessarily meeting the needs of many youth and that improvements are needed to both increase completion rates and special needs education.</p>
<p>In terms of counseling and mental health programs, the SYRP findings indicate that although mental health services were available in all facilities surveyed, only 47% of youths were in facilities that provided these services to all residents. Given the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457547">Grisso, Vincent, and Seagrave (2005)</xref> that two of three youth in juvenile facilities have a diagnosable mental health disorder, this indicates a substantial gap. They also noted that the likelihood of receiving counseling did not depend upon proper diagnosis. Further, the literature suggests that the effectiveness of programs depends upon the kind of treatment provided. Cognitive-based therapy that focused on changing behavior was found to reduce misconducts in prisons and postprison. On the other hand, nondirective and unstructured counseling was not effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0032885512457547">French &amp; Gendreau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0032885512457547">Mackenzie, 2000</xref>). Physical health care was generally available in juvenile facilities, but usually that at a basic level. Needs in terms of dental, vision and hearing care was often inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032885512457547">Sedlak &amp; McPherson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to services to youth in adult prisons, educational programs are closely tied to work programs that are necessary not only for reintegration, but also for institutional maintenance (e.g., building maintenance, cooking, grounds care). An Urban Institute report, for example, studied training and employment programs in prisons, which included education, vocational training, prison industry, employment/transition training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0032885512457547">Lawrence, Mears, Dubin, &amp; Travis, 2002</xref>). It posited that prison programming of all types decreased as prison populations increased in the 1990s. Because the educational levels of the prison population trailed those of the general population, education programs were identified as the primary programs for rehabilitation. Yet these programs were deemed to be inadequate due to prison crowding and participation rates were low and varied across states (ranging from 6.4% in Illinois to 58.4% in Ohio). The Urban Institute study revealed that for the four different types of employment programs, too much emphasis was placed on occupying prisoners’ time and too little on developing skills for postrelease employment. Furthermore, another study, on a National Supported Work Demonstration Project, found that work programs did not reduce reoffending among individuals in their teens and early 20s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512457547">Uggen, 2000</xref>). These programs only reduced crime for those aged 27 and above. Findings such as these might provide justification for focusing on education and not work with young offenders.</p>
<p>The inadequacy and lack of health care in prisons has provoked a large number of class actions suits. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032885512457547"><italic>Plata v. Davis</italic> (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0032885512457547"><italic>Hadix v. Caruso</italic> (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0032885512457547"><italic>Clark-Murphy v. Foreback</italic> (2006)</xref> have resulted in a number of decisions mandating improved health care in the respective states. Noteworthy for the present study is that the latter two cases were in Michigan. In addition, existing research suggests that health care in prisons is insufficient because prisoners tend to be a population with more medical problems and therefore greater healthcare needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0032885512457547">Anderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512457547">Lindquist &amp; Lindquist, 1999</xref>). The medical needs of prisoners were also highlighted from the perspective of the specific needs of certain populations (e.g., older or women prisoners), the more prevalent types of health needs (e.g., mental health, HIV, TB), and the fact that many prisoners originated from disadvantaged communities that lacked medical facilities. From the perspectives of these specific groups, transitional medical attention for reentry to community was found wanting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0032885512457547">Hammett, Gaiter, &amp; Crawford, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the provision of services, the quality and professionalization of staff is key to shaping the quality of services offered and the relationships that they form with staff. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032885512457547">Redding (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457547">Forst et al. (1989)</xref> suggest that a caring and fair staff is especially important to young offenders. However, this is one area where the different goals of the juvenile and criminal justice systems can be expected to produce contrasting differences in staff treatment of inmates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512457547">Bishop and Frazier (2000)</xref> proposed that while juvenile facilities are supposed to foster messages of caring and to be treatment oriented, a prime concern of prisons is security. In their comparison of preadjudicatory confinement, Bishop &amp; Frazier found that generally, respondents in both jails and juvenile detention centers viewed staffs as indifferent. However, many youths who repeatedly cycled through detention centers reported forming significant attachments to at least one staff member. In contrast, respondents who went through jails reported no such attachments. Instead, they reported that jail officers did not differentiate between them and the chronic and violent adult offenders with whom they were housed.</p>
<p>The review in this section has highlighted that services provided to young people in correctional facilities is lacking, but the problem appears greater in the adult prisons than in juvenile facilities despite the high needs of these youth. As a substantial number of youths are placed in adult facilities, the implications of sending them to adult prisons needs to be better understood. Yet, the research base for direct comparisons is fairly limited and there is a need for more research documenting the differences between experiences in juvenile and adult facilities. This is particularly important in light of research that shows that transferred youth are more likely to recidivate than those retained in juvenile facilities. Several recent reviews have examined this research and have documented these differences in recidivism, attributing some of the differences to the conditions youth experience in the adult system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032885512457547">Fagan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512457547">Hartney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512457547">Redding, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As the only study besides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512457547">Kupchik (2007)</xref> to provide a multivariate comparison of correctional services in juvenile and adult incarceration, the findings in this study will add much needed evidence to the current limited pool of knowledge. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512457547">LaFree (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512457547">Lane et al. (2002)</xref> made no claims to matching their samples of juvenile and adult respondents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457547">Forst et al. (1989)</xref> matched on the same offence criteria. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512457547">Bishop and Frazier (2000)</xref> cautioned that facilities in the jurisdictions that they and Forst et al. studied may not be representative. While the samples in our study were also not matched aside from the fact that all had committed serious crimes before age 17, they included youths placed in a range of institutions in Michigan, thereby accounting for different types of services offered in a range of institutions.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>This study compares the responses of youth in juvenile and adult placements on four types of correctional services: formal education, work and employment, counseling, healthcare, and staff quality. The questions on services were collected as part of a larger study of juveniles committed to adult prisons in Michigan. Interviews were conducted with a sample of 47 youth in the Department of Human Services (DHS), which had jurisdiction over juvenile facilities, and 49 youth from the Department of Corrections (DOC), which had jurisdiction over adult facilities. Cases were selected by administrators in DHS and DOC along two main criteria. As one aim of the larger study was to learn how the youth were being prepared for reentry and reintegration back to their home communities, all cases were identified as meeting the criteria of being released from their respective facilities within 6 months. The more important criterion was that all selected cases had to be committed for crimes that were committed below the age of 17, the age of adult court jurisdiction in Michigan. As such, both samples entered a closed juvenile facility or an adult prison at the median of 16 years and were getting ready for release into the community.</p>
<p>The juvenile sample included 33 youth who were briefly residing in five halfway houses who were responsible for preparing the youth for release from the DHS plus an additional 14 who were referred directly from two state training schools. All of these youth had spent 3 or more years in the state training schools in Michigan. The youth were interviewed in private rooms or corners at the respective facilities. The 49 youth in adult prisons were identified by the DOC as individuals who had been included in the larger sample of 2,240 youth sentenced as juveniles to the Department of Corrections between 1985 and 2004. The interviews were conducted in eight different prisons in Michigan, and all took place in private rooms with no staff present. The median length of stay for those in adult prisons was 5 years, but some of these youth had been released on parole earlier, reoffended and returned to prison and were ready for discharge at the time of the interviews.</p>
<p>A limitation of the sample of youth in adult facilities is that it did not include youth who had life or very long sentences because they were ineligible for release. For example those convicted of first degree murder were excluded whereas the juvenile sample did include youth who had been placed in facilities for very serious felonies, including murder. Also excluded were individuals over the age of 30 who had been imprisoned as juveniles so as to have closer age comparability of both samples. Another limitation is that the sampling strategy did not match specific offense and offender characteristics across the two samples. Having a matched sample would have been impossible given the focus of the larger study to examine the preparation of the youth for reentry. The court systems varied for these two populations especially with respect to sentencing and discharge decisions. Although we controlled for some of these offense factors in the multiple regressions, it is possible that any differences in service receipt may be a result of differences in a individual youth’s characteristics.</p>
<p>While recognizing that the profiles of these two groups are not closely comparable, a major strength of the sample is that youth were drawn from a range of state run correctional institutions in both the juvenile and adult justice systems. Thus, our findings are not particular to a specific institution or group of offenders, but represent the experiences of individuals across those two systems as many of these youth were likely to be in a number of different institutions during their time in the systems.</p>
<p>The procedures and instruments for this study were all approved by the Behavioral Science Institution Review Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan on April 12, 2006, followed by periodic reviews until the study was completed in 2009. A privacy certificate was obtained from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development on July 28, 2006 to assure proper procedures and to protect the research staff in the event of subpoena.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Our analysis applied multiple regression, where the dichotomous variable of incarceration in an adult corrections institution (DOC = 1) as opposed to placement in a juvenile facility (DOC = 0) was regressed on services variables as dependent variables.

<list-item><p>Counseling was analyzed using three variables: (a) whether counseling was required (<italic>yes</italic> = 1); (b) number of counseling hours received per week only for those who answered that they received counseling; and (c) whether respondent preferred to see a counselor more (<italic>yes</italic> = 1).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medical services had two variables: (a) frequency of seeing medical doctor or nurse (1 = <italic>never</italic> to 4 = <italic>once a month or more</italic>); and (b) whether respondent ever wanted to see a doctor but was not able to (<italic>yes</italic> = 1).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To measure the quality of staff, a scale was created from the summation of ten questions asking respondents to rate from 1 for <italic>no staff</italic> to 4 for <italic>most staff</italic> the proportion of staff who met the descriptions below. All 10 items loaded well together, and had a high consistency value of α = .89. The items included (a) show little concern for my well-being (reverse-coded); (b) treat me unfairly (reverse-coded); (c) treat me with respect; (d) emphasize education; (e) emphasize treatment; (f) are positive role models; (g) punish us for things we did not do (reverse-coded); (h) are unclear about expectations (reverse-coded); (i) help us with family problems; and (j) help us get along with each other.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Among the independent variables, the main variable of interest was whether the respondent was incarcerated under the Department of Corrections (DOC = 1) for adult incarceration or the Department of Human Services (DOC = 0) for juvenile incarceration. The other variables served as controls to “DOC.”</p>
<p>First, the types of services received are likely to be related to the seriousness and persistence of offending history. Risk assessments are often conducted to evaluate the types of programs inmates need for discipline while incarcerated and rehabilitation towards reintegration. Offence history was measured in three ways. First, a dichotomous variable was created from five types of offenses for which the current placements were meted out. Person or weapons offences were considered more serious and given the value 1. Property, drug, or status offences were considered less serious and took the value 0. The second and third offense history variables identified a persistent offender by the age at which the respondent was arrested for the first offence and the number of times the respondent has ever been arrested. Age of first arrest was rated as a ranked variable from below 10 years old to 17 years old, with one year increment in between. Each of the three measures are limited reflections of offence history, but three imperfect measures together provided relatively good controls for offender characteristics that might have led to the type of programming received by respondents.</p>
<p>Receipt of services might also be related to family background factors such as being poor or a foster child. Individuals from impoverished families or those that grew up in the foster care system are often in more need of services. In addition, they might be less forthcoming or capable at accessing in-prison services, or, particularly in the case of those who were in the foster care system, they might be skeptical of services. Consequently, we included two dummy variables, one for whether one’s family was on public assistance while growing up (proxy for poverty) and one for having been in foster care.</p>
<p>Whether one is referred for services should depend also on one’s need for such services, e.g. due to mental health problems or substance abuse problems. Prison populations have been identified to have high prevalence of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0032885512457547">Abram, Teplin, McClelland, &amp; Dulcan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457547">Grisso et al., 2005</xref>). One indicator of mental health in the survey was a set of 20 self-reported questions from the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0032885512457547">Radloff, 1977</xref>). Each answer in the CES-D scale ranged from 0 to 3, so that after summing the 20 individual items, those with scores above 16 were classified as depressed. Substance abuse was also added as a control, where respondents were classified as abusers of substances if their lifetime use of (a) marijuana or hashish, (b) prescription drugs without doctor’s prescription, or (c) cocaine, crack, heroin, or methamphetamine, were forty or more times.</p>
<p>Finally, services might be offered and accepted differentially by inmates of different ethnicity, sex, and age. In this analysis, age was expressed in years; ethnicity as a dummy for white respondents; and sex as a dummy for female respondents. The base group was therefore minority male youths.</p>

<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>Empirical studies are currently reverting from logistic regression to linear regressions for binary dependent variables, after critical research such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0032885512457547">Mood (2010)</xref> which pointed out the inaccuracy of estimates derived from logistic regression. Due to the functional form of the logistic model, its estimates reflect not only the effects of the independent variable of interest, but also unobserved heterogeneity in the empirical model. Therefore, whether reported as coefficients, odds ratios, or probability changes, estimates from logistic regression are not comparable across different empirical models with different sets of variables. Linear probability models (linear regression with binary dependent variables) have been proposed as a more accurate alternative to logistic models. Although a linear model is a wrong functional form for binary variables, the probability measures are felt to be less problematic unless many predicted values fall beyond the 0 to 1 range.</p>
<p>In light of the above empirical development, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used as the empirical model for our analysis of all ten dependent variables. This includes the binary variables (whether working, whether in education program, whether counseling required, whether wants more counseling, whether not able to see doctor) and the rank-ordered variable (Frequency of seeing doctor).</p>
<p>The regressions were done after multiple imputation of the data, due to missing observations in some variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032885512457547">Table 1</xref> lists the number of cases in DOC and DHS for each variable. Missing data was particularly high for hours of work and education (12%-17%), the counseling variables for the DOC sample (4%-16%), age of first arrest for the DHS sample (14.9%), and number of arrests for DHS (25.5%).</p>

<p>Difference between respondents in adult and juvenile incarceration significantly different at 5%.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The pattern seems to be that the group with more negative answers had more missing data. The DOC sample reported worse service outcomes and had more nonresponse for the education and counseling variables; the DHS sample had more negative offender characteristics and had more missing arrest information. The data is therefore not missing at random (NMAR). This is problematic because multiple imputation requires an assumption of missing at random, especially since it is the dependent variables that were missing. Imputing dependent variables might result in overestimation. However, with good auxiliary variables (i.e., variables used in imputation but not in the analysis) and a correctly specified model for the missing data mechanism, multiple imputation can provide unbiased and efficient estimates due to the random component generated by multiple imputation. While it is possible to identify good auxiliary variables (those with moderate to high correlation with the variables having missing data), there is no statistic to help identify whether a missing data model is appropriate. One approach is to try different imputation models and test whether estimates are sensitive to the model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0032885512457547">Allison, 2009</xref>, for explanation of imputation when missing cases are NMAR or reside in dependent variables).</p>
<p>The current data had a few good candidates for auxiliary variables, and different imputation models changed the significant results minimally. The final imputation model used three auxiliary variables and yielded conservative estimates that were not more significant than an analysis with pairwise deletion. “Whether respondents attended counseling” had complete data and was naturally highly correlated to the counseling variables. It also had moderate correlation with the other services variables and a few independent variables, such as age of first arrest. “Frequency of family visits” was a rating from 1 for <italic>never</italic> to 6 for <italic>weekly</italic>. It had low correlation with the dependent variables but high correlation with some independent variables, namely frequency of arrest, current age, and foster care. Being from Wayne County was an interesting auxiliary variable. This County is probably best known for the city of Detroit, which hails the state’s highest crime and poverty rates. For juvenile justice, on the other hand, Detroit has implemented creative diversionary programs for juveniles and also sentenced very few youth to adult facilities because there was a provision in the transfer laws that allowed them to try a juvenile as an adult, but then place them in a juvenile facility and exonerate them at 21 years if that had not committed another violation. Therefore, juveniles from Wayne County have a higher likelihood of juvenile placements. As a result, the variable correlates relatively well with both the dependent and independent variables. In particular, since the population of Detroit is large and made up of majority African Americans, the change in the system in Wayne County had led to lower rates of African American youth in adult prisons than in juvenile facilities.</p>
<p>Multiple imputation was done using the ICE command in STATA with five data sets. All the dependent, independent, and auxiliary variables were used in the all the imputations, except for the work and education variables. As hours of work was derived from whether the respondent was in a work program, hours of work was excluded from the imputation of being in a work program and vice versa. This was also the case for the two education variables. The other variables were relatively independent.</p>
<p>As the purpose of imputation was to generate predicted values of the imputed variables, and not to analyze coefficient estimates of regressions, the standard regressions were applied to each type of imputed variables: linear regressions for continuous variables, logistic regressions for binary variables, and ordered logistic regression for the rank-ordered variable.</p>

<sec id="section7-0032885512457547">
<title>Sample Profile</title>
<p>The descriptive statistics of the variables indicate that the youth in adult incarceration rated lower on services but that the youth in juvenile placements had more disadvantaged backgrounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032885512457547">Table 1</xref>). Youth in adult prisons had more negative responses to all the service variables except hours at work per day. However, only the differences in hours of education, counseling attendance, hours of counseling, frequency of medical visits, and quality of staff were significant. The youth in DHS, on the other hand, had committed more serious offences, experienced their first arrest at a younger age, and were more likely poor. However, they reported lower numbers of arrests. They were also younger and more likely to be females.</p>
<p>Indeed, one limitation of the data is the overrepresentation of certain profiles of respondents. There were only two females in the adult prison sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032885512457547">1</xref></sup> The respondents in DOC were also much older, even though they had all been initially committed to DOC before their 17th birthday (age of adult jurisdiction). The mean (and median) age at the time of the interview was 24 years for the DOC group compared to 18 years for the DHS group. The above limitations in getting more closely matched samples were due to the difficulty of interviewing respondents in the various facilities scattered around Michigan, based on lists generated by headquarter administration.</p>
<p>The descriptive statistics of the auxiliary variables for the multiple imputation are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0032885512457547">Table 2</xref>. A higher percent of youth in juvenile placements received counseling and originated from Wayne County, but there were no significant differences in the frequency of visits from family members.</p>

<p>As the table shows, respondents in adult prisons reported lower probability of working than those in the juvenile system. In fact, the probability of working in the adult system was 63 percentage points lower than that in a juvenile placement. However, there were no significant differences in the number of hours of work that respondents reported. This indicates that, accounting for other factors, juvenile facilities offered more work opportunities to respondents but the number of hours worked across these two systems were similar.</p>
<p>As noted above, no significant differences were found with regard to receipt of education services. However, the multivariate results mask differences in terms of types of education received. More respondents in the juvenile sample were in high school and college programs, whereas more respondents in the adult sample were in GED and vocational programs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0032885512457547">Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, the qualitative components of our interviews suggest that in the adult system, GED education was largely by self-study and that the vocational programs were tied to work that inmates were assigned to. Hence, while the quantity of education received was not found to be different, the quality of education might well be.</p>

<p>The differences in counseling, medical attention, and staff quality were significant. Although there was no significant difference in counseling being required in the two types of incarceration, DOC respondents received seven fewer hours of counseling and their probability of wanting more counseling were 58 percentage points more than the DHS respondents. For medical services, DOC respondents rated one point lower in the ranked frequency of doctor visits than DHS respondents, and their probability of not being able to see a doctor when needed was 57 percentage points more than their counterparts in DHS. DOC respondents also rated staff quality 12 points lower than DHS respondents.</p>
<p>For the control variables, older respondents had fewer hours of counseling and lower frequency of seeing a doctor. The rest of the covariates were significantly associated with only one of the ten service variables, or none at all. Overall, it is striking that the effects of the control variables are mostly insignificant, yet the negative effects of adult incarceration on correctional services held for six out of the ten models.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Controlling for factors that might influence service use, including offence history, receipt of public assistance, foster care, depression, substance abuse, age, race, and sex, the conclusion is clear: youth sent to adult prison as juveniles in this Michigan study generally experienced fewer services than youth in juvenile facilities and reported considerably lower staff quality. This conclusion concurs with a few other studies that have compared these two populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457547">Forst et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512457547">LaFree, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512457547">Lane et al., 2002</xref>). However, it differs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512457547">Kupchik (2007)</xref>, who found that adult inmates reported better institutional services. Kupchik’s institutional service index averaged affirmative answers to whether the following were available: library, religious services, counseling, family care/parenting classes, job training, education, drug treatment, and other. It would have been interesting to see whether the 10 individual services in its index were significantly different for the two groups of respondents. In the present analysis, while the Michigan adult-placed inmates did not have less access to education, they did report receiving less counseling, wanting more counseling, seeing a doctor less frequently, and wanting to see a doctor more. In both studies, staff was rated more negatively by adult-placed inmates. The agreement in the findings on staff quality, in particular, might reflect the more caring orientation of the juvenile system in contrast to the more security orientation of the prison system.</p>
<p>What accounts for the differences in the findings for the other services variables? It might be that the adult sample in this study was older.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032885512457547">2</xref></sup> It is possible that more services might have been offered when they were younger. However, a number of studies cited earlier (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0032885512457547">Austin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0032885512457547">Deitch et al., 2009</xref>) have found that there is an overall lack of separate services for youth in adult prisons. While the age gap in the juvenile and adult samples in our study is wider than that in Kupchik, 24 is still young relative to the rest of the prison population. Youth at this age still crucially require education, work, medical, and other services that are important as investments towards reintegration in the community.</p>
<p>Besides the age gap between our samples from the adult and juvenile systems (24 years old for the DOC sample and 18 years old for the DHS sample), the DHS sample also consisted of more serious offenders. Indeed, a limitation of this study is that the two samples were not matched. The main basis for comparison was that if not for tougher legislation and decision making practices at the county level, both groups would have remained in the juvenile system. Yet, as noted previously, the strength of the study is that the sample included young people placed across a range of institutions in the juvenile and adult justice systems and tapped into services being provided prior to a youth transitioning back to the community. Consequently, its findings are not limited to a particular institution or type of offender, but, instead, account for the services offered in a range of institutions. This is important because young people in the justice systems vary considerably and their experiences often include spending time at different facilities. Further, it is important because services delivered prior to a youth transitioning back to the community can be instrumental to increasing the likelihood of a successful reentry.</p>
<p>The differences that we found across these systems are important for two of reasons. First, both samples of juvenile and adult-placed respondents in our study were being prepared for discharge. Yet, the older group in DOC was being released into the community at an older age but, potentially, more disadvantaged in terms of rehabilitation. Hence, despite the limited comparability in terms of age and severity of offences committed by respondents, the findings in this study indicate the need for considering service quality as another factor that might undo the intended deterrent effect of a policy to punish juveniles more harshly by transferring them to the adult system. If services for rehabilitation and reintegration are inferior in adult prisons, specific deterrence will be less effective.</p>
<p>Second, despite decreases in violent and serious juvenile crime, more juveniles in Michigan continue to be committed to adult prisons than prior to the legislative reforms of the last several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032885512457547">Shook &amp; Sarri, 2008</xref>). These juveniles include many less serious offenders who will be released from prison at relatively young ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032885512457547">Shook &amp; Sarri, 2008</xref>). Consequently, there is a need to consider the access to and quality of services that these transferred offenders are receiving in the criminal justice system. There is a need to consider whether these services can be better delivered in the juvenile system and whether we need to rethink transfer policies and practices.</p>
<p>The budgetary constraints outlined in the beginning of this article might have affected programs in adult facilities more than juvenile facilities, and might have contributed to the differential service quality found in this study. Since 2008, Michigan has experienced more cuts to corrections budgets. However, as crime rates have also declined, leading to smaller incarcerated populations in both adult and juvenile facilities, there have been no measurable changes in correctional or juvenile services, except in two areas. First, a decrease in educational programs in prisons has been noted, and this is consistent with the findings in this study. Second, many adult and juvenile programs (such as health and food services) have been privatized. However, little is known of service quality after privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0032885512457547">Evans, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0032885512457547">Michigan House of Representatives Fiscal Agency, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>More research on the service experiences of juveniles is needed. Further research could compare more and finer dimensions of services, and be developed into measures of the quality of correctional services received. This study was interested in services as the outcome. It did not consider whether services were effective towards end outcomes such as recidivism or postrelease employment. For example, counseling was queried generally without differentiating the type of counseling (e.g., CBT or drug related). Further, although we found no differences in terms of quantity of education, our data suggests that the types of education were different. Even the delivery of these different types of education might be different. From the qualitative components of our interviews, while the juvenile educational programs have qualified teachers and regular high school curriculum, GED programming in adult prisons was often simply a self-study program. Vocational training was also often a result of work orders needed for institutional maintenance.</p>
<p>More research comparing correctional services for juveniles in juvenile and adult facilities can contribute to filling the knowledge gap of what happens between an adult sentence and reoffending. Might inferior services in adult prisons be the reason? The findings in this study suggest that it might be the case.</p>

<p>In Kupchik, adult inmates were 1 to 2 years older than juvenile inmates. Hence, Kupchik and our studies compared adult-placed and juvenile-placed inmates on different dimensions. While Kupchik maintained comparability by age, this study compared only youth who would have been considered juvenile at the time of arrest.</p>

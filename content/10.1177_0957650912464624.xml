<abstract>
<p>Owing to the high energy content of hydrogen and the possibility of converting this energy in fuel cell devices into electric power without any pollutant emissions, hydrogen has grown to be one of the most useful sources of energy, especially if it is produced from renewable sources. In recent years, the development of an efficient process for hydrogen production has become an important goal for energy researchers. Numerous studies have evaluated the catalytic reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production both experimentally and thermodynamically. To enhance hydrogen production and make the production process efficient, researchers have investigated different reforming processes under a wide range of operating conditions. Moreover, the main focus of these studies was the development of a high-performance reforming catalyst that can increase the hydrogen yield and decrease carbon formation and processing costs. Several reforming processes can be used to produce hydrogen from glycerol. This article reviews these reforming processes with emphasis on the common catalysts and the operating conditions used in thermodynamic analyses and experimental work. Although most of these studies have been conducted on steam and aqueous-phase reforming processes, more work on other reforming processes, such as autothermal reforming, partial oxidation, supercritical water, and photo-catalytic reforming, has yet to be completed.</p>

<p>Hydrogen, as the most abundant element in the universe and with an energy yield 2.75 times by mass higher than that of an average hydrocarbon fuel, appears to be the most beneficial future source of energy, especially if it is produced from renewable resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912464624">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912464624">2</xref></sup> Other factors that make hydrogen attractive as an energy source include the pollution caused by the continuous demand for energy and the depletion of fossil-fuel reserves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912464624">3</xref></sup> Although it is widely available, only small traces of hydrogen can be found in its free state. Its unavailability in its free form on the earth is the greatest hindrance to the utilisation of hydrogen as fuel, and the need to explore new hydrogen production technologies is therefore essential. Many hydrogen production technologies have already been established, including electrolysis, thermal decomposition, solar energy cycles, production from nuclear power energy, gasification, biological hydrogen production, and reforming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912464624">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, in rich biomass countries, biomass plays an important role as a renewable alternative source of hydrogen. For example, in tropical countries that contain extensive agricultural plantations, such as jatropha oil, palm oil, and sugar cane plantations, and massive agriculture production, the use of bio-fuels (such as glycerol), which is produced during the transesterification process of vegetables into biodiesel fuel, would be an ideal choice. In these countries, for example, the use of such bio-fuel in energy production would be more efficient than water electrolysis. Moreover, bio-fuel has a lesser effect on the global climate due to the consumption of the CO<sub>2</sub> produced during the hydrogen production by the further generation of biomass. Technologies used to produce hydrogen from this source are appealing options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912464624">4</xref></sup> Glycerol also can be produced by hydrogenolysis from propylene oxide, sorbitol or by fermentation from glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912464624">5</xref></sup> Many processes have used glycerol as a starting material in the synthesis of a variety of compounds; glycerol has recently become viewed as a desirable bio-renewable fuel for energy generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912464624">6</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912464624">Table 1</xref> shows the main processes that use glycerol as a raw material.

<p>Because 1 mol of glycerol can theoretically produce up to 7 mol of hydrogen gas, its utilisation in hydrogen production would be a potentially economically viable and environmentally friendly option. One possible option for the efficient conversion of glycerol into hydrogen is the steam reforming process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912464624">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, glycerol is an oxygenated hydrocarbon with high boiling point and is biodegradable, non-flammable, non-toxic and safe to handle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912464624">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unlike the case with ethanol, few studies have been performed on the reforming of glycerol to produce hydrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912464624">8</xref></sup> In the literature, the reforming processes used to produce hydrogen from glycerol include steam reforming,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912464624">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912464624">10</xref></sup> partial oxidation (gasification),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912464624">11</xref></sup> aqueous-phase reforming (APR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912464624">12</xref></sup> autothermal reforming,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912464624">11</xref></sup> supercritical-water reforming,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912464624">13</xref></sup> and photo-reforming processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912464624">14</xref></sup> Reviewing hydrogen production reforming processes that use glycerol as a substrate material, especially photo-reforming, which has not been reviewed before, is the goal of this article. The review includes thermodynamic analyses; experimental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, catalyst loading, and reactant ratios; catalysts; reactions pathways; and catalyst preparation methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650912464624"><title>Thermodynamic studies</title>
<p>The importance of thermodynamic studies stems from their capability to provide the required information on conditions that are favoured for hydrogen production. Such studies can potentially predict the operating conditions, such as the temperature, pressure and reactant ratios, that prevent carbon formation and avoid undesirable side effects. Coke formation on the catalyst surface deteriorates its activity because of the reduced surface area and reduced heat transfer between the gas and the catalyst and also plugs the void space within the catalyst, which negatively affects the efficiency of the reforming process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912464624">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, the undesirable side effects will result increased production of by-products and minimise hydrogen production. In conclusion, to avoid the conditions that promote coke and the formation of side products and to make the hydrogen production process efficient, thermodynamic analysis must be performed as a prior step to the experimental work.</p>
<p>Glycerol reforming for hydrogen production is a new process and is still under investigation. To this point, only a few thermodynamic studies on this process have been reported. The aim of all these studies is to analyse the effects of the operating variables on the production of hydrogen. Adhikari et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957650912464624">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957650912464624">28</xref></sup> has thermodynamically studied the reaction conditions on the glycerol reforming process based on the minimisation of the Gibbs free energy (i.e. a stoichiometric thermodynamic analysis approach). They found that the conditions of atmospheric pressure, a temperature greater than 900 K, and a water-to-glycerol molar ratio (WGMR) of 9:1 are the best conditions for hydrogen production. Thermodynamically, under these conditions, the formation of coke is inhibited, and methane production is minimised. They also found that the greatest number of moles of hydrogen was obtained at 960 K and began to decrease at higher temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912464624">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A non-stoichiometric thermodynamic analysis based on the minimisation of the Gibbs free energy was conducted on the adsorption-enhanced steam reforming process of glycerol for hydrogen production by Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957650912464624">29</xref></sup> In their study, they reported that the use of a CO<sub>2</sub>-adsorbent material improves the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen, where the moles of hydrogen increased from six to seven compared to the process without CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption. The best conditions for hydrogen production, based on their analysis, are a reforming temperature between 800 and 850 K, which is approximately 100 K lower than the process without a CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbent, and a WGMR of 9:1, which is similar to that observed by Adhikari et al. With respect to the operating pressure, they found that a higher pressure is favoured for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, whereas lower pressures give a higher overall hydrogen conversion.</p>
<p>Another study on the thermodynamic analysis of glycerol steam reforming has been performed by Dieuzeide and Amadeo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957650912464624">30</xref></sup> They have used two different models in their study. In the first model, CO was proposed as a primary product, whereas CO<sub>2</sub> was the primary product in the second model. They stated that operating at an elevated temperature and at a high water-to-glycerol molar ratio favours hydrogen production. With respect to the effect of pressure, their analysis showed that an increase in the pressure at low temperatures (&lt;900 K) favours methane and coke formation; however, this effect was opposite when the temperature was greater than 900 K. Furthermore, Rossi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957650912464624">31</xref></sup> have used a nonlinear programming model based on Gibbs free energy for thermodynamic analysis of the steam reforming of ethanol and glycerol to produce hydrogen. Their evaluation results showed the same optimum conditions as those established by Adhikari et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957650912464624">27</xref></sup> In agreement with the studies mentioned above, the thermodynamic analysis of glycerol steam reforming by Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957650912464624">32</xref></sup> showed that the optimum conditions for hydrogen production are temperatures between 925 and 975 K and WGMR of 9-12:1 at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>From these results, it can be concluded that the conditions of atmospheric pressure, a temperature greater than 900 K, and WGMR of 9:1 are thermodynamically favourable conditions for hydrogen production by the steam reforming of glycerol.</p>
<p>For the autothermal reforming process, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957650912464624">33</xref></sup> analysed the effect of thermodynamic properties on the production of hydrogen from glycerol based on the minimisation of the Gibbs free energy. They studied the effect of temperature, the steam-to-glycerol ratio and the oxygen-to-glycerol ratio on hydrogen production. Their results showed that the optimum conditions for hydrogen production are at 900–1000 K, a steam-to-glycerol ratio of 9–12:1, and an oxygen-to-glycerol ratio of 1:0.0–0.4. Under these conditions, the production of hydrogen reaches its maximum, and the formation of methane and carbon are effectively eliminated.</p>
<p>Kale and Kulkarni<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957650912464624">34</xref></sup> conducted a thermodynamic analysis on the dry autothermal reforming process of glycerol. They evaluated the effect of temperature, OCGR [feed O<sub>2</sub>/C (C of glycerol only) ratio] and CGR [feed CO<sub>2</sub>/glycerol ratio] on the autothermal reforming efficiency. The best conditions for hydrogen production, according to their study, were obtained at 1 bar, 926.31 K, OCGR = 0.3 and CGR = 1.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic analysis of the aqueous reforming process to produce hydrogen from glycerol was also established by Luo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957650912464624">35</xref></sup> In this analysis, three different aqueous reforming processes have been studied: autothermal reforming (a combination of aqueous-phase reforming and oxidation), aqueous hydrogen peroxide reforming and water aqueous reforming. Their study showed that the formation of methane, as a side product of the reforming process, has a negative effect on hydrogen formation and dramatically decreases its amount in the gaseous product. In the absence of methane, the water aqueous reforming gives the greatest amount of hydrogen produced, followed by aqueous autothermal reforming and aqueous hydrogen peroxide reforming.</p>
<p>For aqueous autothermal and aqueous hydrogen peroxide reforming, CO formation mainly depends on temperature, whereas H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> formation are largely dependent on the O<sub>2</sub>/glycerol ratio in the first process and on the weight fraction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in water in the second process.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the mentioned studies unambiguously indicates that thermodynamics plays a big role in specifying the ideal reaction pathway conditions that can maximise hydrogen production and minimise the undesirable side effects, such as dehydrogenation, dehydration and decomposition; the minimisation of these effects reduces the required energy and the production costs and makes the process more efficient. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650912464624">Table 2</xref> summarises the most favourable thermodynamic conditions, as evaluated by the previously mentioned thermodynamic analysis, for gases and coke produced from the steam reforming of glycerol.

<p>In the reforming processes, hydrogen in its elemental form can be produced pursuant to the breaking of hydrocarbon molecules in the presence of a catalyst. As a result, the reforming processes become a common method for the production of hydrogen in its unbound molecular form from hydrocarbon fuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957650912464624">36</xref></sup> To minimise the production costs, which represent the main issue in choosing the production method and to increase the glycerol conversion and hydrogen yield, researchers have developed several reforming techniques and several types of catalysts.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0957650912464624"><title>Catalysts</title>
<p>The purpose of using catalysts in the reforming process is to activate the reaction and, as a result, to produce the maximum possible amount of hydrogen from the reactants. The selectivity of catalysts toward the main product and its resistance to degradation are the most important factors. Improving these factors is essential because they play a significant role in enhancing hydrogen production and reducing the activation energy required to reform hydrocarbons. The selection of the catalyst used in the reforming process depends on the feedstock. Usually, nickel-based catalysts are used in the reforming of glycerol; however, the major problem associated with nickel catalysts is coke formation. Noble metals are also used as main catalysts and as catalyst promoters, but they are expensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957650912464624">36</xref></sup> The most common catalyst supports in the reforming of hydrocarbons to hydrogen are α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO, MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2.</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957650912464624">37</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912464624">Table 3</xref> summarises the common catalysts used for glycerol reforming.

<sec id="sec5-0957650912464624"><title>Catalyst preparation</title>
<p>Because of the importance of catalysts in the reforming process, researchers have made extensive efforts to prepare catalysts that exhibit improved characteristics toward hydrogen production. Different methods of catalyst preparation, such as impregnation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912464624">9</xref></sup> precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0957650912464624">46</xref></sup> and sol-gel synthesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957650912464624">32</xref></sup> have been performed by researchers. Although the sol-gel method is still under investigation in terms of the synthesis of catalysts for glycerol reforming, impregnation and precipitation are the most commonly used methods. In the impregnation process, the active metal precursor is dissolved in an aqueous or organic solution. The mixture is then added to a catalyst-support solution. After stirring for a certain time, the catalyst is dried and calcined to eliminate the volatile components within the solution, which results in the deposition of the metal on a catalyst surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0957650912464624">56</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec6-0957650912464624"><title>Catalyst characterisation</title>
<p>Because of its significance in examining the nature of active, selective and stable catalysts, the characterisation step is required to identify the structural properties of catalysts. Several tools can be used to study the physical and chemical characteristics of catalysts. The most common tools are X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), BET surface area measurements, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957650912464624">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0957650912464624">57</xref></sup> Whereas the XRD technique is usually used to identify the crystalline phases inside catalysts, XPS is used to analyse the surface (to a depth of approximately 10 nm) of the catalysts. The Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) isotherms are used to measure the surface area of catalysts based on the physical adsorption of gases onto a solid surface. The microstructural investigation of certain catalyst particles can be performed using SEM. In addition, a powerful tool for investigating the local physical and chemical structure of catalyst atoms is X-ray adsorption spectroscopy. Moreover, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a useful tool used to identify both the organic and inorganic compounds present in the solid, liquid, or gas phase as well as the types of chemical bonds. TGA is used to study solid–gas systems by measuring the loss or gain in weight of the catalyst as a function of the composition of the atmosphere and the temperature. Using this tool, we can specify the reduction temperature of the metal oxide. Finally, the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) technique is used to reduce the metal oxide in catalyst samples. In this process, a reducing agent (usually hydrogen) is required to reduce the metal oxide.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0957650912464624"><title>Steam reforming</title>
<p>Among the existing reforming processes, steam reforming is the most widely used process for hydrogen production in the chemical industry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912464624">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0957650912464624">58</xref></sup> especially from methane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0957650912464624">59</xref></sup> Approximately 90% of the hydrogen available on the market is produced by the steam reforming of natural gas. Pursuant to the high-energy state that hydrogen possesses, which is higher than that of the hydrocarbons, the steam reforming reaction is endothermic. Energy is needed for this process to break up the C-C and H-C bonds in the hydrocarbon chain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957650912464624">36</xref></sup> The consumption of energy during the process is the major drawback of steam reforming. Because of the endothermic nature of the reaction, steam reforming has been classified as a low start-up process.</p>
<p>The advantages of this process are that it can operate at low pressures and can produce higher concentrations of hydrogen with high fuel conversion compared to other reforming processes. Moreover, the reformers can be sustained at study-state operation for a prolonged period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0957650912464624">60</xref></sup> However, high-temperature reforming is highly favourable for the decomposition of glycerol to CH<sub>4</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912464624">1</xref></sup> In addition, significant quantities of CO may be produced and hydrogen may be consumed through the reverse water-gas shift reaction at high temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957650912464624">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) is another parameter that should be carefully controlled in the steam reforming process. Sufficient steam will lead to high process conversion and suppress CO formation. Furthermore, insufficient or excessive steam will lead to carbon formation, which causes degradation of the catalyst activity and a decrease in process efficiency because of the vapourisation energy required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957650912464624">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>In steam reforming, glycerol will reform into hydrogen and other products in a vapour catalytic reaction phase that occurs at a high temperature (e.g. 900 K) and at low pressure (e.g. 1 atm)

It gives a maximum hydrogen selectivity of 74.7% compared to Ni/MgO and Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub>, which give 38.6% and 28.3%, respectively, when the three catalysts are operated under the same experimental conditions of a WGMR of 12:1, a temperature of 600 °C, and a feed flow rate (FFR) of 0.5 mL/min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957650912464624">40</xref></sup> They also performed another experiment on glycerol steam reforming for hydrogen production over nickel catalysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0957650912464624">68</xref></sup> They found that running the process at 650 °C and 1 atm using Ni/MgO brought the hydrogen production rate to its maximum. Four moles of a maximum stoichiometric seven were produced in this process. In addition, in a different study, they examined the effect of nickel and several noble-metal based catalysts supported on alumina and ceria/alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Rh/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Pt/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Pd/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ir/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ru/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ni/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ce/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Rh/Ce/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Pt/Ce/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Pd/Ce/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ir/Ce/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ru/Ce/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Ni/Ce/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957650912464624">38</xref></sup> on the hydrogen production by the steam reforming of glycerol. According to their results, the highest value of hydrogen selectivity and glycerol conversion under the specified reaction conditions were obtained with Ni/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Rh/CeO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. By using these catalysts under reaction conditions of 9:1 WGMR, 900 °C, and 0.15 mL/min feed flow rate, 80% and 71% hydrogen selectivity, respectively, were obtained. Moreover, in a comparative study between thermodynamic and experimental analyses of hydrogen production by steam reforming of glycerol, Adhikari et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957650912464624">27</xref></sup> found that the maximum moles of hydrogen produced thermodynamically per one mole of glycerol is 6, which is one mole less than the stoichiometric limit of 7. However, the experimental results conducted over a Ni/MgO catalyst were far from thermodynamic equilibrium. This study showed the necessity of finding an efficient catalyst for hydrogen production.</p>
<p>Unlike their previous studies, which were mainly focused on finding the best catalysts and conditions for the reforming process, Adhikari et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0957650912464624">42</xref></sup> studied the kinetics and reactor modelling of hydrogen production over Ni/CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts. For this process, they found that the activation energy and the reaction order were 103.4 KJ/mol and 0.233, respectively. Czernik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0957650912464624">69</xref></sup> performed glycerol steam reforming over a commercial Ni-based catalyst in a fluidised-bed reactor to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen yields for their experiments approached 80% of the theoretically possible yield for stoichiometric conversion. Hirari et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957650912464624">47</xref></sup> investigated the production of hydrogen by steam reforming of glycerol over a ruthenium catalyst. They stated that the use of Ru/Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a reforming catalyst resulted in a complete conversion of glycerol with a hydrogen selectivity of 90% at 600 °C. The steam reforming of glycerol over ceria-supported Ir, Co and Ni catalysts for hydrogen production has been studied by Zhang and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0957650912464624">46</xref></sup> They reported that the Ir/CeO<sub>2</sub> catalyst was significantly more active and selective toward hydrogen production than other catalysts used in their study. A complete glycerol conversion with more than 85% hydrogen selectivity was obtained at 400 °C using Ir/CeO<sub>2</sub>, whereas the total conversion of glycerol was obtained at 425 and 450 °C over Co/CeO<sub>2</sub> and Ni/CeO<sub>2</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p>Slinn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0957650912464624">70</xref></sup> performed steam reforming of glycerol by-product using Pt/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts. They found that the optimum reformer conditions for hydrogen production were a temperature of 880 °C, a flow rate of 0.12 mol glycerol/min per kg catalyst and a S/C ratio of 2.5. Hydrogen production from glycerol over nickel catalysts supported on alumina and modified by Mg, Zr, Ce or La was investigated by Iriondo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912464624">3</xref></sup> In this study, the authors determined that the use of such promoters enhances the hydrogen selectivity. Over the Ni/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst used in the experiment, the conversion of glycerol remained constant at 100% with a reaction time of more 50 hours. The high surface concentration of the catalyst in the presence of a Mg promoter contributes to an enhancement of the hydrogen selectivity, whereas the presence of Zr in the catalyst increases the capacity to activate steam. Furthermore, the high stability of the nickel phase under the experimental reaction conditions is due to the presence of Ce and La. In another study by Iriondo et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0957650912464624">43</xref></sup> the performance of monometallic (Ni and Pt) and bimetallic (Pt–Ni) catalysts as well as the effect of a lanthana-modified alumina support on the glycerol steam reforming process have been investigated. The authors found that the addition of lanthana to the alumina support improves the activity of the nickel catalysts and that the best hydrogen selectivity was obtained when the alumina-supported Ni catalysts were modified with an intermediate amount of lanthana. The effect of nickel catalysts supported on commercial α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> modified by the addition of ZrO<sub>2</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub> on the reforming process efficiency has been investigated by Buffoni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912464624">9</xref></sup> Their experimental work showed that the use of Ni/CeO<sub>2</sub>/α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> makes the reforming process more stable. This stability is due to the effect of Ce in inhibiting secondary dehydration reactions, which are responsible for catalyst deactivation by the formation of coke on its surface.</p>
<p>Profeti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0957650912464624">44</xref></sup> performed steam reforming of glycerol over Ni/CeO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts promoted with noble metals. They concluded that the formation of inactive nickel aluminate was prevented by the presence of CeO<sub>2</sub> dispersed on alumina. They also reported that the Ni sites remained stable in the reduced state during the reforming reaction when the noble metal was added to the catalyst, which can be observed in a complete conversion of glycerol at 700 °C over NiPd and NiPt catalysts.

At the beginning of the reforming process, the glycerol conversion was 96.8% and 99.4% at 600 °C–700 °C, respectively, and hydrogen selectivity was 99.7% at 650 °C. Over time, the conversion decreased significantly at 600 °C, whereas the hydrogen selectivity did not change with temperature.</p>
<p>All of the previously discussed studies lead to the conclusion that the reforming catalysts play an important role towards a complete conversion of glycerol as well as a higher selectivity of hydrogen produced. Deactivation of these catalysts by coke formation is the main problem that should be considered by researchers. Nickel-based catalysts are the most active and inexpensive catalysts used in glycerol steam reforming. Furthermore, operating conditions, including the temperature, the pressure, and the water/glycerol feed ratio, significantly affect the process efficiency. The conditions of 500 °C–700 °C, 1 bar and 6–9:1 water/glycerol molar ratio appear to be the favoured conditions.</p>

<p>In this process, oxygen combined with a fuel creates incomplete combustion, where only part of the fuel is oxidised by the addition of an insufficient stoichiometric amount of oxygen. Because these reactions are extremely fast and exothermic, a large quantity of heat is released. The heat generated is used to heat the mixture. As a result, no external heat is required to drive the reactions in a partial oxidation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0957650912464624">60</xref></sup> The advantages of partial oxidation over steam reforming include partial oxidation having a short start-up time because of the fast exothermic reaction and the reaction set-up being comparatively compact because it uses the heat generated from the exothermic reaction to vapourise fuel. The primary disadvantage of partial oxidation is that the catalyst temperature is difficult to control because of the heat generated during the process. Moreover, the partial oxidation process is less efficient than steam and auto-thermal reforming because the partial oxidation reaction produces intermediate species that decrease the purity of the output stream. Another factor which negatively affects PO process is the significant formation of CO in the reformate stream.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957650912464624">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0957650912464624">60</xref></sup></p>

<p>Valliyappan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0957650912464624">80</xref></sup> performed steam gasification, which is similar to partial oxidation, of crude and pure glycerol with and without catalysts.

They also found that the presence of Ni/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> enhanced the total gas production significantly. In addition, the hydrogen concentration in the product stream was higher in crude glycerol, even though the total gas (L/g) was higher in pure glycerol. Glycerol oxidation experiments performed at different temperatures and with various C/O ratios over alumina-supported platinum catalyst have been conducted by Dauenhauer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912464624">11</xref></sup> Their study concluded that the hydrogen selectivity increased with an increase in the C/O ratio up to a certain level and then started decreasing again. They found that complete glycerol conversion with 65% hydrogen selectivity was obtained at a C/O ratio of 1.2 and at a temperature of 1055 °C. In a recent study performed by Rennard and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0957650912464624">81</xref></sup> on the catalytic partial oxidation of glycerol to syngas over noble-metal catalysts, the rhodium catalysts were reported to exhibit equilibrium selectivity towards syngas, whereas the platinum catalysts produced mainly non-equilibrium products. The authors also stated that the addition of water to glycerol enhanced the selectivity towards hydrogen. Furthermore, the maximum hydrogen production was observed at an S/C ratio of 2:3 over a Rh-Ce catalyst.</p>
<p>The advantages of the partial oxidation process are that lower energy is supplied than in steam reforming, where the heat generated by the reaction is used to increase the temperature of reactants; partial oxidation is also a highly efficient process with better practical applications. Nickel-, platinum- and rhodium-based catalysts are most commonly used in this process.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0957650912464624"><title>Autothermal reforming</title>
<p>Autothermal reforming is a combination of partial oxidation and the steam reforming process. In this process, fuel, water, and oxidant are fed together into a reactor. Because the catalyst controls the reaction pathways in autothermal reforming, the selection of an appropriate catalyst is essential to achieve a good conversion and high hydrogen selectivity. The advantage of this process lies in its heat integrity, where the combustion reaction supplies the energy required for the endothermic steam reforming reaction. In addition, the auto-thermal process has a shorter start-up time than steam reforming because the exothermic reaction occurs on the catalyst’s surface. However, more hot spots are created by the heat liberated from the partial oxidation reaction than can be absorbed by steam reforming, which strongly affects the catalyst’s activity. Additionally, this process exhibits a lower process efficiency than steam reforming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0957650912464624">60</xref></sup></p>

<p>Douette et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0957650912464624">82</xref></sup> have studied the possibility of producing hydrogen from glycerol by autothermal reforming. They determined the effects of operating parameters, such as the oxygen-to-carbon ratio, the steam-to-carbon ratio and the temperature, on the efficiency of the process. A hydrogen yield of 65% (4.5 mol out of a possible 7) of the maximum theoretical yield and 90% of that produced thermodynamically has been achieved by the reforming of reagent-grade glycerol, whereas 4.4 mol of the maximum 7 are produced under similar conditions when the substrate was crude glycerol. However, the coke formation and catalyst deactivation during crude glycerol reforming caused the reforming process to be terminated. The production of hydrogen by the autothermal reforming of glycerol over Pd/Ni/Cu/K catalysts supported on alumina under operating conditions of 550 °C–850 °C, S/C = 3.0, and O/C = 0.3 was reported by Swami and Abraham.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0957650912464624">51</xref></sup> According to their study, the autothermal steam reforming process produced a greater amount of hydrogen than was produced by the conventional steam reforming process.

This selectivity was near equilibrium when they used rhodium catalysts with the addition of ceria on an alumina washcoat layer. They also found that the addition of steam increased the hydrogen selectivity to 79%.</p>
<p>With regards to the mentioned studies, the autothermal reforming process has a good efficiency in terms of hydrogen production. Compared to the steam reforming process, autothermal reforming can produce a greater amount of hydrogen with lower energy consumed. Coke formation, which causes termination of the reforming process, is the main problem for this type of reforming. Addressing this issue by enhancing catalysts performance and stability is essential to make this process more efficient.</p>

Using the same process conditions, the performance of a palladium catalyst was four times better than that of a gold catalyst. They also stated that the system did not suffer from poisoning after extensive testing.</p>
<p>Another study on the photocatalytic reforming of ethanol and glycerol aqueous solutions over impregnated and embedded CuO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts to produce hydrogen was conducted by Gombac et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0957650912464624">99</xref></sup> They concluded that the embedded catalyst gives a higher hydrogen production rate than the impregnated catalyst. For this process, only a few studies have been reported. Because of its low cost and because it can be conducted at ambient temperatures, this process appears to be a good alternative for hydrogen production.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0957650912464624"><title>Comparison between reforming processes</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, many reforming processes have been used to produce hydrogen from glycerol on the laboratory scale. Different mechanisms and operating conditions were applied to each process. Moreover, to minimise the production cost, different catalysts and catalysts supports were implemented in these processes. In this context, because the supercritical and photo-catalytic reforming processes are new and have been investigated on a limited basis, the comparative study considered only steam reforming, partial oxidation, autothermal and aqueous-phase reforming. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0957650912464624">Table 5</xref> shows the characteristics of the reforming processes for hydrogen production.

<sec id="sec15-0957650912464624"><title>Conclusion and final remarks</title>
<p>The major challenge in producing hydrogen is how to develop an active, selective, and stable reforming system. Thus, different reforming processes, such as steam reforming, partial oxidation, autothermal, aqueous phase, supercritical water, and photo-catalyst reforming, have been established. In addition, different types of catalysts with different synthesis methods have been used. From the reviewed studies, steam reforming, the most popular method for hydrocarbons reformation, received the highest number of studies compared with the other reforming types. Photo-catalyst reforming seems to be a good alternative for hydrogen production due to its low process cost and capability to be conducted efficiently under ambient conditions. Nickel and noble metal catalysts, prepared by impregnation, are the most common catalysts used for the glycerol reforming process. The problem with nickel catalysts is coke formation, whereas the high cost of noble metals limited their use. Different oxide-supports have been used in glycerol reforming, but alumina is the most common and stable support. Operating conditions of the reforming process, catalyst synthesis techniques, mixed-oxide support, and mixed-metal catalysts are promising subjects for future research, so as to build up an active, selective, stable and low-cost reforming system.</p>

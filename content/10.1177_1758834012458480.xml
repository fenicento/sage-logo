<abstract>
<p>Despite the successful approval and extensive application of sorafenib, the prognosis for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. Fortunately, there have been renewed and continued interests and active research in developing other molecularly targeted agents in HCC during the past few years. While there is early evidence of antitumor activity of several agents in phase I/II studies, phase III efforts with a few targeted agents have failed, highlighting the challenges of new drug development in HCC. This review summarizes the current status of other molecularly targeted agents under development in advanced HCC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to present many challenges. First, it is the sixth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1758834012458480">Parkin <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>]. Second, most patients will present with the advanced stage of disease, defined as the presence of extrahepatic disease, vascular invasion, or the presence of disease-related symptoms. These patients will not benefit from curative treatment options including surgical resection, liver transplantation, or radiofrequency ablation. Third, despite the approval of sorafenib, based on phase III trials demonstrating overall survival benefits, and its extensive application in clinical practice during the past few years, it is increasingly clear that the benefits of sorafenib remain modest. More importantly, the mechanisms mediating the sorafenib-related benefits, toxicity and resistance remain elusive. Fourth, most patients with HCC have underlying cirrhosis, which would have an adverse impact on the overall survival of these patients and limit the number of patients who are potentially eligible for clinical trials. Nevertheless, we have witnessed an unparalleled time period of active drug development in HCC. Many molecularly targeted agents that inhibit different pathways of hepatocarcinogenesis are under various phases of clinical development and novel targets are being assessed in HCC. This review will attempt to summarize briefly the current status of other molecularly targeted agents under investigation in HCC.</p>

<title>Antiangiogenic agents</title>
<p>HCCs are vascular tumors and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1758834012458480">Messerini <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758834012458480">Miura <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1758834012458480">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1758834012458480">2000</xref>]. In contrast to the normal architecture of hepatic parenchyma, HCCs display marked vascular abnormalities. In addition, liver tumor vessels have an abnormal blood flow, deficient leukocyte rolling, and are excessively leaky. In turn, this leads to hypovascular areas and severe hypoxia and/or necrosis: all hallmarks of liver tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1758834012458480">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011b</xref>]. VEGF is one of the main inducers of liver tumor angiogenesis. High VEGF expression has been associated with inferior survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1758834012458480">Chao <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1758834012458480">Jeng <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1758834012458480">Poon <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>]. Inhibition of angiogenesis represents a potential therapeutic strategy in HCC and many antiangiogenic agents have entered clinical studies in HCC.</p>
<sec id="section3-1758834012458480">
<title>Sunitinib</title>
<p>Sunitinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including VEGFR1, VEGFR2, PDGFR-alpha/beta, c-KIT, FLT3, and RET kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1758834012458480">Arora and Scholar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1758834012458480">Mendel <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1758834012458480">Pawson, 2002</xref>]. The currently available data with sunitinib in HCC come from four single-arm phase II studies that used three different dose schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1758834012458480">Faivre <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1758834012458480">Hoda <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1758834012458480">Koeberle <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1758834012458480">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1758834012458480">Table 1</xref>). Zhu and colleagues performed a study in patients with advanced HCC using sunitinib at 37.5 mg orally once daily on a standard 4-weeks-on, 2-weeks-off regimen (6 weeks per cycle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1758834012458480">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS). Of the 34 patients enrolled, one patient had a partial response (PR) of 20 months duration and an additional 10 patients (38.5%) had stable disease (SD) of at least 12 weeks duration. The median PFS was 3.9 months and overall survival (OS) was 9.8 months. In another European/Asian phase II study, sunitinib was administered at 50 mg daily for 4 weeks every 6 weeks to patients with unresectable HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1758834012458480">Faivre <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. The primary endpoint of the study was overall response rate per RECIST criteria. Of the 37 patients enrolled, one patient (2.7%) had a PR and 13 patients (35%) of patients had SD as best response. The median OS was 8.0 months and PFS 3.7 months. Koeberle and colleagues reported their experience with sunitinib using the 37.5 mg daily dosing schedule. Of the 45 patients enrolled, median PFS and OS were 1.5 and 9.3 months, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1758834012458480">Koeberle <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>].</p>

<p>The most common adverse events included hematologic toxicities, fatigue, and transaminase elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1758834012458480">Hoda <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1758834012458480">Koeberle <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1758834012458480">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. At the higher dose of 50 mg daily, sunitinib treatment led to more pronounced grade 3–4 toxicities and a higher death rate of 10% in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1758834012458480">Faivre <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>].</p>
<p>A randomized phase III study comparing sunitinib at 37.5 mg continuous daily dosing versus sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily in advanced HCC was conducted and timely completed. Unfortunately, in this large study of 1073 patients, sunitinib failed to demonstrate either superiority or noninferiority in OS when compared with sorafenib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1758834012458480">Table 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1758834012458480">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>].

<title>Brivanib</title>
<p>Brivanib alaninate is a dual inhibitor of VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathways that can induce tumor growth inhibition in mouse HCC xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1758834012458480">Huynh <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>]. A phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of brivanib in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HCC who had received either no prior systemic therapy (Cohort A, <italic>n</italic> = 55) or one prior regimen of angiogenesis inhibitor (Cohort B, <italic>n</italic> = 46) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1758834012458480">Table 3</xref>). The treatment schedule consisted of continuous daily dosing of brivanib at 800 mg. Both schedules reported preliminary evidence of antitumor activity. Median PFS and OS were 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–3.0) and 10 months (95% CI 6.8–15.2) in the first-line study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1758834012458480">Park <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. Median OS and time to progression (TTP) as assessed by study investigators following second-line treatment with brivanib were 9.79 and 2.7 months, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1758834012458480">Finn <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>]. Interestingly, greater than 50% decrease in serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) from baseline was seen in more than 40% of patients in both Cohorts A and B. the most common adverse events included fatigue, hypertension, nausea, and diarrhea. Most frequently observed grade 3–4 adverse events included fatigue (16%), aspartate transaminase (AST) elevation (19%), and hyponatremia (41%) in Cohort A and hypertension (7.3%), diarrhea (4.9%), and headache (4.9%) in Cohort B. Despite the ambitious phase III development program with brivanib in HCC, the recent press release reported that brivanib failed to demonstrate improved OS when compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC who failed sorafenib (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111222005831/en/BRISK-PS-Study-Investigational-Compound-Brivanib-Hepatocellular-Carcinoma">http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111222005831/en/BRISK-PS-Study-Investigational-Compound-Brivanib-Hepatocellular-Carcinoma</ext-link>).

<title>Linifanib (ABT-869)</title>
<p>Linifanib (ABT-869) is an orally active, potent, and selective inhibitor of VEGFR and PDGFR. Preliminary results from an open-label, multicenter phase II study of linifanib in advanced HCC were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1758834012458480">Toh <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. Linifanib was given at 0.25 mg/kg daily in Child-Pugh A or once every other day in Child-Pugh B patients until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the progression free rate at 16 weeks. Of the 44 patients enrolled, 34 were available for analyses (28 with Child A and 6 with Child B cirrhosis). The estimated response rate was 8.7% (95% CI 1.1–28) for the 23 patients with Child A cirrhosis. For all 34 patients, median TTP was 112 days (95% CI 110 to not available), median PFS was 112 days (95% CI 61–168), and median OS was 295 days (95% CI 182–333). The most common adverse events for all patients were hypertension (41%), fatigue (47%), diarrhea (38%), rash (35%), proteinuria (24%), vomiting (24%), cough (24%), and peripheral edema (24%). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were hypertension (20.6%) and fatigue (11.8%).

Two dosages of bevacizumab, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 2 weeks, were tested in patients with HCC with no overt extrahepatic metastases or invasion of major blood vessels. Of the 46 patients evaluable for efficacy, 6 (13%) had objective responses (95% CI 3–23%), and 65% were progression free at 6 months. Median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI 6.5–9.1 months) and median OS was 12.4 months (95% CI 9.4–19.9 months). Grade 3–4 adverse events included hypertension (15%) and thrombosis (6%, including 4% with arterial thrombosis). Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 11% of patients, including one fatal variceal bleed. Despite the initial encouraging results, there is no phase III development plan for bevacizumab.</p>

<title>Pazopanib (GW786034)</title>
<p>Pazopanib (GW786034) is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-Kit. Yau and colleagues reported a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of pazopanib in patients with locally unresectable and/or advanced HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1758834012458480">Yau <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. Doses of pazopanib were escalated from 200 to 800 mg once daily using a modified 3 + 3 design. Of the 28 Asian patients enrolled, MTD was determined to be 600 mg once daily. Diarrhea, skin hypopigmentation, and AST elevation were the most commonly reported adverse events at the MTD. A total of 19 patients (73%) had either partial response (PR) or SD. Changes in tumor DCE-MRI parameters were seen following pazopanib administration.</p>

<p>Two phase II clinical studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of erlotinib (Tarceva) given at 150 mg daily, in patients with advanced HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1758834012458480">Philip <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1758834012458480">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. In the study by Philip and colleagues, 3 out of 38 patients (9%) had PR and 12 patients (32%) were progression free at 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1758834012458480">Philip <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>]. Median OS was 13 months. In another report by Thomas and colleagues, 17 out of 40 patients (43%) achieved PFS at 16 weeks and the PFS rate at 24 weeks was 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1758834012458480">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. No PR or CR was observed in this study. The median time to failure, defined as either disease progression or death, was 13.3 weeks. The median time of OS was 25.0 weeks (95% CI 17.9–42.3 weeks) from the date of erlotinib therapy initiation. In an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group’s Study E1203, gefitinib given at 250 mg daily was examined in a single-arm phase II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1758834012458480">O’Dwyer <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. A two-stage design was used and 31 patients were accrued to the first stage. One patient had PR and seven patients had SD. The median PFS was 2.8 months (95% CI 1.5–3.9 months) and median OS was 6.5 months (95% CI 4.4–8.9 months). The criterion for second-stage accrual was not met and the authors concluded that gefitinib as a single agent was not active in advanced HCC. Lapatinib, a selective dual inhibitor of both EGFR and HER-2/NEU tyrosine kinases, also demonstrated modest activity in HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1758834012458480">Ramanathan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. Among the 40 patients with advanced HCC, the response rate was 5%, PFS 2.3 (95% CI 1.7–5.6) months, and OS of 6.2 (95% CI 5.1 to infinity) months. In another phase II study of 26 advanced HCC patients treated with lapatinib at 1500 mg daily, no responses were seen and median PFS of 1.9 months and OS of 12.6 months were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1758834012458480">Bekaii-Saab <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>].</p>

<title>Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR</title>
<p>Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against EGFR, was tested in two phase II studies in patients with advanced HCC.

The initial dose of cetuximab was 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given intravenously followed by weekly intravenous infusions at 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. No responses were seen. Five patients had SD (median time, 4.2 months; range, 2.8–4.2 months). The median overall survival was 9.6 months (95% CI 4.3–12.1 months) and the median PFS was 1.4 months (95% CI 1.2–2.6 months). Cetuximab trough concentrations were not notably altered in patients with Child A and Child B cirrhosis.

<p>Taken together, with the exception of erlotinib showing modest activity in single-arm studies, the other EGFR inhibitors have not demonstrated convincing antitumor activity as single agents.

<title>mTOR inhibitors</title>
<p>Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions to regulate protein translation, angiogenesis, and cell cycle progression in many cancers including HCC. Preclinical data have demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors were effective in inhibiting cell growth and tumor vascularity in HCC cell lines and HCC tumor models. The importance of the mTOR pathway in HCC was examined in a comprehensive study with 314 HCC and 37 nontumoral tissues using a series of molecular techniques to assess the mutation, DNA copy number changes, messenger RNA and gene expression, and protein activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1758834012458480">Villanueva <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>]. Aberrant mTOR signaling (p-RPS6) was present in half of the cases and chromosomal gains in RICTOR (25% of patients) and positive p-RPS6 staining correlated with HCC recurrence following resection.</p>
<p>A number of mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, temsirolimus and everolimus) are available clinically. Chen and colleagues reported their early experience of a randomized, phase I, and pharmacokinetic study of everolimus in advanced HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1758834012458480">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. Two different schedules were tested in this randomized phase I study: continuous daily dosing and once-weekly dosing. A total of 36 patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicities observed included hyperbilirubinemia, ALT elevation, thrombocytopenia, infection, diarrhea, and cardiac ischemia. The MTD for weekly and daily dosing schedules was determined to be 70 and 7.5 mg, respectively. Interestingly, reactivation of HBV and flaring of HCV was observed in four and one patients, respectively. The disease control rate of 31 evaluable patients was 61% (10/16) and 46.7% (7/15, including one partial response) of patients receiving daily and weekly treatment, respectively. Another phase I/II study evaluating everolimus using continuous daily dosing schedule in advanced HCC was reported. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Everolimus was well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC at either 5 or 10 mg daily dosing, and 25 patients, most of whom had prior systemic treatment, were treated at 10 mg/day in the phase II study. One patient (4%) had PR (95% CI 0.9–19.6%). The median PFS and OS were 3.8 months (95% CI 2.1–4.6) and 8.4 months (95% CI 3.9–21.1), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1758834012458480">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011a</xref>].</p>

In a press release, tivantinib reportedly met the primary endpoint of improving TTP in a randomized phase II study comparing tivantinib with placebo in previously treated patients. Cabozantinib (XL184), a dual c-Met/VEGFR2 inhibitor, also demonstrated early evidence of antitumor activity in a randomized discontinuation phase II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1758834012458480">Cohn <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>]. Of the 41 patients enrolled, efficacy and safety data were available for 34 patients. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events were hand–foot syndrome (15%), diarrhea (9%), and thrombocytopenia (9%). Three patients had confirmed PR. The overall disease control rate (DCR = PR+SD) at week 12 was 71%. The median PFS was 4.2 months.

<title>Other molecularly targeted agents under development in HCC</title>
<p>Many genetic and epigenetic changes occur during hepatocarcinogenesis. These pathways include the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, insulin growth factor (IGF) and its receptor (IGFR), as well as the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Multiple agents targeting these key pathways are under early stage evaluation in HCC. The major challenge for future development of these targeted agents is to assess early evidence of safety profiles and antitumor activity, validate potential target inhibition, and identify likely predictive markers for specific drugs so that the targeted population can be enriched.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite the successful development of sorafenib in HCC, there is continued need and opportunity for developing other targeted agents in HCC. Many molecularly targeted agents are at different stages of clinical development in HCC and some have failed in phase III studies. HCC is heterogeneous with various etiology and whether HCC with underlying HBV or HCV will respond differently to various targeted agents should be prospectively evaluated. Future research should continue to unravel the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis and to identify key relevant molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. While we are developing other antiangiogenic and targeted agents in HCC, it is imperative that we continue our efforts to identify and validate surrogate and predictive biomarkers that would be helpful to predict clinical efficacy, toxicity, and resistance to these agents. Hopefully we will continue to witness meaningful progress for the development of molecularly targeted agents in HCC in the coming years.</p>

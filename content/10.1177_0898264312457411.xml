<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As more people live into their 90s and beyond, our understanding of disability in activities of daily living (ADLs) in the oldest-old population will become more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264312457411">Jeune, 2002</xref>). Disability in ADLs has important public health implications. It is associated with increased health care demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312457411">Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski, &amp; Hiris, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264312457411">Stump, Johnson, &amp; Wolinsky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264312457411">Verbrugge &amp; Patrick, 1995</xref>), increased costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312457411">Chan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264312457411">Taylor, Schenkman, Zhou, &amp; Sloan, 2001</xref>) and an increase in risk of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312457411">Ostbye, Steenhuis, Wolfson, Walton, &amp; Hill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312457411">Ponzetto et al., 2003</xref>). One of the challenges facing clinicians, researchers, and policy makers is how to balance time and resources between the traditional medical-disease model and geriatric-specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312457411">Chan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312457411">Mor et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312457411">Ostbye et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264312457411">Stump et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264312457411">Verbrugge &amp; Patrick, 1995</xref>). In a patient or population aged 90 years and above, should there be a greater emphasis on one of these (traditional medical-disease model vs. geriatric-specific conditions), or are they equally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312457411">Hebert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312457411">Wolf, Mendes de Leon, &amp; Glass, 2007</xref>)?</p>
<p>Although many studies have shown that both medical diseases and geriatric conditions are related to functional disabilities in the young-old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312457411">Blaum, Ofsedal, &amp; Liang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312457411">Picavet &amp; Van den Bos, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312457411">Ponzetto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312457411">Stuck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312457411">Valderrama-Gama, Damian, Ruigomez, &amp; Martin-Moreno, 2002</xref>), this dual relationship seems to lean toward geriatric conditions as populations get beyond 80 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457411">Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457411">Cesari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312457411">Dunlop, Manheim, Sohn, Liu, &amp; Chang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312457411">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312457411">Nybo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312457411">Ozaki, Uchiyama, Tagaya, Ohida, &amp; Ogihara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312457411">Ravaglia et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312457411">Takayama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312457411">Woo, Ho, Yu, Lau, &amp; Yuen, 1998</xref>). In two studies of octogenarians, many medical diagnoses (heart disease, osteoarthritis, lung disease, and cancer) were not associated with ADL disability, but dementia was a significant predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312457411">Dunlop et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312457411">Woo et al., 1998</xref>). A few studies on populations aged ≥90 years did not include medical diseases or showed that most were not associated with ADL disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457411">Cesari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312457411">Nybo et al., 2001</xref>). In two centenarian studies, almost all medical diseases failed to be associated with ADL disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312457411">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312457411">Ravaglia et al., 1997</xref>). Despite these data that are mostly from developed countries, studies using data from developing countries such as China, where personal resources are often lacking, are needed to clarify this relationship.</p>
<p>Although there are several reasons for the tendency past studies to move away from focusing on medical disease toward focusing on geriatric conditions (such as survival bias), one limitation of previous studies is the use of self-reported medical diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312457411">Takayama et al., 2007</xref>). The use of objective biomedical measures (such as blood pressure, body mass index [BMI], and laboratory measurements) may improve identification of undiagnosed or subclinical medical diseases.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to (a) investigate the relationship of ADL disability with self-reported medical diseases and geriatric conditions among a group of nonagenarians and centenarians, and (b) determine whether biomedical measures are associated with ADL disability. Our hypotheses are as follows:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0898264312457411">
<title>Location, Sampling, and Recruitment of Participants</title>
<p>The present study was a secondary data analysis of a population-based observational study called the Project of Longevity and Aging in Dujiangyan (PLAD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312457411">Lu et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312457411">2009</xref>). Dujiangyan is a county-level city 30 kilometers from the capital of Sichuan province Chengdu. The city government invited researchers from the Department of Geriatrics at Sichuan University to investigate the long-lived citizens of this area because Dujiangyan had been named by the Sichuan provincial government of China as a native longevity place. The total number of citizens in Dujiangyan aged ≥90 years in 2005 was 1,401 people, accounting for 0.23% of the total population of Dujiangyan (approximately 621,980). The proportion of persons aged ≥90 years for all of China (2004 data) was 0.11% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312457411"><italic>China Statistics</italic>, 2005</xref>). During the summer of 2005, in conjunction with government officials and the population registry, 62.1% (870/1,401) of the population aged ≥90 years were recruited. Data on the Dujiangyan population who were not recruited were not available.</p>
<p>Reliability of age reporting is an important factor in studies of the oldest old. Ages (dates of birth) in the study are felt to be accurate for the following reasons: (a) Previous studies suggest age reporting is relatively good in countries where date of birth has long-standing astrological significance, as is the case among Han Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312457411">Coale &amp; Li, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264312457411">Wang, Zeng, Jeune, &amp; Vaupel, 1998</xref>). This method was used in the current study. (b) The current population had no ethnic minority groups (in which there may be age exaggeration; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312457411">Coale &amp; Li, 1991</xref>). (c) Age was verified during the interview with family members. (d) The participants were recruited from the Dujiangyan City government, which keeps records of the household registration. The household registration system started in China in the early 1950s and is the basis for the household registration booklet. It contains the age of members of the household and can be used to confirm age when people apply to a school or take a new job. It is also used to confirm age for the “certificate of old age,” which grants older people certain benefits (when traveling or visiting museums, for example). This has been shown to be a reliable method of age verification in a study that assessed dates of birth of centenarians from Hangzhou, Beijing, and Chengdu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264312457411">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). Chengdu is approximately 30 kilometers from Dujiangyan.</p>
<p>Another method of evaluating reliability of age reporting is to examine age distribution of centenarians, as was done in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), one of the most comprehensive and nationally representative studies of the oldest old in China (age range: 80-105 years; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312457411">Zeng &amp; Gu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264312457411">Zeng, Vaupel, Xiao, Zhang, &amp; Liu, 2001</xref>). Since single-year age-specific mortality rates are approximately 40% to 50% at age ≥100 years, it is expected that accurate age reporting among a certain cross-sectional centenarian population would result in approximately half the number of people in each successive year of age. In this study, the number of women, at ages 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, and 108 were 13, 13, 9, 2, 8, 5, 2, 0, and 1, respectively. The number of men in this study, at ages 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and 105, were 5, 5, 1, 3, 1, and 1, respectively. Thus, the reliability of the age distribution of the current study according to this method was not as reliable as that in the CLHLS.</p>
<p>Face-to-face interview questionnaires were administered by trained researchers to collect self-reported health information and perform certain physical and geriatric assessments. The questionnaire was based on studies from the United States, Canada, and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312457411">Canadian Study of Health and Aging Working Group, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312457411">Fillenbaum &amp; Smyer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312457411">Team for Research on Healthy Longevity of the Oldest Old in China, 2000</xref>). The variables used in this study included sociodemographics, self-reported ADLs, self-reported medical diseases, and either measured or self-reported geriatric conditions. More than 95% of participants were accompanied by family members who served as proxies with the face-to-face interviews when necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898264312457411">
<title>ADL Disability</title>
<p>Functional status was measured using the scale validated by Lawton and Brody in 1969 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312457411">Lawton &amp; Brody, 1969</xref>). This scale consists of 14 items pertaining to functional disability in both basic ADLs and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The basic ADL scale validated by Lawton and Brody was referred to as the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) in their original study, but for the purpose of this article, we will use the more accepted term of ADL.</p>
<p>The current study was limited to basic ADLs in the Dujiangyan population because a large percentage of participants had never performed several of the IADLs queried about. The Lawton and Brody scale includes the following six ADLs: eating, dressing, grooming, walking, bathing, and toileting. When participants (or their family members when necessary) were queried about ADLs, they were given the following choices: “can do,” “some difficulty but can do,” “need some help,” or “cannot do on their own.” For our analyses, impairment was defined as “need some help” or “cannot do on their own.” ADL disability (dichotomized variable) was defined as impairment in one or more of these six basic ADLs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898264312457411">
<title>Sociodemographic Variables</title>
<p>Sociodemographic factors included age, gender, education, and main occupation before 60 years of age. Education was dichotomized as “any education” or “no education” since none of the participants in the Dujiangyan population had an educational level above middle school. The main occupation before 60 years was categorized into two groups: farmers and nonfarmers.</p>
<p>Other social factors included whether participants were or were not current tea drinkers, current alcohol drinkers, or current smokers. Participants were asked whether they practiced any religion and this was dichotomized as <italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic>. Self-rated health was asked about using a standard, “How would you rate your health: very good, good, fair, bad or very bad?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898264312457411">
<title>Medical Diseases</title>
<p>Information on medical diseases was collected by asking participants or caregivers using the following question: “Have doctors ever told you that you have had any of the following diseases or health problems in the past year?” The 10 medical diseases examined in this study include hypertension, heart disease or heart problems, cerebrovascular diseases or stroke, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, respiratory problems, gastrointestinal problems, osteoarthritis, chronic kidney disease, and cancer (excluding skin cancer). Respiratory problems included asthma, pneumonia, tuberculosis, emphysema, bronchitis, and breathing problems.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, comorbidities (defined as having multiple medical diseases) were limited to the 10 medical diseases listed above. Number of hospitalizations in the past year was also asked about. This was added as a variable in the analyses as a potential measure of severity of medical diseases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898264312457411">
<title>Geriatric Conditions</title>
<p>The term <italic>geriatric condition</italic> was used to indicate a symptom or sign common in older adults but not necessarily related to specific diseases. The term <italic>condition</italic> was also used instead of geriatric syndrome to avoid ambiguity with the term <italic>syndrome</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312457411">American Geriatrics Society, 2005</xref>). The geriatric conditions for the analyses were chosen based on availability from the database and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312457411">Cigolle, Langa, Kabeto, Tian, &amp; Blaum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264312457411">Juster &amp; Suzman, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The seven geriatric-oriented conditions included hearing problems (per participant or according to accompanying family member), vision problems (eye troubles not relieved by glasses), fall (in the past year), fracture (any kind of fracture), weight loss (≥1 kilogram in the past month), loss of appetite, and cognitive impairment. Cognitive function was measured using a Chinese version of the 30-item Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312457411">Ng, Niti, Chiam, &amp; Kua, 2007</xref>). Since none of the participants in the Dujiangyan population had an educational level above middle school, a cutoff score lower than 18 was used to define cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312457411">Katzman et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898264312457411">
<title>Blood Pressure and Common Laboratory Measurements</title>
<p>Blood pressure was measured in a standard fashion. After a 10-min rest in a quiet room, blood pressure was measured twice (interval of 10 min). Measurements were recorded to the nearest 2 mm Hg using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer by qualified nurses or physicians. The mean of two readings was recorded. For the purpose of the analyses, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were considered elevated if &gt;159 mm/Hg and &gt;89 mm/Hg, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264312457411">Beckett et al., 2008</xref>). Body mass index (BMI) was based on measuring the participants’ weight and height and was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. It was considered low if it was &lt;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264312457411">WHO Expert Consultation, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Venous blood samples were collected after an overnight fast for measurement of plasma glucose, serum creatinine, albumin, hemoglobin, and lipids. These were determined by standard laboratory techniques, performed by technicians in the biochemistry laboratory of Sichuan University. The following values were chosen to be abnormal as follows: fasting plasma glucose &gt;100 mg/dL, creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 20 mL/s calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation based on serum creatinine, albumin &lt; 4.0 g/L, hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 mg/L, total cholesterol &gt;200 mg/dL, LDL &gt;130 mg/dL, HDL &lt; 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL. A more strict cutpoint of CrCl (&lt;20 mL/s) was chosen instead of 30 mL/s because such a large percentage of participants had CrCl &lt; 30 mL/s. A hemoglobin cutpoint of &lt; 10 mg/L was used to identify people for whom anemia might have some clinical consequence of a low hemoglobin and to encompass both genders.</p>

<title>Completeness of Data</title>
<p>The maximum percent of missing data points for variables in the sociodemographics category was 1.2%, except for self-rated health, which was 7.7%. For the medical diagnosis and geriatric conditions categories (not including cognitive impairment), the maximum percent of missing data points was 3.2%. For cognitive impairment, 12.3% of participants did not have a completed MMSE. Since this was higher than most other data in this category, a dummy variable, “cognition unknown” was created for the analyses.</p>
<p>For blood pressure measurements, maximum percent of missing data points was 5.4% and for BMI, it was 9.9%. The percent of missing lab measurements ranged from 7.0% to 12.1%.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264312457411">Table 1</xref> are means (+ standard deviation) or valid percentages. The data were first analyzed by undertaking a bivariate logistic regression with ADL disability as the dependent variable to obtain unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All variables were treated as dichotomous variables except the following: age, comorbidities, and hospitalizations. These three variables were analyzed as both linear and dichotomous in the bivariate analyses to be more descriptive. In the multivariate analyses, these were entered into the analyses as linear variables in order to retain as much information as possible.</p>

<p>The mean age of the 870 participants was 94 years (range 90-108 years) and 68% of the participants were female (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264312457411">Table 1</xref> for other characteristics). Overall, 572 (66.1%) of participants were independent in all ADLs. Among men, according to age subgroups of 90 to 94, 95 to 99, and ≥100 years, 78.1%, 68.6%, and 68.8%, respectively, were ADL independent. Among women, according to age subgroups of 90 to 94, 95 to 99, and ≥100 years, 65.4%, 59.4%, and 37.5% were ADL independent. The following percent of the population were independent in the individual ADLs: eating (97.1%), dressing (95.5%), grooming (94.1%), toileting (93.4%), bathing (79.1%), walking (76.8%).</p>

<title>Distributions of Medical Diseases and Geriatric Conditions</title>
<p>The most prevalent medical diseases were osteoarthritis (29.4%), gastrointestinal problems (17.7%), and respiratory problems (14.1%). The remaining medical diseases were all less than 10% prevalent: hypertension (9.7%) and heart problems (4.5%), chronic kidney disease (2.3%), cerebrovascular disease (2.0%), cancer (1.1%), and diabetes (1.0%). Overall, 42.4% reported no medical diseases, and 57.6% reported one or more and 20.0% reported two or more. More than half of the participants had not been hospitalized in the past 1 year, with 24.4% having one hospitalization and 21% having two or more hospitalizations. The most prevalent geriatric conditions were hearing problems (54.9%), falls (52.3%), cognitive impairment (50%), and vision problems (43.7% see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264312457411">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0898264312457411">
<title>Biomedical Measurements</title>
<p>Although less than 10% of participants reported hypertension on the interview, 23.4% had a systolic blood pressure &gt;159 mmHg, and 13.6% had a diastolic blood pressure &gt;89 mmHg. Similarly, although a very small percentage of participants reported diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 15.0% had fasting glucose &gt;100 mg/dL and 15.9% had a calculated CrCl clearance &lt; 20 mL/s. Almost 40% of participants had a BMI &lt; 18 kg/m2, but only 12.4% had albumin &lt; 4.0 g/L. Anemia was not queried in the interview, but 16.3% had hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 mg/L. Lipid profiles on the group revealed small percentages of participants with laboratory values outside the acceptable range (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264312457411">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Two geriatric conditions remained significantly associated with ADL disability: cognitive impairment, and having had a fracture.</p>
<p>In Model 2, when objective biomedical measurements were added to Model 1, the same four variables were associated with ADL disability as in Model 1: age, having been a farmer, and the geriatric conditions of cognitive impairment and having had a fracture. In addition, respiratory disease and fasting serum glucose &gt;100 mg/dL were also associated with ADL disability. None of the other biomedical measurements were associated with ADL disability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study of nonagenarians and centenarians was to investigate the relationship of ADL disability with self-reported medical diseases and certain geriatric conditions. Two geriatric conditions were significantly associated with ADL disability in three of four multivariate models: cognitive impairment and fracture. Dementia has been found to be associated with ADL disability in previous studies of people older than 80 years of age, and studies of people aged more than 90 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457411">Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457411">Cesari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312457411">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>). Similar population studies that have queried about fracture have found it to be associated with ADL disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457411">Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312457411">Takayama et al., 2007</xref>). Previous research and conceptual schemes of the disablement process are helpful in explaining why dementia and fracture might lead to loss of ADL function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312457411">Jette, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264312457411">Pope &amp; Tarlov, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264312457411">Verbrugge &amp; Jette, 1994</xref>). Using dementia as an example, the main pathway in the disablement process starts with active pathology or disease (neurofibrillary plaques and tangles), which leads to impairment (of memory or executive function), which in turn leads to functional limitations (limitation or slowing down in performing some ADLs) that finally results in inability to fully perform a socially defined task (inability to maintain continence or ambulate without assistance). A similar pathway can be mapped out for fracture if one views fracture as a result of osteoporosis, an age-related “pathology” of the bone.</p>
<p>Only one medical disease, respiratory disease, was found to be associated with ADL disability. This has not been found in previous studies of oldest-old adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457411">Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457411">Cesari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312457411">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>). Rather than try to explain why respiratory disease might be associated with ADL disability in our study compared to others, it might be more important to examine whether the finding that other diseases analyzed in our survey were <italic>not</italic> associated with ADL disability is consistent with other studies. Although studies of young-old populations have found several different diseases are associated with ADL disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312457411">Blaum et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312457411">Dunlop et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312457411">Picavet &amp; Van den Bos, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312457411">Stuck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312457411">Vaalderrama-Gama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312457411">Woo et al., 1998</xref>), this is not the case when looking at data from studies of oldest-old adults. In the IlSIRENTE study (peopled aged ≥80 years), five of nine medical diseases (coronary heart disease, lung disease, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and cancer) were not associated with ADL scale score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457411">Cesari et al., 2006</xref>). In the Leiden 85+ study, only stroke and Parkinson’s disease were associated with ADL disability, but myocardial infarction, obstructive lung disease, osteoarthritis, and diabetes were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457411">Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2005</xref>). In the NonaSantfeliu study (people aged ≥90 years), none of the six medical diseases queried were associated with functional decline over 2 years. In a study of centenarians in Tokyo (<italic>n</italic> = 302), of five medical diseases analyzed (stroke, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer) and one geriatric condition (fracture), the Barthel Index was significantly lower only for participants with stroke and fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312457411">Takayama et al., 2007</xref>). Of note, the prevalence of most of these was higher than that found in our study: stroke (29%), heart disease (16%), diabetes (6%), cancer (10%), and fracture (46%). In a different study of Japanese centenarians, although a list of medical diseases was not queried, having a present illness had no relationship with independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312457411">Ozaki et al., 2007</xref>). Possible explanations for this lack of association between medical diseases and ADL disability include survival bias (those with serious medical diseases have died at an earlier age), selection bias (those with more serious medical diseases are not included in the studies), and the possibility that geriatric conditions have more of an effect on function at a very old age than do medical diseases. It is also possible that among the participants, there were undiagnosed or underdiagnosed medical diseases due to lower levels of medical facilities and medical technology than might be found in urban areas.</p>
<p>Another potential explanation for lack of an association with <italic>individual</italic> diseases or geriatric conditions and ADL disability is that this relationship does not account for frailty. Frailty may be defined as a state of vulnerability to stressors due to decreased physiological reserves. Frailty captures deficits (physical and cognitive) that accumulate over a person’s lifetime and may be more indicative of outcomes such as ADL disability than individual diseases. Two common approaches in aging research are the phenotypic approach (defining frailty on several items with a cutoff of having a certain number of items to qualify as frail) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312457411">Fried et al., 2001</xref>) and the frailty index (often calculated as the number of health deficiencies divided by the total number of possible deficits for a given person; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312457411">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312457411">Kulminski, Ukraintseva, Akushevich, Arbeev, &amp; Yashin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An additional finding from this study is that an increase in number of comorbidities was not associated with ADL disability. This is contrary to many studies of young-old populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312457411">Blaum et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312457411">Dunlop et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312457411">Picavet &amp; Van den Bos, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312457411">Stuck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312457411">Valderrama-Gama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312457411">Woo et al., 1998</xref>). The data from studies of people older than 80 years of age are mixed. In the IlSIRENTE study, having three or more comorbidities was associated with ADL scale score in the unadjusted analysis but not the adjusted analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457411">Cesari et al., 2006</xref>). In the Leiden 85+ study, one or more, and two or more diseases were associated with ADL disability in the low-income group, but only two or more diseases were associated with ADL disability in the high-income group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457411">Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2005</xref>). The NonaSantfeliu study (aged ≥90 years) showed that comorbidity score (using the Charlson Index) was associated with ADL disability in the bivariate analysis but not in the multivariate analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312457411">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>). In a Dutch study of centenarians, mean number of comorbidities were equivalent among autonomous (functioning well, living at home, nondemented), and nonautonomous participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312457411">Andersen-Ranberg, Schroll, &amp; Jeune, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The second purpose of this study was to determine whether objective measures are associated with ADL disability. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses (Models 2 and 4) only one of them remained significantly associated with ADL disability (fasting glucose &gt;100 mg/dL). A possible explanation for this finding is that participants may have had undiagnosed diabetes. Diabetes has been considered to accelerate the aging process and has been associated with ADL disability in some population studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312457411">Andrade, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264312457411">Kalyani, Saudek, Brancati, &amp; Selvin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312457411">Morley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that all of the other objective biomedical measurements were not associated with ADL disability suggests that although they can improve identification of undiagnosed or underdiagnosed individuals, they may not add to the risk profile for ADL disability of oldest-old adults. This may have implications for developing countries, where populations of the oldest old will continue to grow in this century. If access to objective medicals tests is limited, but access to medical practitioners is not, then capturing information on self-reported medical diseases (“told by my doctor or practitioner”) and geriatric conditions (which can be assessed with a geriatric assessment questionnaire) may still help in identifying risks for ADL disability.</p>
<p>Age, not surprisingly, was found in all multivariate models, to be associated with ADL disability. The other sociodemographic item that remained significant (protective) in all multivariate models was having been a farmer. This finding should be viewed with caution since almost 80% of participants were farmers, so other occupations had to be collapsed into “not farmer,” which did not allow us to analyze what was different about being a farmer compared to one not being a farmer, that is, “not farmer.” However, this result could suggest that higher level of physical activity is associated with maintaining ADL abilities, as has been shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312457411">Balzi et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This study has several limitations, the most important of which is related to ADL reporting. Compared to previous studies, the percentage of participants in our study who were ADL independent was higher than expected, especially among men aged ≥100 years. In the first of three waves in the CLHLS, (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 9,000 sample size), the percentages of <italic>rural</italic> participants who were ADL independent, according to age subgroups 90 to 94, 95 to 99, and 100 to 105 years, were 76%, 66%, and 49% for men, and 66%, 54%, and 38% for women, respectively. The percentages among <italic>urban</italic> participants, according to age subgroups 90 to 94, 95 to 99, and 100 to 105 years, were 65%, 54%, and 38% for men and 54%, 41%, and 28% for women, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0898264312457411">Zeng, Liu, &amp; George, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264312457411">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>). In a study of more than 2,000 Danes aged 92 to 93 years, 50% of men and 41% of women were independent in all ADLs on a five-item ADL index (bathing, dressing, toileting, transfer, feeding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312457411">Nybo et al., 2001</xref>). There are several possible reasons for a higher-than-expected ADL independence in our study. Some participants may have overestimated their ability to do ADLs, especially among men aged ≥100 years. It is also possible that our study population was more ADL independent than the <italic>total</italic> age-matched population in Dujiangyan, creating some bias. Last, since Dujiangyan is considered closer to a rural population than urban, it might be, as Zeng and colleagues have suggested, that the oldest-old living in rural China “remain active” (maintain their ADL independence) compared to those in urban areas for several reasons: harder life and higher mortality at younger ages resulting in a selected more robust oldest-old population, facilities are less likely to be available in rural areas forcing oldest old to perform ADLs themselves, and the frequency with which ADLs are carried out may be higher in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264312457411">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Another limitation to our study is the possibility that people not represented in the study had significant comorbidities. If this was the case, some medical illnesses and comorbidities might have been associated with ADL disability.</p>
<p>Another limitation has to do with age reporting. As noted in the Method section, there are several reasons to believe that age reporting was reliable. However, the age distribution of centenarians was not as good as in the CLHLS. Although this suggests age exaggeration by participants, other possible explanations might be that not all centenarians in the region were included, which could have given a better distribution, or the population sample was too small to give an accurate distribution. Also note from our Method section, the “density” of those aged ≥90 years in Dujiangyan was higher (0.23%) than the rest of China (0.11%).</p>
<p>This study has several strengths as well as other limitations. The addition of objective measures, especially laboratory values, added another component to the study that not all population studies utilize. On the other hand, our population was smaller than large epidemiological studies. The objective measurements were quite basic but included common lab values that physicians and other practitioners would order on a routine basis. However, they did not include more detailed tests of cardiovascular health (such as cardiac echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, or carotid ultrasound; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312457411">Fried et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The capture rate of this population was 62%, quite acceptable for a population study of the oldest-old adults, and all participants were from one region. A Danish study of nonagenarians and the NonaSantfeliu study in Spain had capture rates of 63% and 61%, respectively. A higher rate would have added strength to the generalizability of our results.</p>
<p>This study was cross-sectional. This limitation especially pertains to the issue of survival bias. Our population had very low percentages of certain medical diseases, which suggests those in this age cohort who had common diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes, died before reaching the age of 90 years.</p>
<p>The list of self-reported medical diseases was as extensive as in other studies of the oldest olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312457411">Andersen-Ranberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457411">Bootsma-van der Wiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457411">Cesari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312457411">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312457411">Nybo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312457411">Ozaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312457411">Ravaglia et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312457411">Takayama et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, not all geriatric syndromes were queried. Specific questions about urinary incontinence and an assessment for depression would have added to the study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study of Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians, cognitive impairment and fracture were associated with ADL disability. This study also showed that the only objective measurement to retain significance in the multivariate models was fasting glucose &gt;100 mg/dL. These findings need to be viewed bearing in mind the limitations of an observational study of an oldest-old adult population and in light of the potential mechanisms of the disablement process as discussed above. As the population of oldest-old adults continues to increase in numbers around the world, further studies are needed to delineate the impact that geriatric conditions compared to medical diseases have on ADL disability and whether or not the addition of objective measurements such as blood tests will add to this knowledge.</p>

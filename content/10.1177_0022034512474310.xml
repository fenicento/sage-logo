<abstract>
<p>Functional monomers in dentin adhesives are involved in wetting dental substrates, demineralization, and the formation of calcium salts. However, the interaction of these monomers with collagen is not understood at a molecular/atomic level. We performed saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy to investigate the binding interaction of 2 functional monomers, 4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride (4-META) and 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogenphosphate (MDP), with atelocollagen as a triple-helical peptide model. High STD intensities were detected on the protons in the aliphatic region in MDP, whereas they were not detected for 4-META. The STD results imply that MDP has a relatively stable interaction with the collagen, because of the hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic MDP moieties and the hydrophobic collagen surface. This finding indicates that MDP-collagen complexation accounts for stable dentin bonding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental adhesion technology has progressed rapidly and achieved improved bond strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512474310">Pashley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512474310">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The adhesive monomers penetrate demineralized dentin surfaces and create a molecular-level hybrid of adhesive polymers and dental tissues. This structure is called the hybrid layer, which is composed of demineralized dentin matrix reinforced by polymer networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512474310">Nakabayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The introduction of amphiphilic functional monomers in solvents such as water, acetone, or alcohol, is responsible for improved bonding efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512474310">Van Landuyt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The hydrophilic properties of the functional monomers are important for wetting and demineralizing dentin, which is essential for adequate dentin adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512474310">Vaidyanathan and Vaidyanathan, 2009</xref>). The most common functional monomers used in commercial dental adhesives are a phosphate and a carboxylic acid analogue. The phosphate and carboxylic acid groups dissociate to release protons in aqueous solutions, which contribute to demineralization when applied to the enamel or dentin surface. The chemical properties of functional monomers are thought to account for the high bond strength with dentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512474310">Van Landuyt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For the monomer interaction to be understood, the reactions of the monomers with the tooth component must be investigated at the molecular/atomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512474310">Nishiyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512474310">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512474310">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512474310">Fukegawa <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> used a magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique to demonstrate that functional monomers in some self-etch systems may establish chemical bonds between specific carboxyl or phosphate groups of functional monomers and residual hydroxyapatite crystals. The specific chemical interaction of the functional monomers with residual hydroxyapatite and the low dissolution rate of its calcium salt determined the bonding efficacy and stability. They proposed that the resulting calcium salts and the monomers may be present on the dentin collagen scaffold. Thus, the functional monomers in dentin adhesives are involved in wetting dental substrates, demineralization, and in the formation of calcium salts.</p>
<p>However, the interaction of functional monomers with residual organic components, such as the collagen fibrils, is not fully understood. The interaction with collagen is the most important, because the deterioration of collagen fibrils within the hybrid layer compromises the long-term stability of dentin bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474310">Donmez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512474310">Breschi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512474310">Bertassoni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Thus, the micromechanical performance and molecular-level interactions of functional monomers with collagen fibrils should play an important role in the subsequence adhesion process and bond durability.</p>
<p>Saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a promising method for obtaining atomic-level information about the interaction between functional monomers and collagen. This method has been widely used in drug delivery studies for screening ligands for their binding to proteins and to determine the ligand-binding epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512474310">Mayer and Meyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512474310">Meyer and Peters, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474310">Murata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512474310">2005</xref>). STD involves selective saturation of a resonance that belongs to the protein receptor. If a ligand binds, the saturation propagates from the selected receptor protons to other protons in the receptor <italic>via</italic> spin diffusion. The saturation is then transferred to the binding component by cross-relaxation at the ligand-receptor interface. The binding component of the ligand which has the strongest interaction with the protein shows the most intense STD signals, enabling the ligand’s binding epitope to be mapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512474310">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Illustration of STD NMR spectroscopy and group epitope mapping. Selective saturation of a protein is transferred to the binding parts of the ligand by intermolecular saturation transfer. STD NMR spectrum is obtained in which the only signals are from the molecule (shown in the hexagon) that binds to the protein. STD signals from non-ligand (shown in the cross-shape) do not appear in the difference spectrum. For the binding ligand, the intensity of the STD signal from the proton in the vicinity of the protein (filled circle) is bigger than that from the proton apart from the protein (open circle), even though the intrinsic intensities of both protons are the same. Hence, the degree of saturation of the individual protons of a small ligand molecule reflects their proximity to the protein surface (modified from Mayer and Meyer, 2001, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512474310">Meyer and Peters, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>In this work, we have used STD-NMR to investigate the interaction between atelocollagen and 2 functional monomers, 4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride (4-META) and 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP). Epitope mapping was then used to determine the site where the monomers bind to atelocollagens.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>4-META and MDP were provided by Sun Medical Co. Ltd. (Shiga, Japan) and Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. META contains 2 carboxyl groups, and MDP contains a phosphate group. For the collagen Type I tri-helix model, high-purity type I atelocollagen powder purified from bovine dermis (CLP-01, Koken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used. Atelocollagen was used because collagen is insoluble. Atelocollagen is produced by enzymatic digestion of the telopeptide ends of the non-helical regions of collagen. Atelocollagen retains the triple-helix structure with intact crosslinks; however, its solubility increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512474310">Friess, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512474310">Lynn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). To minimize the degradation of the triple-helices and increase the solubility, we used atelocollagen as a collagen model for the STD NMR study. The acidic monomers were dissolved in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (<italic>d</italic>
<sub>6</sub>-DMSO) to give a 20-mM ligand solution. The atelocollagen powder was dissolved in a buffer solution that contained 50 mM <italic>d</italic>
<sub>4</sub>-acetic acid, NaOD, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub> in D<sub>2</sub>O (pD 4.0). The saturated solution of atelocollagen was diluted four-fold with this buffer solution to reduce the viscosity. Each ligand solution was added to the atelocollagen solution and adjusted to a final ligand concentration of 4 mM for the STD experiment. The concentration of <italic>d</italic>
<sub>6</sub>-DMSO was 20% in the final sample solution.</p>
<p>NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on 600-MHz and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with a cryogenic probe (Bruker BioSpin Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The resonance assignments for 4-META and MDP were accomplished with the following conventional set of 2D spectra: <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>1</sup>H COSY; TOCSY with an 80-ms mixing time; NOESY with a 400-ms mixing time; <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C HMBC; and <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C HMQC. For STD experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512474310">Meyer and Peters, 2003</xref>), the selective saturation of the atelocollagen receptor protein was achieved by a train of 50-ms Gaussian-shaped pulses, yielding a total saturation train of 2 sec. The on-resonance irradiation of the protein was performed at a chemical shift of 0.86 ppm, and the off- resonance irradiation was set at 40 ppm, where no signals of ligand and/or atelocollagen were present. The STD spectra were produced by subtraction of the on- and off-resonance spectra. The total scan number for the STD experiments was 512, with 16,384 time-domain datapoints. The spectra were processed with Topspin (Bruker Biospin Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) or NMRPipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512474310">Delaglio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) and were analyzed with Topspin or NMRView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512474310">Johnson and Blevins, 1994</xref>). To confirm the STD experiment at 0.86 ppm, we also performed the on-resonance irradiation of the protein at a chemical shift of 0.91 ppm for 4-META and 3.16 ppm for MDP (see Appendix).</p>
<p>When the epitope map was created, the STD intensity relative to the reference was used. This is usually described by the STD factor, A<sub>STD</sub>, expressed by the following equation:</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The spectral data for 4-META and MDP are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512474310">Figs. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512474310">2B</xref>, respectively. The 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of 4-META and MDP in the presence of atelocollagen showed sharp resonances corresponding to each low-molecular-weight ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474310">Figs. 3A</xref> [i], 3B [i]). The double off-resonance spectrum was obtained by irradiation of a mixture of the ligand and atelocollagen at 40 ppm, where no signal associated with the ligand and atelocollagen was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474310">Figs. 3A</xref> [ii], 3B [ii]). The on-resonance spectrum was obtained when the atelocollagen was saturated by irradiation at 0.86 ppm (on-resonance spectrum not shown). The STD spectra were yielded by subtraction of the on-resonance spectrum from the off-resonance spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474310">Figs. 3A</xref> [iii], 3B [iii]). The STD NMR spectra for 4-META revealed no intense STD signals, which might indicate a weak interaction with atelocollagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474310">Fig. 3A</xref> [iii]). In contrast, clear multiple signals from MDP were detected in the STD NMR spectra (indicated by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474310">Fig. 3B</xref> [iii]). These STD NMR spectra indicate the interaction between MDP and atelocollagen. To confirm those STD results yielded by radiation at 0.86 ppm, we performed an additional on-resonance irradiation on the atelocollagen at a chemical shift at 0.91 ppm for 4-META and 3.16 ppm for MDP (see Appendix). The different signal intensities of the individual protons in MDP were further analyzed by use of the integral values in the reference and STD spectra. The integral value of the largest proton (H15) signal in MDP was set to 100%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512474310">Fig. 4</xref> shows the relative degree of saturation for the individual protons that are identified from the STD spectrum. The protons from H7 to H16 that belong to the aliphatic region show high STD intensities ranging from 73.9% to 100%. The methyl group protons, H3, also have a high intensity (92.7%), whereas the methacrylate group protons have relatively weak intensities of 61.1% and 64.1%.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The technique based on STD NMR spectra allows the binding interactions to be characterized at a molecular level. The differential STD effects for one ligand yield information on the proximity of the ligand protons to the protein surface. The STD spectra showed that the strong signals are associated with the protons of the ligand nearest to protons of the atelocollagen.</p>
<p>In 4-META, no intense STD signal was detected, whereas multiple protons in MDP contributed to the interaction with atelocollagen. The STD epitope mapping revealed that the intense STD signals were primarily associated with the aliphatic region. The protons in the methacrylate group were also involved in the interaction with atelocollagen. MDP has many sites which could interact with atelocollagen; this might imply that MDP binds to atelocollagen more strongly than 4-META. The direct interaction of MDP with atelocollagen agrees well with results obtained from bond strength tests; MDP-based adhesives produce a durable, high-strength bond to dentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512474310">Van Landuyt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The difference in STD intensity between 4-META and MDP was attributed to the difference in their chemical structure. 4-META has 2 carboxyl groups attached to the aromatic ring, and MDP has a dihydrogen phosphate group and a long aliphatic chain. This long chain makes MDP quite hydrophobic, which favors hydrophobic interaction with atelocollagen. In the general theory, hydrophobic interactions describe the relations between water and hydrophobes. Hydrophobes are low-water-soluble or non-polar molecules, usually having a long chain of carbon(s). The hydrophobic forces drive hydrophobes to aggregate and exclude water molecules in aqueous solution. This effect is entropy-driven, and originated from the disruption of dynamic hydrogen bonds between molecules of liquid water by hydrophobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512474310">Chandler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512474310">Meyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Consequently, aggregation reduces the surface area exposed to water and minimizes the disruptive effects of the hydrophobes. We conducted the NMR measurement for monomer interaction in atelocollagen solution. In a protein solution, water molecules that interact with the surface of the protein are called hydration water. Hydration water forms hydrogen bonding with the protein and has an important role in controlling the conformation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512474310">Mallamace <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This layer of hydration water should be involved in the interaction between atelocollagen and ligands. The hydrophobic force may disrupt the hydration water and drive atelocollagen and MDP to aggregate. Thus, atelocollagen and MDP tend to aggregate rather than disperse in water.</p>
<p>Although we have not provided evidence to identify further chemical bonding to ensure the stability of this aggregate, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and ionic interactions may follow the hydrophobic interaction, since MDP and atelocollagen are very close to each other. This interpretation may be consistent with that in the computer modeling and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512474310">Vaidyanathan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Those authors reported that van der Waals forces and electrostatic energy contribute to the intermolecular interaction between MDP and collagen.</p>
<p>Nakabayashi <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that the infiltration of adhesive monomers into demineralized dentin is important for improving the bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512474310">Nakabayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512474310">1991</xref>). Because the collagen was thought to be hydrophilic, they predicted that amphiphilic functional monomers should improve dentin bonding. In their context, the hydrophilic moiety would allow the monomer to penetrate the collagen matrix and form a collagen–resin hybrid layer. The hydrophobic moiety would bond to the hydrophobic resins in the adhesives. The formation of a hybrid layer results from the penetration of the monomers into the spatial network in the collagen matrix, followed by <italic>in situ</italic> polymerization. This concept of hybrid layers is widely acknowledged in adhesive dentistry. However, our STD results raise questions about this interpretation of the function of the hydrophobic adhesive monomers, such as MDP. The STD results involving soluble collagen suggest that the hydrophilic moiety does not interact with collagen in its dissolved state, but that the hydrophobic moiety appears to contribute to stable interaction. Thus, the hydrophobic moiety in some functional monomers may be responsible for both bonding to the hydrophobic resin matrix in the restoration and for the interaction with collagen.</p>
<p>We used atelocollagen to represent a collagen molecule. Collagen fibrils are composed of multiple discontinuous repeats of collagen molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512474310">Bertassoni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Thus, it may be noted that atelocollagen is not precisely a collagen model. When MDP infiltrates demineralized dentin, a surface of collagen fibrils is more involved with MDP-interaction than a single collagen molecule. The features of this surface are difficult to identify, but MDP may first wet the exposed collagen fibrils with its hydrophilic moiety. Because collagen fibrils are inherently surrounded by water molecules, the hydrophilic moiety is important for allowing the monomers to spread over the substrate. The hydrophobic moiety then allows the monomer to form the monomer-collagen aggregates, which provide stable adhesion in hybrid layers.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the chemical interaction between MDP and hydroxyapatite (HAp) has been recently documented. MDP bonds through its phosphate group to HAp and forms a layered structure at the HAp surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512474310">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512474310">Yoshihara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Formation of the MDP-HAp layer was not confirmed in our NMR study. However, the epitope mapping demonstrated that the phosphate group in MDP is less responsible for hydrophobic interaction with collagen. This finding indicates that MDP interacts with HAp through its phosphate group and with collagen through its hydrophobic region. Therefore, we speculate that the MDP-HAp layering structure would further interact with collagen, but this lies beyond the scope of the current study. Moreover, it is not fully understood whether the monomers that interact with collagen are polymerized <italic>in situ</italic>. Although the methacrylate group is not directly involved in the interaction with atelocollagen, it may cause the MDP molecules to lose the rotational freedom required for polymerization when the monomer interacts with collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512474310">Peiffer, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The results obtained from the STD NMR analysis show that MDP has a stable interaction with collagen. Based on the epitope mapping, this interaction was associated with a hydrophobic effect between the hydrophobic aliphatic moiety in MDP and the collagen surface.</p>

<abstract>
<p>PRMT5 has been reported to be involved in the processes of tumor progression at various steps. The aim of this study was to examine the role of PRMT5 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In this study, PRMT5 and Ki-67 expression were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in cohorts of normal, benign, and cancerous ovarian tissues. PRMT5 overexpression was observed in 83.1% (98/118) of EOCs, and it was significantly associated with serous type, poor differentiation, advanced tumor stage, lymph node invasion, presence of residual tumor, and high expression of Ki-67 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, respectively). Moreover, overexpression of PRMT5 was an independent prognostic marker for decreased overall survival and progression-free survival in univariate survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. In ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and SKOV3, PRMT5 knockdown by siRNA inhibited cell growth/proliferation and induced apoptosis via upregulation of E2F-1. These results suggest that overexpression of PRMT5 correlates with an aggressive malignant phenotype and may constitute a novel prognostic factor for EOC. Thus, PRMT5 may represent a clinically effective new target for therapy of ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of death from gynecological malignancies. Despite the improvement in surgical techniques and the advent of more effective therapeutics, the overall 5-year survival has increased only from 36% to 44% during the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155413475452">Siegel et al. 2012</xref>). More than 80% of ovarian cancers are of epithelial origin, which are highly invasive, respond poorly to therapies, and are usually detected at advanced stages, resulting in poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155413475452">Auersperg et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155413475452">Jordan et al. 2006</xref>). To improve better prognostic and predictive assays and develop new therapeutic strategies for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we must understand the molecular mechanisms underlying EOC.</p> <p>Arginine methylation is becoming more acknowledged as an important type of posttranslational modification found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155413475452">Bedford and Richard 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155413475452">Bedford and Clarke 2009</xref>). The posttranslational modification of protein arginine methylation is widely appreciated, playing a vital role in cellular function. The methylation of arginine residues is catalyzed by the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), which can catalyze the addition of one or two methyl groups to the guanidine nitrogen atoms of arginine. To date, PRMT family have been found 11 members in humans (including PRMT1-11), and most PRMTs, with the exception of PRMT2, PRMT10, and PRMT11, have been shown to have enzymatic activity and can catalyze arginine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155413475452">Bedford and Richard 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155413475452">Pal and Sif 2007</xref>). Based on the primary protein sequence and the specificity for distinct substrates, PRMTs are mainly classified as type I and type II enzymes. These two types of enzymes catalyze the formation of a mono-methylated (MMA) intermediate; subsequently, type I PRMTs (PRMT1, 3, 4, 6, and 8) further catalyze the production of asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues (aDMA), and type II PRMTs (PRMT5, 7, and 9) catalyze the formation of symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues (sDMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155413475452">Bedford 2007</xref>). Arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), the first identified type II enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155413475452">Branscombe et al. 2001</xref>), is 637 amino acids long and maps to in human chromosome 14q11.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155413475452">Krause et al. 2007</xref>) and is involved in a variety of biological processes, including ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155413475452">Ren et al. 2010</xref>), assembly of the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155413475452">Zhou et al. 2010</xref>), cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155413475452">Dacwag et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155413475452">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155413475452">Mallappa et al. 2011</xref>), cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155413475452">Scoumanne et al. 2009</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. 2012</xref>), and germ cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155413475452">Ancelin et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155413475452">Eckert et al. 2008</xref>). PRMT5 can methylate H3R8 and H4R3 to induce silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such as ST7 and NM23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155413475452">Pal et al. 2004</xref>). In addition, it has been shown to interact with many other genes, such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155413475452">Scoumanne et al. 2009</xref>), E2F-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. 2012</xref>), IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155413475452">Richard et al. 2005</xref>), cyclin E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155413475452">Fabbrizio et al. 2002</xref>), TRAIL receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022155413475452">Tanaka et al. 2009</xref>), the CDK4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155413475452">Aggarwal et al. 2010</xref>), and E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155413475452">Hou et al. 2008</xref>), to participate in many cellular processes. In humans, PRMT5 is widely expressed in many organs (such as heart, muscle, and testis) at different levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155413475452">Pollack et al. 1999</xref>). Aberrant expression of PRMT5 is found in a wide variety of human diseases, especially in many cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155413475452">Pal et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155413475452">Wang et al. 2008</xref>), gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155413475452">Kim et al. 2005</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155413475452">Powers et al. 2011</xref>), and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. 2012</xref>), and is related to poor outcome in patients with breast cancer and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155413475452">Powers et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>However, little is known about the role of PRMT5 in ovarian cancer. In this study, we investigated the expression profile of PRMT5 protein in ovarian cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and determined its correlation with clinicopathological features and its possible prognostic significance. Then we further confirmed the action of PRMT5 in regulating cell growth/proliferation and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and SKOV3.</p>

<p>All EOC patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy based on platinum postoperatively, and the clinical outcomes were available. All patients had been followed up from the date of surgical treatment to January 2012. The follow-up time ranged from 3 to 81 months, with a median of 32 months. Follow-up information included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). OS was calculated from the date of surgery to the date of death or last follow-up, and PFS was from the date of surgery to the date of documented disease progression.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022155413475452">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>IHC staining was performed with the standard streptavidin-peroxidase complex method. Sections (4 µm) were stained with anti-PRMT5 (1:200; EIAab Science, Wuhan, China) and anti–Ki-67 (1:100; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) overnight at 4C, incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibody and developed with a horseradish peroxidase–labeled streptavidin reagent, and then stained for 3 min with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Histostain-plus kit; Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with neutral balsam. The primary antibody was replaced with 1 × PBS as a negative control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022155413475452">
<title>Evaluation and Quantification of Immunostaining</title>
<p>Evaluation of staining of PRMT5 and Ki-67 was independently done by two pathologists in a blinded manner. PRMT5 was scored for both nuclear and cytoplasm staining. It was scored semiquantitatively based on a staining intensity of 0 = no staining, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = strong expression, as well as the following distribution: 0 = less than 5%, 1 = 6% to 20%, 2 = 21% to 50%, and 3 = greater than 50% staining. The immunoscore was expressed as a combined score of staining intensity and distribution, with a maximal combined immunoscore of 6. Tumors with a final staining score ≥4 were defined as having a high expression of PRMT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155413475452">Liang et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To measure Ki-67 expression, nuclei from at least 1000 tumor cells were counted from the fields, and the labeling index was calculated as the percentage of labeled nuclei of the total number of tumor cells that were counted. The median was used to dichotomize into low- and high-expressing groups for Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155413475452">Ali-Fehmi et al. 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Human ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and A2780 were obtained from the Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai. A2780 was grown in RPMI-1640, and SKOV3 was grown in McCoy’s 5A containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified atmosphere at 37C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>siRNA Transfection</title>
<p>The two human PRMT5 siRNA sequences (siRNA-1 [siP1], 5′-GGGACUGGAAUACGCUAAUTT-3′ and 5′- AUUAGCGUAUUCCAGUCCCTT-3′; siRNA-2 [siP2], 5′-GGACCUGAGAGAUGAUAUATT-3′ and 5′-UAU AUCAUCUCUCAGGUCCTT-3′) and the scrambled siRNA sequence (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ and 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′) were designed and synthesized by Genepharma Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Cancer cells were incubated in culture without antibiotics for 24 hr prior to transfection, resulting in 30% to 50% confluence. Then they were transfected with PRMT5 siRNA (siP1 and siP2) or control scrambled siRNA (siC) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) using the Lipofectamime 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The ratio of Lipofectamime 2000 to siRNA was 1:1. Silencing of PRMT5 was assayed for mRNA and protein expression level at 48 hr and 72 hr after transfection, respectively. Each transfection was repeated three times. Untransfected ovarian cancer cells were the normal control.</p>

<title>Quantitative Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>At 48 hr posttransfection, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) in a standard procedure. Reverse transcription was carried out using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara; Dalian, China). Real-time PCR was then performed using SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO; Osaka, Japan) in the LightCycler 2.0 PCR instrument (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR reaction conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95C for 30 sec, followed by 45 cycles of 95C for 5 sec, 10 sec at 58C, and 15 sec at 72C; and a final extension at 65C for 15 sec.

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>At 72 hr after transfection, protein lysates were extracted in RIPA buffer according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Bytotime, Jiangsu, China). Denatured protein samples were equally (70 µg) loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes using the Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) electrotransfer system. The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST; 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-PRMT5 and anti–E2F-1 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and mouse anti–β-actin (1:1000; Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit [1:4000; Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology]) were added for 1 hr at room temperature. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and recorded by Kodak molecular imaging software (Kodak; Rochester, NY). Western blot was performed at least three times for each sample. The band intensity was measured by Image J (National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD), and the relative protein expression was normalized to β-actin.</p>

<title>PRMT5 Is Highly Expressed in EOC and the Expression Level Is Correlated with the Proliferation Activity</title>
<p>Positive staining for PRMT5 was observed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the staining of Ki-67 was in the nucleus of ovarian tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155413475452">Fig. 1</xref>). Using the criteria described earlier, high expression of PRMT5 was observed in 4 of 12 (33.3%) normal ovaries, in 6 of 20 (30%) benign tumors, and in 98 of 118 (83.1%) EOCs, respectively. The level of PRMT5 in EOCs was the highest (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), and there was no significant difference between normal ovaries and benign tumors. In normal and benign tumor cases with a high expression of PRMT5, the expression was mostly localized to the epithelium, and most of the scores for positive tissue staining were 4 to 5 and classified as mild to moderate staining. Interestingly, there was stronger staining of PRMT5 in epithelial inclusion cysts and stromal cells of normal ovaries in some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155413475452">Fig. 1E</xref>). The relationship between the expression of PRMT5 in EOCs and the clinicopathological features of the patients is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022155413475452">Table 1</xref>. High expression of PRMT5 was significantly associated with serous subtype, advanced FIGO stage, poor differentiation, lymph node invasion, and the presence of residual tumor (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, respectively).</p>

<p>Because PRMT5 has been implicated in promoting cell proliferation, we stained the same set of EOC specimens with Ki-67, a cell proliferation marker that has been used as a measure of tumor proliferative activity. The median for the Ki-67 labeling index in the entire cohort was 25%, and we used this as a cutoff for the high versus low Ki-67 labeling index. A significant positive correlation was noted between PRMT5 expression in tumor cells and Ki-67 expression (<italic>r</italic> = 0.377, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), in which tumors with high Ki-67 expression had a significantly higher expression of PRMT5 (69.2% vs 98.2%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Together, we conclude that PRMT5 is significantly increased in primary EOC, and its expression correlates with a high proliferation index, as revealed by Ki-67 staining.</p>

<title>Level of PRMT5 Is Negatively Correlated with Survival of Ovarian Cancer Patients</title>
<p>At the end of the follow-up period, of the 118 ovarian cancer patients, 63 (53.4%) had died, with 61 patients dying from cancer-related causes and 2 patients from other causes. The median OS time of patients was 40 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.1–60.1), and median PFS time was 20 months (95% CI, 16.8–23.2). To evaluate the impact of elevated PRMT5 expression on OS and PFS, we first performed a univariate analysis of traditional clinicopathogical variables for prognosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022155413475452">Table 3</xref>). In the OS analyses, serous subtype, PRMT5 expression, age, FIGO stage, and tumor differentiation, but not other clinicopathological features, were significant predictors of OS. In the PFS analyses, all clinicopathological variables, except lymph node invasion, were significant predictors of PFS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022155413475452">Table 3</xref>). Univariate analysis by log-rank test indicated that patients with high PRMT5 expression had a significantly poorer OS and shorter PFS than those with low PRMT5 expression (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155413475452">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

This suggests that overexpression of PRMT5 is an early event during EOC development. Furthermore, the expression of PRMT5 was increased along with the progression of the disease. These results demonstrate that PRMT5 may play a crucial role as an oncogene in the development of EOC. Different histologies of EOC have distinct pathogenetic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155413475452">Kobel et al. 2008</xref>). Serous ovarian cancer, the most common subtype of EOC, is a predominant advanced-stage carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155413475452">Gilks 2004</xref>). In our study, the level of PRMT5 expression was higher in the serous subtype than in the non-serous subtype. Because the number of the serous subtype was larger than that of the non-serous subtype, the difference of PRMT5 expression between histological differentiation was uncertain, we should add the number of non-serous subtype cases to verify the difference in the further study.</p>
<p>The cellular localization of PRMT5 has not been identified in different types of cells. In most primary and immortalized cells, PRMT5 is mainly in the cytoplasm, with a small amount in the nucleus, whereas in transformed cells, this distribution is reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155413475452">Pal et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155413475452">2007</xref>). In the nucleus, PRMT5 may promote cell proliferation and transformation by transcriptionally silencing cell cycle controllers and tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155413475452">Pal et al. 2004</xref>). In our study, PRMT5 existed in both the nuclei and cytoplasm, but mainly in the nuclei, of ovarian cancer cells. This result was similar to the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. (2012)</xref> and further indicated that PRMT5 was involved in the regulation of ovarian cancer growth and proliferation. Many studies have shown that PRMT5 is involved in the regulation of major signaling pathways that affect cell death and malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155413475452">Scoumanne et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022155413475452">Tabata et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022155413475452">Yang et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155413475452">Aggarwal et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155413475452">Liu et al. 2011</xref>). To verify the function of PRMT5 to regulate the growth of ovarian cancer cells, we analyzed the expression of Ki-67, a proliferation-related nuclear protein. Ki-67 has a low level of expression in resting cells and a high level in proliferating cells and has been routinely used as a measure of tumor proliferative activity. In our study, we also found that the expression of PRMT5 was positively correlated with the expression of Ki-67, in which tumors with a high Ki-67 expression had a significantly higher expression of PRMT5. These findings suggest a possible role for PRMT5 in promoting ovarian cancer cell proliferation and in the progression of ovarian carcinoma.</p>
<p>In the survival analysis, a high level of PRMT5 was identified as an independent factor for poor prognosis in patients with EOC. Recently, PRMT5 was identified as a cofactor that greatly alters the function of programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) in breast cancer, and overexpression of PRMT5 was found to correlate with a worse outcome within a cohort of breast cancer patients whose tumors contained a higher expression of PDCD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155413475452">Powers et al. 2011</xref>). Another study also showed that high levels of PRMT5 coincide with low levels of E2F-1 and reflect a poor clinical outcome in colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. 2012</xref>). These studies showed that PRMT5 may be a good prognostic marker for survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.</p>
<p>We have found that PRMT5 was correlated with the expression of Ki-67 in EOC, which indicates that PRMT5 is able to promote cell proliferation in vivo, but the regulatory action of PRMT5 in ovarian cancer cells is not clear in vitro. To verify this idea, we investigated the role of PRMT5 in cell proliferation and apoptosis in EOC cell lines A2780 and SKOV3. Indeed, we found that downregulation of PRMT5 had an effect on growth inhibition of ovarian cancer cells in CCK8 and Ki-67 labeling assays. We also revealed that downregulation of PRMT5 could induce apoptosis in A2780 and SKOV3 cells using flow cytometry.</p>
<p>Multiple genes have been implicated in PRMT5 knockdown-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155413475452">Fabbrizio et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155413475452">Pal et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155413475452">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155413475452">Wang et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155413475452">Scoumanne et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. 2012</xref>). To further address the mechanism through which PRMT5 regulates growth and apoptosis in EOC, we investigated whether PRMT5 regulates the expression of E2F-1. Our results demonstrated that the depletion of PRMT5 by siRNA could upregulate E2F-1 mRNA and protein expression, both in A2780 and SKOV3 cells. E2F is a complex family of transcription factors implicated in different cells and involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155413475452">Polager and Ginsberg 2008</xref>). E2F-1, as a member of this gene family, is crucial for E2F-dependent apoptotic programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155413475452">Lazzerini Denchi and Helin 2005</xref>). E2F-1 overexpression also has a growth-promoting effect in EOC cells and is thought to be a useful prognostic indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155413475452">Suh et al. 2008</xref>). E2F-1 is directly methylated by PRMT5, and this arginine methylation plays an important role in regulating the biochemical function of E2F-1, which affects E2F-1–dependent growth control. Downregulation of PRMT5 has been shown to increase E2F-1 protein levels in U2OS and HCT116 cells, which caused a decreased growth rate and the induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155413475452">Cho et al. 2012</xref>). In our study, we also found that the E2F-1 expression coincides with PRMT5 in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that PRMT5 could regulate growth and apoptosis through E2F-1.</p>
<p>In summary, our results showed that PRMT5 was expressed in ovarian cancers at variable levels, and that expression was related to tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. Our results further provided in vitro evidence in support of the role of PRMT5 as an oncogene in ovarian cancer cells and provided new possible molecular mechanisms for the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer. Depleting PRMT5 by siRNA was able to substantially inhibit growth and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and induced apoptosis in vitro; thus, the downregulation of this gene could be a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. More research is needed to elucidate the relevance of PRMT5 and the molecular pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.</p>

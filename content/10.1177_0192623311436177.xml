<abstract>
<p>The rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) is used extensively in translational biomedical research and drug development studies and is an important model of aging. Macaques often develop myocardial fibrosis with age, which can result in the loss of normal cardiac architecture with the expansion of the extracellular matrix and deposition of collagen. The etiology and pathogenesis of this pernicious process is poorly understood. Cardiac fibrosis was assessed using histologic and immunohistochemical techniques in cardiac tissue sections from 34 rhesus macaques. Overall left ventricular and left ventricular mid-myocardial interstitial/perivascular fibrosis were positively correlated with age (<italic>r</italic> = .6522, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001 and <italic>r</italic> = .4704, <italic>p</italic> = .005, respectively). When divided into young (mean = 2.8 years), middle-aged (mean = 17.5 years), and advanced age (mean = 29.2 years) groups, immunophenotypic characterization of antigen presenting cells revealed differential expression of CD163 and DC-SIGN between the young and middle-aged groups compared to the advanced age group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). HAM-56 expression decreased significantly in the advanced age cohort (<italic>p</italic> = .0021). The expression of CD8, CD163, and DC-SIGN correlated positively with age (<italic>r</italic> = .3999, <italic>p</italic> = .0191; <italic>r</italic> = .5676, <italic>p</italic> = .0005; <italic>r</italic> = .5245, <italic>p</italic> = .0014, respectively). These results show the importance of myocardial fibrosis as a common age-related pathology and additionally, alterations in T cell, macrophage, and dendritic cell phenotype in rhesus macaque myocardium are associated with age but unassociated with the fibrosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fibrotic cardiac remodeling and increased collagen deposition is strongly associated with aging in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623311436177">Roth et al. 2004</xref>). This is also the case in aging rhesus macaques, where there are close parallels to the physiological changes observed in aging humans. Additional similar cardiac pathologies include myocardial infarction, interstitial fibrosis, and congestive heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623311436177">Roth et al. 2004</xref>). Although rodents are extensively used as models for aging and cardiovascular diseases, research using rhesus macaques provides a model more phylogenetically similar to humans, thereby better elucidating the shared pathogenesis of numerous disease processes including cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192623311436177">Appt and Ethun 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623311436177">Chamanza et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192623311436177">Clarkson et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623311436177">Lowenstine 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192623311436177">Park et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192623311436177">Pick, Janicki, and Weber 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623311436177">Roth et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623311436177">Vidal et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623311436177">Weber et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623311436177">Zabka, Irwin, and Albassam 2009</xref>). Although rhesus macaques are a species used as animal models in safety studies, myocardial fibrosis has been poorly studied in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623311436177">Lammey et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623311436177">Lowenstine 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623311436177">Keenan and Vidal 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623311436177">Chamanza et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623311436177">Zabka, Irwin, and Albassam 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The rhesus macaque is a superior model for many aspects of biomedical research. One important area is normal aging, where the rhesus macaque has been studied from multiple perspectives. In addition, rhesus macaques are frequently used in preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies for the assessments of cardiovascular safety of drugs intended for use in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623311436177">Lowenstine 2003</xref>). Interpretation of the histological changes in the research animals involved in these studies requires that the pathologist be able to differentiate drug-induced histopathologic lesions in the heart from normal histomorphology, incidental, and/or background lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623311436177">Chamanza et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623311436177">Zabka, Irwin, and Albassam 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623311436177">Lowenstine 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623311436177">Keenan and Vidal 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Cardiac myocytes are surrounded and supported by an extracellular matrix (ECM) that is composed of cohesive glycoproteins, proteoglycans, growth factors, and proteases as well as structural proteins such as collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623311436177">de Souza 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192623311436177">Kumar, Fausto, and Aster 2010</xref>). The ECM acts to distribute mechanical forces, helps to convey mechanical signals, and electrically separates the atria from the ventricles to provide appropriate cardiac performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>). Excess ECM typically manifests as cardiac fibrosis in which there is robust accumulation of collagen expanding the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623311436177">Wei 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192623311436177">Wynn 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">Wynn 2008</xref>). The majority of cardiac diseases are associated with some degree of fibrosis in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, two forms of cardiac fibrosis are described in humans. <italic>Reactive fibrosis</italic> occurs in response to chronic diseases such as systemic hypertension, myocarditis, and cardiac muscle hypertrophy. It serves as a mechanism to accommodate pressure overload and to maintain cardiac output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192623311436177">Weber et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623311436177">Anderson, Sutton, and Lie 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623311436177">Allessie et al. 2005</xref>). In this phase of repair, interstitial fibrosis progresses without the loss of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">Wynn 2008</xref>). <italic>Replacement fibrosis</italic> is the second phase of repair in which disease progression continues and myocytes are replaced by scars of fibrotic connective tissue in an effort to preserve the structural integrity of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623311436177">Allessie et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">Wynn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192623311436177">Weber et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623311436177">Moriwaki et al. 2004</xref>). As a result of these fibrotic lesions in the myocardium, there is increased stiffness, diastolic dysfunction, reduction of electrical coupling between myocytes, and abnormalities in cardiac conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623311436177">Lammey et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192623311436177">Chen and Frangogiannis 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192623311436177">Goumans, van Zonneveld, and ten Dijke 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Macrophages and dendritic cells produce cytokines that influence immune responses, serve as profibrotic mediators, and activate myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623311436177">Frangogiannis 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">Wynn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623311436177">Yearley et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>). Myofibroblasts are the key cellular mediators of the extracellular matrix and contributors to fibrosis in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>). The role that macrophages and other immune cells play in cardiac fibrogenesis in rhesus macaques is unknown. However, studies of fibrogenesis in myocardial infarction, experimentally induced hypertension, myocarditis, and normal aging conducted in humans, rats, mice, canines, and chimpanzees have implicated a number of inflammatory cells including T cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in contributing to the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192623311436177">Chen and Frangogiannis 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623311436177">Dobaczewski et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192623311436177">Ely et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192623311436177">Frangogiannis et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192623311436177">Yano et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192623311436177">Yu, Horak, and Larson 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although inflammation typically precedes fibrosis, the results from numerous experimental models show that the amount of fibrosis is not necessarily linked with the severity of inflammation and that chronic inflammation does not always induce the deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. These findings suggest that the mechanisms that regulate fibrogenesis are distinct from those that regulate inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192623311436177">Wynn 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The goals of the current study were to identify possible variations in T cell, macrophage, and dendritic cell immunohistophenotypes in myocardial tissue and to determine if these alterations corresponded to the development of cardiac fibrosis in normal aging rhesus macaques.</p>

<title>Study Design Groups</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of left ventricle from 34 rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) from the pathology archives of the New England Primate Research Center were assessed. Rhesus macaques reach puberty at an age of approximately 3 years, and the expected lifespan is between 25 and 30 years of age. On this basis, the subjects were placed into three separate cohorts. Eleven animals were from a group of juvenile macaques from 2 and a half to 3 years of age (mean = 2.8 years). Twelve animals were middle-aged adult macaques, 14 to 23 years old (mean = 17.5 years). Finally, a group of 11 macaques, ranging from 26.5 to 31.5 years old, comprised the advanced age cohort (mean = 29.2 years). The animals in the young cohort were juveniles that served as control animals in an HIV vaccination study. They were euthanized humanely at the end of the study. There were no significant gross findings. The members of the middle-aged cohort also served as control animals in a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine study or were part of a normal aging study. These animals were also euthanized at the termination of the study. No clinical abnormalities were noted in these animals; however, incidental comorbid findings revealed at necropsy or during the subsequent histological examination included mild myocarditis, <italic>Pneumonyssus simicola </italic>bronchiectasis and bronchitis, mild vaginitis, mild endometritis, mild hepatitis, typhlocolitis, mild glomerulonephritis, and gastritis. The macaques that composed the advanced age cohort were part of a normal aging study that investigated behavioral and cognitive changes. Comorbidities discovered at necropsy or subsequently at histological examination included benign and malignant neoplasms of the intestine, ovary, uterus, adrenal gland, stomach, or pituitary gland. These animals were not known to have received any compounds or drugs. All subjects were negative for SIV and were confirmed to be tuberculosis negative with quarterly intradermal testing.</p>
<p>All the animals included in this study were cared for in accordance with the National Research Council’s <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and the standards of the Harvard Medical School Standing Committee on Animals and the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0192623311436177">
<title>Histological Staining</title>
<p>All animals were necropsied within 24 hours of death; and representative sections of all major organs were collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Left ventricular free wall sections from each subject were examined for this study. Additional sections of left ventricular free wall were stained with Masson’s trichrome stain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0192623311436177">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Standard immunoperoxidase staining for CD3, CD8, CD68, CD83, CD163, HAM-56, and DC-SIGN was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of left ventricular free wall from each subject (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192623311436177">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623311436177">Yearley et al. 2007</xref>). CD3 and CD8 were used to identify T cells. CD68, CD83, CD163, HAM-56, and DC-SIGN were used to identify antigen presenting cells. All sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by blocking with 3% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). A wash of tris-buffered saline followed each step. Following pretreatment, an avidin-biotin block (Invitrogen Corporation, Frederick, MD) and then a Dako Protein block (Carpinteria, CA) were conducted on all sections.</p>

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>All immunohistochemically labeled sections were examined with an Olympus BX41 light microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). The total number of DAB stained cells was counted in 10 random high-magnification fields (400×) for each section.</p>
<p>Masson’s trichrome stained whole slides of left ventricular free wall were scanned using a Nikon Super Coolscan 5000 slide scanner (Nikon Inc., Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at a resolution of 4,000 pixels per inch and a color depth of 8 bits per channel. Pixels were classified as fibrosis (blue), cardiac muscle (red), or background (white) by means of a custom image analysis algorithm. Briefly, the RGB color values of each pixel were considered as an absorbance vector originating at &lt;255, 255, 255&gt; corresponding to zero absorbance (white background). Representative absorbance vectors for blue stain wavelengths, &lt;140, 111, 78&gt;, and red stain wavelengths, &lt;42, 206, 126&gt;, were defined by averaging the values of several manually selected pixels of each color. Pixels were classified as fibrosis, muscle, or background based on the least angle between their absorbance vectors and the representative vectors multiplied by a tolerance factor. The correctness of the classification process was confirmed by comparison of an algorithmically generated red/green pseudo-fluorescent image with the original scan. Percentage fibrosis in each section is reported as the number of blue pixels divided by the total of red and blue pixels. Overall fibrosis of the left ventricular sections was calculated for each animal. Overall left ventricular fibrosis was defined as any and all fibrosis evident by Masson’s trichrome staining in the entire tissue section analyzed.</p>
<p>Ten photomicrographs of the mid-myocardium in each of the Masson’s trichrome stained sections were randomly taken at 100× using Olympus DP2-BSW microscope digital camera software (Olympus Corporation). The endocardial, subendocardial, and epicardial areas were avoided to ensure that the photomicrographs captured interstitial and perivascular fibrosis of the mid-myocardial region. Areas of fibrosis were neither intentionally nor unintentionally captured for analysis. Percent fibrosis was determined as above.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests were used to calculate the significance of fibrosis (overall left ventricular, interstitial/perivascular) among the cohorts. Comparisons between fibrosis (overall left ventricular, interstitial/perivascular) and age were determined using nonparametric Spearman correlation.</p>
<p>The significance of the differences in IHC staining among the three cohorts was determined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey posttest. Correlations between expression of the T cell, macrophage, and dendritic cell markers (CD8, CD163, and DC-SIGN) and age were determined assuming data were sampled from Gaussian populations (Pearson correlation).</p>
<p>For all statistical tests, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).</p>

<title>Overall Left Ventricular and Interstitial/Perivascular Fibrosis</title>
<p>Myocardial fibrosis in the aged human population is a chronic and widespread pathological finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623311436177">Anderson, Sutton, and Lie 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192623311436177">Chen and Frangogiannis 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>). A number of animal models including mice and rats provide strong evidence that the development of cardiac fibrosis is associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192623311436177">Cieslik et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623311436177">Boyle et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623311436177">de Jong, van Rijen, and de Bakker 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192623311436177">Debessa and de Souza 2001</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the degree of cardiac fibrosis over various age groups in rhesus macaques. Because there is often a link between fibrogenesis and alterations in local inflammatory cells, we also used immunohistochemistry to identify and enumerate the local tissue T cell, macrophage, and dendritic cell population variations across three age groups of normal rhesus macaques to determine if there was an association with the fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623311436177">Yearley et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">Wynn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192623311436177">Yearley et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623311436177">Wei 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our work indicates that cardiac fibrosis increases with age and is a common finding among normal rhesus macaques. Although the evaluated population of myocardial immune cells altered across the age groups, there was no direct correlation with the degree of cardiac fibrosis.</p>

<sec id="section15-0192623311436177">
<title>T Cells</title>
<p>CD3 is a cell surface marker that identifies T cells, while CD8 is specific for the cytotoxic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623311436177">Leong and Leong 2003</xref>). T lymphocytes are thought to affect the ECM by modulating collagen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192623311436177">Yu, Horak, and Larson 2006</xref>). A number of studies involving patients with heart disease as well as those in animal models have shown that infiltration of T lymphocytes in the myocardium is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192623311436177">Wynn 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623311436177">Kvakan et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192623311436177">Yu et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623311436177">Vidal et al. 2010</xref>). While no direct correlation was observed between CD3 or CD8 density and measurements of overall left ventricular and interstitial fibrosis, positive correlations were observed between these markers and age. The presence of T lymphocytes indicates chronicity of inflammation. However, given that the degree of fibrosis does not correlate with our measures of CD3 and CD8 expression, this suggests that fibrogenesis may be driven by factors separate from those regulating chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">Wynn 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Antigen Presenting Cells</title>
<p>Macrophages, along with T lymphocytes, have been implicated in the alteration of the ECM leading to cardiac fibrosis in humans and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623311436177">Frangogiannis 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192623311436177">Yu et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623311436177">Krenning, Zeisberg, and Kalluri 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">Wynn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623311436177">Yearley et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192623311436177">Hinglais et al. 1994</xref>). CD68 is a classic macrophage marker. HAM-56 is an uncharacterized antigen that labels a large subset of monocyte-macrophage lineage cells and is conventionally used to identify macrophages in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623311436177">Yearley et al. 2007</xref>). CD163 is a marker for macrophages with anti-inflammatory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623311436177">Yearley et al. 2007</xref>). Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells that play a central role in the adaptive immune response and have unique migratory properties that separate them from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623311436177">Randolph, Ochando, and Partida-Sanchez 2008</xref>). DC-SIGN is a marker for the dendritic cell specific C type lectin that mediates adhesion to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192623311436177">Geijtenbeek et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings show that there is significant alteration of the immune cells expressing CD68, CD163, HAM-56, and DC-SIGN between the different cohorts. These alterations indicate that the local populations of these cells differ depending on the age of the animal and may indicate that the biological role of these cells evolves with age. These alterations may also shape the character of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192623311436177">Mosser 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that activated macrophage populations switch phenotypes over time responding to environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192623311436177">Mosser and Edwards 2008</xref>). This is consistent with our results showing a marked plasticity to the antigen cell populations as rhesus macaques age.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is a direct correlation between aging in macaques and fibrogenesis in the myocardium. Myocardial fibrosis is a common background lesion in aged rhesus macaques and must be considered when assessing drug-induced cardiovascular lesions in preclinical toxicological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623311436177">Lowenstine 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623311436177">Chamanza et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623311436177">Qureshi 1979</xref>). In addition, there are striking differences in the immune cell phenotypes across three age groups with some phenotypes (CD8, DC-SIGN, and CD163) being directly correlated with age. T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells may play distinct and evolving roles with age, which may alter myocardial disease susceptibility and suggest that the mechanisms that drive fibrogenesis may be distinct from those that are regulating chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192623311436177">Wynn 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623311436177">2008</xref>).</p>

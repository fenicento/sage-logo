<p>
<bold>Objective:</bold> To assess the impact of pharmacist counseling on empowering people with diabetes to better self-care. <bold>Introduction:</bold> Community-based pharmacists can play a key role in educating and empowering people in such programs. <bold>Methods:</bold> A randomized trial compared the effects of pharmacist counseling (intervention group) with printed materials (control group) in diabetic beneficiaries of several employer-based health care plans. All participants also received waiver of out-of-pocket expenses for diabetic-related medications and supplies. Clinical, humanistic, and claim outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 1 year follow-up. <bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-seven beneficiaries participated in this study. The 0.50% decrease from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0008) in the intervention group and the difference between the groups approached statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .076). Beneficiaries in both groups had greater claim costs for diabetic-related medications and supplies during the study year. Both groups also improved in ability to manage their diabetes with the counseling group showing a significantly better understanding of diabetes (<italic>P </italic>= .0024). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> There was a trend toward improvement in A1c in patients counseled by pharmacist with an increased utilization of diabetes-related medications and supplies. Counseling also improved diabetes knowledge and empowered patients to better diabetes management.</p>

<title>Background and Significance</title>
<p>Guidelines recommend controlling blood glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure in patients with diabetes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011418513">1</xref>
</sup> However, fewer than 57% of these patients achieve control of blood glucose as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (denoted A1c) concentrations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011418513">2</xref>
</sup> Given the expense of caring for patients with diabetes (including severe complications such as chronic kidney disease, amputations, and cardiovascular disease), employers may potentially improve quality of life for their employees and cut health care costs by sponsoring programs which demonstrate the capacity to educate and empower employees with diabetes to better self-management. Community-based pharmacists can play a key role in educating and empowering people in such programs. Perhaps the best-known example is the Asheville Project in which the human resources department of a self-insured employer (City of Asheville), an insurance claims processor, university educators, and health care providers in Asheville, North Carolina, developed an employer-based program to empower patients with diabetes to better manage their diabetes and improve their health status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011418513">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011418513">4</xref>
</sup> This project used a quasi-experimental, before-and-after study design to compare clinical outcomes, pharmacy claims, and other health-related expenditures before and after the intervention. Subsequently the American Pharmacy Association (APhA) sponsored the Patient Self Management Program (PSMP) for diabetes study involving beneficiaries of 8 employers in different geographic areas<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011418513">5</xref>
</sup> and an expanded study in the United States, the Diabetes Ten City Challenge (DTCC).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011418513">6</xref>
</sup> These latter 2 studies also used a quasi-experimental, before-and-after design. An Australian group published a randomized trial within a large cohort study (the Fremantle Diabetes Study) in which patients were randomly allocated to a pharmaceutical care program or a control group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011418513">7</xref>
</sup> The pharmaceutical-care group had telephone contact at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter with a pharmacist and also had face-to-face visits at 6 and 12 months. The control group was followed as part of the cohort study with no further intervention. The intervention group had significantly greater reductions in A1c, fasting plasma glucose, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) than did the control group.</p>
<p>A quasi-experimental, before-and-after study design does not provide the same level of evidence as a randomized trial. An intervention (eg, pharmacist counseling to enhance patient empowerment) is a useful measurable difference between the 2 time periods (before and after intervention), but other differences in care or patient education may also have occurred outside of the study. For example, if an aggressive series of public service announcements were run during the study period, the effects of the primary study intervention could be confounded by these announcements. The primary objective of the EMPOWER project is to use a randomized trial design to determine whether counseling by community pharmacists that provides patient education, goal-setting, monitoring, and coaching can better improve patient self-management of diabetes as measured by A1c concentrations compared to the distribution of written educational materials without pharmacist counseling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0897190011418513">
<title>Study Methods</title>
<p>Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups. The intervention group received waiver of patient out-of-pocket expenses (eg, co-payments and/or coinsurance) for specified medications and physician visits plus multiple scheduled educational appointments with a pharmacist over a 12-month period. The control group received identical financial incentives but only received printed educational materials about diabetes management at the start of the study and again about 3 months into the study. Medications qualifying for co-payment, coinsurance, or deductible waiver included diabetes-related prescription medications and supplies and medications to treat hypertension and dyslipidemias associated with diabetes. In order to blind study participants with respect to the study groups, descriptions of the study groups in both the initial recruitment materials and informed consent form were purposely vague. Participants were told they would have lower out-of-pocket expenses (eg, reduced co-payments and/or coinsurance) and that they would receive education about diabetes. Once consent had been obtained and the patient randomized, the patient was given further details about the waiver of out-of-pocket expenses and about the educational benefit he or she would receive. At no time was a patient told by the research staff what the other group received with respect to out-of-pocket expenses or educational benefits. The study (including the blinding approach) was approved by the Oregon State University (OSU) Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the Peace Health Medical Center IRB (Eugene, Oregon) and was registered with Clinical Trials.Gov.<sup>

<sec id="section3-0897190011418513">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>In all, 5 Oregon employers and 2 Oregon-based health insurance carriers (insurers) collaborated with the OSU/Oregon Health &amp; Science University College of Pharmacy (CoP) to initiate the EMPOWER Project. In all, 3 employers (cities of Eugene and Springfield and Lane County) participated in years 1 and 2 and others (city of Corvallis and Bethel School District) in year 2. One of the employers (city of Springfield) was self-insured but used an insurer for claims processing. Each of the other 4 employers was fully insured through 1 of the 2 carriers. Individuals were eligible for participation if they were (1) employed by (or listed as medical insurance beneficiary of) a participating employer, (2) diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, (3) of age 18 years or older, and (4) willing and able to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy-related diabetes and inability to converse and read materials in English.</p>
<p>Employers assisted with recruitment by mailing explanatory letters about the study inviting employees and insured family members, including women and minorities, to participate if appropriate. Employers posted similar information on work site bulletin boards and internal Web sites. To maintain employee confidentiality, communications from employers were directed to all employees and instructed interested individuals who thought they might qualify to contact the study team directly for further information. In addition, the insurers mailed invitation letters addressed only to beneficiaries likely to have diabetes. Staff from the insurance carriers worked with CoP research personnel to establish criteria to identify those beneficiaries using <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) diagnosis codes and reimbursement claims for diabetes-related medications/supplies. The study team did not have access to the names of these employees. Recruitment materials from both the employers and insurers included a toll-free telephone number to call the research study nurse (J.A.L.) to learn more about the study and how to enroll.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190011418513">
<title>Study Visits</title>
<p>The study nurse responded to the initial employee inquiries, assisted with enrollment, met with patients at the beginning and end of the study, and responded to subject questions throughout the course of the project. She explained the study over the phone and, if the beneficiary qualified and was interested, scheduled an appointment for the first study visit. Study visits with the study nurse or another clinician from the study team were held in a clinic examination room not associated with the study pharmacies or the employers. At that initial visit, the beneficiaries gave informed consent and were randomized to either the intervention or control group. The study team member also obtained blood pressure, weight, and waist circumference measurements; administered standardized questionnaires and surveys as described below; and assisted patients randomized to the intervention group (pharmacist patient counseling) in selection of a convenient participating pharmacist. After the patient selected their pharmacist, confirmatory letters were sent to the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient’s primary care physician. Control-group participants were provided written educational information about managing diabetes. Additional educational information was mailed to control patients about 3 months later. All patients were scheduled for entry laboratory testing (A1c, serum glucose, and lipid panel). Laboratory tests were performed at 1 of 2 centralized laboratories (Oregon Medical Laboratory or Samaritan Health System Laboratory Services).</p>
<p>After 12 months, the research staff contacted each participant to schedule a second study visit to obtain post study blood pressure readings, weight, and waist circumference measurements; readminister the standardized questionnaires and surveys; and request an end-of-study laboratory visit. The data collected from these 2 study visits were the primary source of evaluation for research purposes and were not made available to the pharmacists for patient care decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190011418513">
<title>Pharmacists and Services Provided</title>
<p>All licensed pharmacists in the geographic areas of the participating employers were invited to participate by way of a letter from the CoP. Further explanation was given to those who expressed interest via phone and informational meetings. Participating pharmacists signed a formal agreement with the CoP outlining the procedures of the study, responsibilities of the pharmacist, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) agreements with the insurers, and an informed consent document approved by the OSU IRB. They had to show documentation of prior certification as a diabetes educator or complete 16 continuing-education hours of online diabetes education developed by the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) and the National Institute for Pharmacist Care Outcomes (NIPCO) credentialing program.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011418513">9</xref>
</sup> Participating pharmacists were also required to attend an additional 14 hours of didactic and case-based workshops that were coordinated by the study investigators. The workshops included a strong emphasis on patient education and empowerment, clinical intervention techniques, patient care documentation, and billing procedures for counseling services. Additionally, participating pharmacists were required to have a private patient-counseling area (as confirmed by a study-team member site visit). During the first phase of the study, 17 pharmacists representing chain pharmacies, independent pharmacies, and a medical clinic participated. In all, 2 pharmacists left the study requiring reassignment of several patients in year 1. For the second employer group, 5 more pharmacists were trained, though only 2 were assigned patients.</p>
<p>Patients and pharmacists agreed to make appointments to meet monthly for the first 3 months and every 1 to 3 months thereafter (less frequently as patients improved on self-management). While pharmacists were instructed on methods and protocols for gathering patient information, educating and coaching patients with diabetes, and documenting outcomes, they were not required to use specific educational or clinical practice protocols. They were requested to fax, e-mail, or mail a progress note to the patient’s primary care physician after each visit, but this was not always done nor was reimbursement based on this being accomplished. A study team member conducted site visits to obtain overall feedback regarding how the pharmacist felt the visits with their patients were going, to ascertain whether patient appointments were being kept and to determine whether pharmacists were generally following the requirements for participation. No attempt was made to intervene in patient care or critique pharmacist performance. Laboratory and physical assessment data from the pharmacist visits was not collected by the investigators. Pharmacists used specific Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (assigned by the insurance companies) to bill insurers for completed appointments at a rate of $80 for an initial 60-minute visit and $40 for a 30-minute follow-up visit. Additional visit time was documented in 15-minute increments. It was not necessary for patients to have prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy where their pharmacist educator was located. A uniquely coded identifier card was given to all patients that allowed them to receive prescriptions without co-payment/coinsurance for covered medications (diabetic drugs, diabetic supplies, hypertensive drugs, and lipid-lowering drugs) at any pharmacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0897190011418513">
<title>Study Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary study outcome was the change in A1c between the first and second study visits (1 year). Other laboratory measures were used as secondary outcomes and included total, low-density lipoprotein ([LDL] estimated by the Friedewald equation), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; triglycerides; total-to-HDL ratio; and fasting blood glucose. These laboratory values were measured at the central laboratories within a few days of each study visit. Other clinical parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, and BMI) were also assessed at both study visits.</p>
<p>Insurance claims data were provided by the health insurance companies of each employer. Claims were grouped into a baseline year (starting 12 months before the month of the first study visit) and study year (beginning with the month of the first study visit). Claims were grouped into the following categories: diabetes medications (oral hypoglycemic, insulin, and other glucose-lowering agents); diabetes supplies (syringes, needles, glucose test strips, and machines); antihypertensive medications; dyslipidemia medications; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I); all other medications; diabetes-related medical care (physician visits, laboratory testing, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations); and all other nondiabetes-related medical care. Each medication reported in the claims data was classified into one of the above categories based on a pharmacist’s review. Medical claims were classified into diabetes-related claims and nondiabetes-related claims using the primary diagnosis code associated with the encounter and blinded review of hospital claims by 2 members of the study team. The number of pharmacist-counseling visits a patient had with a study pharmacist was determined both by reviewing the pharmacist’s records and by claims data. Data on sick leave was collected from the employers for all employees for the year of the study (starting in the month of the first study visit) and for the prior year. Sick leave for study participants was abstracted. However, the 2 employers with the greatest number of study participants did not distinguish between sick leave and vacation leave. Since sick leave could not be separated from vacation leave for these participants, sick leave data are available on only a small number of participants. Absolute and relative absenteeism and presenteeism were assessed using a standardized instrument, the World Health Organization (WHO) Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (also known as HPQ) that contains 9 questions about amount of time worked or missed and the levels of performance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011418513">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011418513"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011418513">12</xref>
</sup> These data were requested from all subjects who worked outside of the home.</p>
<p>Several humanistic outcomes were also assessed. The Diabetes Empowerment scale (DES)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011418513">13</xref>
</sup> includes 28 questions which yield an overall DES score and 3 subscales (managing the psychosocial aspects of diabetes, assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change, and setting and achieving diabetes goals) with higher scores associated with greater diabetes empowerment. Four additional questions from the DES “Long Form”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011418513">14</xref>
</sup> (described in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0897190011418513">Appendix A</xref>) were also assessed as descriptive variables. The Diabetes Knowledge Test (DKT) has 23 questions (14 general ones and 9 for insulin users) and is scored on a percentage basis for each set of questions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011418513">15</xref>
</sup> The Adherence Starts with Knowledge (ASK-20) medication adherence instrument has 20 questions that yields a total medication barrier score (a higher score indicates more barriers).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011418513">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190011418513">17</xref>
</sup> These surveys were administered at each of the study visits. Individual questions about quality of care during the study and about whether an individual believed he or she was in the intervention group or the control group was assessed only at the final study visit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0897190011418513">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Required sample size was estimated for A1c change scores (primary outcome). The expected mean (standard deviation) for these scores were –1.11% (2.1%) from the Asheville Study at 1 year (Carole Cranor, personal communication, December 2004). Assuming that a waiver of out-of-pocket expenses would reduce the hemoglobin A1c by 0.30%, a sample size of 109 enrollees completing 12 months would be required to detect a between-group difference of 0.80% with 80% power and a 2-sided 5% significance level. Assuming 25% of enrollees would drop out before the final study visit, a sample size of 150 patients per group was targeted.</p>
<p>Baseline data were summarized descriptively. For each variable, the change score (final visit minus initial visit) was compared (1) between the study groups with and without adjusting for baseline and (2) to zero for each study group separately. The adjusted between-group analyses were analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline or previous year as the covariate. The unadjusted analyses were 2-sample <italic>t</italic> tests or Wilcoxcon rank sum tests. The within-group analyses were paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The Wilcoxon tests were used for Likert scales and for data with skewness coefficients &lt;−1 or &gt;1. For claims data, the change scores were for the study year minus the previous year. Baseline summaries for variables with limited distributions (eg, small numbers of patients with specific comorbidities) and analyses with no significant differences are not discussed in this article. Results are available upon request from the authors.</p>
<p>While this is a randomized trial, the small sample size of 67 patients and the inclusion of spouses with diabetes into the same treatment group the initial study enrollee resulted in some baseline characteristic differences between the groups. In order to control the potential confounding variables in the analyses, several analyses were undertaken. Given the relatively small sample size, a full propensity score analysis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011418513">18</xref>
</sup> using matching approaches was impractical. Graphical comparisons of the distribution of each baseline characteristic between 2 study groups identified 17 variables for which there were apparent differences between the groups. Statistical tests (Pearson chi-square test for binomial characteristics and 2-independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for numeric characteristics) were then performed to compare these baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. ANCOVA models were fit for each potential confounding variable for which the baseline characteristics for which the between-group comparison <italic>P</italic> value was ≤.25. A second set of analyses included estimating propensity scores<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011418513">18</xref>
</sup> using the same set of potential confounders. One ANCOVA was fit that included the estimated propensity scare as a covariate and a second ANCOVA model was fit-restricted to patients with estimated propensity scores in the “middle” of the distribution of propensity scores. The latter analysis ignores ranges of propensity scores for which 1 treatment arm is represented by only 1 or 2 patients. These analyses were performed for A1c (the primary outcome) and for HDL cholesterol.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 5 employers participated in this study; 3 in the first year of the study and 2 in the second year. Of 69 patients who signed informed consent, 2 (1 in each group) withdrew shortly after the study began (with no follow-up information). This report summarizes 36 intervention-group patients and 31 control-group patients. Demographic and other baseline characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011418513">Table 1</xref>
. The proportion of females was somewhat higher in the control group, but the groups were otherwise well balanced. The mean number of visits to a pharmacist over the 12-month study period in the intervention group was 5.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6, 6.3) with mean reimbursement to pharmacists of $225 (CI: $178, $272). Pharmacists, on average, reported 0.5 visits more than were accounted for in the claims data, suggesting that some interactions were not billed to the insurer.</p>

For the restricted analysis, the 25 patients with propensity scores between 0.30 and 0.75 were included in an ANCOVA model. Of 28 patients (6 in the control group) with propensity scores &lt;0.30 and 11 patients (all in the intervention group) with propensity scores &gt;0.75 were excluded from this analysis. The estimated, least-square mean changes in A1c from baseline to follow-up were +0.29% in the intervention group and −0.38% in the intervention group.

<p>There was no between-group difference for rating quality of diabetes care received during the year of the study (<italic>P</italic> = .197). When asked whether an individual felt he or she were in the control or intervention group of the study, 54% of respondents in the control group indicated they were in the control group while 75% of respondents in the intervention group indicated “unable to tell” (<italic>P</italic> = .0076).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While this clinical trial did not accrue its targeted sample size, the difference in change in A1c still approached statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .0757) with a significant decrease in the intervention group (−0.50 %, 95% CI: −0.80%, −0.20%) but not in the control group (−0.17%, CI: −0.59%, 0.26%). The only other significant clinical change was the unanticipated and unexplained decrease in HDL cholesterol in both of the study groups (the groups did not differ). Mean annual costs for claims related to diabetes medications ($450 and $516, respectively, in the intervention and control groups), diabetic supplies ($191 and $237), antihypertensive ($140 and $46), and dyslipidemic ($197 and $195) medications significantly increased over the study period in both groups. Between-group differences in these costs were not statistically significant due to the small sample size and large variations in costs. Total medical claims (combined physician visits, diagnostic and laboratory testing, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) rose in both groups. Mean nondiabetes-related medical costs were higher (not statistically significantly so) in the intervention group ($10 800) than in the control group ($2040). In the intervention group, there were more hospitalizations during the study year (5) than in the year prior to the study (1). In the control group, there was 1 hospitalization during the study year and 1 during the year prior to the study. However, none of these hospitalizations had a primary diagnosis code of diabetes. Excluding these hospitalizations reduced the increase in nondiabetes medical costs but did not remove the difference between the groups. Given the small sample size, however, these could be due to chance alone.</p>
<p>We identified several interesting changes in humanistic outcomes. There was a significant improvement from baseline in the intervention group with respect to the overall DES, Dissatisfaction/Readiness to Change (DES), self-rated understanding of diabetes, fitting diabetes into one’s life in a positive manner, and the general knowledge test (for those who used insulin at baseline). The change from baseline was significant in both groups with respect to managing the psychosocial aspects of diabetes. These results suggest that patients in the intervention group tended to feel more empowered and have greater knowledge about diabetes and its management following the intervention.</p>
<p>Based on the analyses using potential confounding variables, individually or as a propensity score, there is little evidence that the observed difference in change scores for A1c is due to confounding as this observed difference in mean change score changed little across adjusted analyses. Thus, baseline differences did not seem to be important confounders for A1c in this study. Similarly, there was no evidence that the mean changes in HDL cholesterol were impacted by potential confounders (results not shown).</p>
<p>The EMPOWER clinical results may be compared to results from the first year of the Asheville Study,<sup>

</sup> All studies demonstrated improved A1c levels in patients who received individualized counseling sessions with their pharmacist on a regular basis and, with the exception of Fremantle, some combination of financial incentives (waived co-pays for selected medications). With respect to A1c, the Asheville and PSMP studies had greater reductions in A1c (1.1% and 0.8%, respectively) than the other 3 studies (0.4% to 0.5%; intervention arms only for Fremantle and Empower). However, these 2 early studies also had higher baseline A1c values. HDL concentrations decreased in both Empower groups (4-6 mg/dL) and were relatively steady in the Fremantle study (0.8-2.1 mg/dL decrease). HDL cholesterol statistical analyses have not been performed for the DTCC (Toni Fera, personal communication, November 2009). Changes in other clinical parameters in Empower were not statistically significant and were similar to changes in other studies.</p>

</sup> all reported increased pharmacy-related expenses (27%-62%) associated with both pharmacist counseling and increased medication claims costs. The increase in medication-related costs may be related to improved access because of removal of financial barriers and/or improved medication adherence because of education by the pharmacist. Most studies showed a decrease in medical claims (8%-41%) and a decrease or slight increase (−26% to +9%) in total claims. The intervention group in the Empower study is an outlier; the increases during the study year were 128% and 143% for medical and total claims. These increases were primarily in nondiabetes-related claims; there were virtually no changes in diabetes-related medical care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190011418513">Table 3</xref>). While part of these increases is due to a very few patients with catastrophic illness (eg, cancer and surgeries), we cannot fully explain this disparity. However, due to both the small sample size and the large variability in costs, these differences in changes from baseline within the 2 EMPOWER study groups and the comparison of the study groups did not achieve statistical significance. That is, these differences, while large, are consistent with chance variations.</p>
<p>Unlike the Asheville, PSMP, and DTCC studies, the EMPOWER study included a control group of patients who received no pharmacist counseling but received financial incentives identical to the intervention group along with printed educational materials about diabetes. Thus, the control group was not representative of a “usual-care” diabetic population; the financial incentives may have improved medication adherence and the educational materials may have improved disease understanding. Patients in this control group showed a small, statistically nonsignificant improvement (0.16%) in A1c levels which was less than observed in the intervention group (0.50%). These 2 enhancements to the pharmacy drug benefit are increasingly being offered by many third-party payers as part of disease management programs.</p>
<p>Another potential difference between EMPOWER and the other US studies was the oversight of the participating pharmacists by the study investigators. All studies provided pre-study training of the pharmacists, but there was more oversight of the pharmacists during the course of the Asheville study. In the EMPOWER project, members of the research team periodically visited study pharmacies for general oversight but did not require the use of consistent clinical protocols nor collect patient data from the pharmacist and did not intervene in patient care decisions. This was done to simulate the environment most likely to be encountered during usual care in community pharmacies. An observation by the investigators was that some pharmacists and pharmacies were more comfortable than others with the patient interactions and were more efficient in arranging staffing and scheduling to counsel their patients.</p>
<p>With respect to limitations, this study was primarily limited by its reduced statistical power due to the small sample size. The proportion of beneficiaries who volunteered for this study was less than anticipated; 15% to 20% of those identified by the insurers as having diabetes participated compared to an anticipated rate of 50%. Those who volunteered may have differed from the rest of those with diabetes (eg, been more proactive about their diabetes or better able to “confront” this condition). The relatively low baseline A1c values in EMPOWER compared to the other US studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0897190011418513">Table 5</xref>) support the idea that this group of study participants may have been very different from the average diabetic in this population. Because this was an “opt-in” program and promoted to potential subjects as a research study instead of being a fixed benefit, those with a greater interest in managing their disease may have been motivated to apply. The blinding of study participants was clearly not complete in this study. The research team is aware that employees of one employer talked among themselves and with their human resource manager about the study and thus blinding was doubtful among this subgroup. Given the difficulty of blinding an intervention like this, future studies may be better off randomizing groups of beneficiaries (eg, employers or geographic locations) rather than individual beneficiaries. The proportion of females differed somewhat between the 2 study groups. When statistical analyses of all clinical outcomes were performed to adjust for gender, there was no change in the results suggesting gender was not a confounder.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study supports, but does not provide clear evidence for, the premise that pharmacist counseling for health care plan beneficiaries with diabetes results in better disease control and improved empowerment to better self-manage this disease. A randomized study that is powered and achieves its targeted sample size is still needed to validate the value of pharmacist counseling.</p>

Introduction</title> <p>Rotary machines and components such as bearings, shafts, gears, and rotors, to name just a few, are widely used in industry. These machines and components often work under very harsh environments such as high load, high temperature, high moisture, dusty areas, etc. As a result, they suffer from health condition degradation in the form of ageing, fatigue, cracking, breaking, and corrosion, among others. Unexpected breakdown of these components often causes damage to the system, extended downtime and extensive economic loss. Therefore, it is often important to monitor these systems and evaluate their health condition in real-time autonomously while they are in operation. The online real-time monitoring also enables the transition from time/usage-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance (CBM). Although CBM is cost-effective, it requires advanced modeling and estimation techniques to acquire information about a system's health condition. Since most faults in the system, such as a bearing, cannot be measured directly, an effective CBM solution relies on the available measurements from bearing to estimate health condition. To this end, detailed and completed knowledge of a bearing is needed. However, such knowledge is often difficult to obtain, and this severely hinders the implementation and deployment of CBM.</p> <p>When bearings are in operation, contact between rolling elements and surfaces such as inner raceways and outer raceways generates time-varying force. The time-varying force results in vibration even for bearings that are brand new and geometrically perfect. The vibration signals can be measured by different sensors, such as accelerometers, acoustic emission sensors and ultrasonic sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311422241">Braun, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311422241">Chiementin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311422241">Howard, 1994</xref>). When a fault occurs in a bearing, the fault will induce force and cause the change of these signals. Therefore, these signals in one way or another indicate the health condition of the bearing. In general, vibration signals collected from accelerometers are extensively used in condition monitoring because they have an advantage over those from other sensors in wide dynamic and frequency range. For this reason, the studies of the vibration signal play important roles in understanding the system, detecting system fault, and planning optimal maintenance, and they have attracted attention from academic researchers and manufacturers over the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311422241">Ayhan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311422241">Bechhoefer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311422241">Chiementin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077546311422241">Ho and Randall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311422241">Howard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077546311422241">Keller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077546311422241">Khoshnoud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077546311422241">Marichal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077546311422241">McFadden and Smith, 1984</xref>; Randall et al., 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077546311422241">Suggs and Wade, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077546311422241">Wang and Kootsookos, 1998</xref>).</p> <p>For an ideal bearing with no fault and a steady load, the force between two contact surfaces is relatively stable and the vibration signal collected from accelerometers is stable. The accelerometers are often mounted on a framework close to the component under monitoring. When a defect occurs in this component, an uneven force appears and this uneven force produces an impulse one or several times in each revolution. This series of impulses, in most cases, will excite resonance in the component and bearing itself. The number of impulses per revolution and the frequency of resonance are often determined by the location of the fault, the geometry of the component, etc. The frequency of vibration excited by faults is termed as fault characteristic frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311422241">Howard, 1994</xref>). Therefore, the components appear at the fault characteristic frequency and its harmonics are vital for fault detection, isolation and accurate fault dimension estimation. This information is critical to ensure bearing safety, reliability and optimal maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311422241">Howard, 1994</xref>).</p> <p>In this paper, a bearing vibration model is developed in which a fault mode can be injected. To simplify the modeling, the structure of the model is given so that the main effort will be on the determination of model parameters. The model parameters are determined based on experimental data with a known system load and fault dimension. To achieve this goal, a genetic-algorithm-based optimization method is introduced to minimize the difference of model output and real measurement. Since fault characteristic frequency and its harmonics are most related to fault and fault-induced force, the real measurements are processed so that only these fault-related components are preserved. After the model is trained, it runs in parallel with the system for real-time estimation of fault dimension. The estimated fault dimension suffers from noise and unknown disturbances from the system. To address this problem an extended Kalman filter is used to improve the performance of fault dimension estimation. The entire solution is verified on experimental data and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p> <p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-1077546311422241">Section 2</xref> introduces the proposed approach for modeling and online system health condition monitoring. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-1077546311422241">Section 3</xref> briefly summarizes the algorithms used for optimization and estimation to make the paper self-contained. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec7-1077546311422241">Section 4</xref> presents a case study on a rolling element bearing vibration modeling and fault dimension estimation.

Proposed approach for vibration modeling and online fault estimation</title> <p>Due to varying operating conditions, loading, and manufacturing defects etc., the fault development and progression often show very different behaviors even for two different systems/components with exactly the same configuration. In addition, it is often very difficult to obtain real fault dimension measurement for a critical component from the beginning of service (fault dimension is zero) to the end of its life. In many experiments, however, the fault is injected manually. This way, the fault dimension can be controlled. When the component with the injected fault is in service, it is expected that the measurement from this system, such as vibration, will be very close to the signal from a real system under the same operating mode with the same fault dimension. This assumption is widely accepted by many researchers implicitly or explicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311422241">Chiementin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077546311422241">McFadden and Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077546311422241">Wang and Kootsookos, 1998</xref>).</p> <p>With this assumption, a set of data with known operating conditions (including system load, environment temperature and humidity, etc) from the system of interest with a known fault dimension can be obtained. With this set of data, many approaches can be applied to build a system model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311422241">Bai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077546311422241">Hashemi and Kargarnovin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077546311422241">Saravanan et al., 2009</xref>). For data-driven modeling and estimation approaches, it is favorable to collect as much data as possible to maximize the performance of the proposed method. However, fault injection often induces high cost. In addition, it is often labor intensive because it usually requires disassembly and reinstallation of the system. For this reason, the dataset with injected faults is usually small and may not reflect the system behavior under a real-world fault that shows a continuous growth of fault size. The difficulties in obtaining real-world data motivate the proposed work to design a suitable model that represents with a certain level of fidelity the vibration from rotary machines or components. With such a model, fault can be injected to obtain simulation data in an inexpensive and safe way.</p> <p>There are many published works on system modeling. Some of them are based on finite element analysis, which has the advantage of accuracy and the disadvantage of a time-consuming and heavy computing load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077546311422241">Kiral and Karagulle, 2003</xref>). Some theoretical models based on partial differential equations are also available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311422241">Antoni and Randall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077546311422241">Brie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077546311422241">Ericsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077546311422241">Li and Shin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077546311422241">McFadden and Smith, 1984</xref>). The advantage of these kinds of models is that they have a very solid physical meaning. The limitation is that the system is often working in a complicated and varying environment; there are many uncertainties; and disturbance cannot be included in the model. In addition, there are often some parameters that need to be determined. The selection of suitable and good parameters requires extensive knowledge about the system. Inappropriately selected parameters will always impair the accuracy and fidelity of the model.</p> <p>To overcome these limitations, many data-driven modeling methods are introduced to develop the model alone or to enhance the theoretical modeling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077546311422241">Brie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077546311422241">Ericsson et al., 2005</xref>). The data-driven methods, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, regression etc., have the advantages of establishing a nonlinear model and capturing the main signature in the data. The limitation is that statistically sufficient data must be available. As mentioned above, the dataset from a seeded fault experiment is often small. There are some research works on achieving efficient system training for a small dataset, which is beyond the topic of this paper. In this paper, our focus is on the topic of vibration modeling based on recorded data, which is an offline training process, and real-time fault dimension estimation, which is an online implementing process.</p> <p>It has been established that a fault will excite resonance at a certain frequency. This frequency and its harmonics, and/or sidebands around these frequencies have a direct relationship with fault dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311422241">Howard, 1994</xref>). Based on this idea, a vibration modeling scheme is proposed and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311422241">Figure 1</xref>. In this figure, real data are from experiments where load and fault dimensions are known. After a Fourier transform, characteristic fault frequencies are identified. By removing frequency components at other frequencies and conducting an Inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT), the signal with only fault characteristic frequency components is obtained. This process is also called cliff filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077546311422241">Plotnik and Longman, 1999</xref>). Meanwhile, the known load and fault dimension are also sent to a vibration model which has a given model structure. The output of the vibration model is a time domain signal that contains frequency components of fault characteristic frequencies and its harmonics. The processed signals from the real measurement are divided into training set (study set) and test set. In the training step, the simulated data from the model are compared against the data in the training set. The difference between them is utilized to adjust the model parameters. For a set of parameters, when error from all training data reach a given threshold and the error from all testing data reach a comparable accuracy, the parameters can be regarded as an optimal set and the model as a high fidelity one. <fig id="fig1-1077546311422241" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Scheme of vibration modeling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311422241-fig1.tif"/></fig></p> <p>When a model is established, it can be used to estimate real-time fault dimension as an observer. For the system in service, fault dimension continuously grows after a fault occurs. For CBM purposes, it is desirable to estimate the growth of fault dimension in real time. That is, it is desirable to estimate the existence of the fault and the dimension of the fault.</p> <p>To achieve this goal, an online fault dimension estimation scheme is proposed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311422241">Figure 2</xref>. In this figure, the load that applied to the real system with an unknown fault is also applied to the vibration model. The inputs of this model also include an initial fault dimension. For a brand new system, the initial fault dimension is zero. Then, the fault dimension is adjusted online according to the system output to reach accurate fault estimation. With the fact that the fault dimension in most systems grows slowly, the online fault dimension estimation can be realized. As with the training process, the outputs of the real system and the vibration model are Fourier transformed to obtain the spectra at the fault characteristic frequencies and their harmonics. The spectra at other frequencies are removed because the fault has little effect on them. The two processed frequency domain signals are then inversely transformed to get two time-domain signals. The error between these two filtered signals is then minimized to adjust the fault dimension. When the error reaches a given threshold, the estimated fault dimension is regarded as an estimation of the real fault dimension. Note that the estimation is quite noisy in most cases and, therefore, an extended Kalman filter is used to achieve an accurate estimation. Finally, the estimated fault dimension is sent to a decision-making unit to schedule the maintenance practice. <fig id="fig2-1077546311422241" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Scheme of online fault dimension estimation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311422241-fig2.tif"/></fig></p> </sec> <sec id="sec3-1077546311422241"><title>3. Training algorithm</title> <sec id="sec4-1077546311422241"><title>3.1. Genetic algorithm</title> <p>A genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal parameters of vibration model. The objective is to minimize the error between the constructed model output and the processed real measurements. As mentioned earlier, the dataset is divided into study set and test set. The optimal parameter set should generate comparable error on both study and test sets to avoid overtraining, which will cause degradation of performance on the test set. To prevent overtraining, the objective function is defined as a sum of error on both study and test sets and it is desirable to put more emphasis on the test set. To this end, an objective (or fitness) function is defined as follows: <disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1077546311422241"><label>(1)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block" id="mml-disp1-1077546311422241"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>min</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mtable align="left"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="center" columnspan="1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="center" columnspan="1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-1077546311422241" xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311422241-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula> where <italic>y<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>y<sub>t</sub></italic> are processed measurements, which contain only the fault characteristic frequency and its harmonic components, on the study set and the test set, respectively; <italic>y<sub>m</sub></italic> the model output, <italic>N<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>t</sub></italic> the number of data in the study and test sets; 0 ≤ <italic>α<sub>s</sub></italic> ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ <italic>α<sub>t</sub></italic> ≤ 1 the weighting factors of error on the study and test sets, respectively, with <italic>α<sub>s</sub></italic> + <italic>α<sub>t</sub></italic> = 1.

Extended Kalman filtering</title> <p>In practice, the fault dimension grows slowly and monotonically in a smooth way before it reaches a breaking point. However, the vibration signal measured from the system contains noise and disturbances and so it is the estimated fault dimension from the proposed method. Therefore, it is necessary to filter the estimated fault dimension before utilizing it in a decision-making unit. An extended Kalman filter is used for this purpose. The reason of using an extended Kalman filter is that the fault usually progresses in a nonlinear way.</p> <p>To realize a Kalman filter, a fault progression model is needed. To this end, a Paris' law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311422241">Bechhoefer, 2008</xref>) is developed because most fatigue-induced mechanical faults obey this law. The Paris’ law requires the relationship between fault dimension/load and the stress in the system that is hard to attain. Therefore, the Paris’ law is modified and the fault progression model is written as follows: <disp-formula id="disp-formula7-1077546311422241"><label>(7)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block" id="mml-disp7-1077546311422241"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula7-1077546311422241" xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311422241-eq7.tif"/></disp-formula> <disp-formula id="disp-formula8-1077546311422241"><label>(8)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block" id="mml-disp8-1077546311422241"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula8-1077546311422241" xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311422241-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula> where <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q</italic> are material-related parameters, <italic>w</italic> and <italic>v</italic> noise subject to normal distribution <italic>N</italic>(0,<italic>Q</italic>) and <italic>N</italic>(0, <italic>R</italic>), respectively.

Online health condition monitoring</title> <p>With the developed model serving as an observer, the fault dimension for a real system can be monitored. As mentioned above, the assumption is that the measurement from the real-time system with a fault is very close to the experimental result with the same fault dimension.</p> <p>To initialize a fault in a bearing quickly and easily, a very small initial fault is seeded on the outer raceway. To accelerate the growth of the fault, a load that equals the rated maximum load is applied to the bearing. The actual fault size is measured at three time instances. To gain a smooth growth curve of fault progression, the fault size measured at the three discrete time instants are interpolated using a linear method. The interpolation result is a smooth curve that is regarded as actual fault progression. To match the estimated fault size with the actual fault size, they are scaled in the range between 0 and 1. Note that 0 corresponds to the initial fault size which is equal to 528.7 square microns, while 1 is the final measurement fault size, which is equal to 40048.6 square microns. The estimate of the fault size is carried out every hour of service time and in total there are 68 values of estimation in this experiment. In the estimation, because fault size could not be a negative value, it is has to be larger than 0.</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311422241">Figure 7</xref> shows the result of the fault estimation. The interpolated actual real-time fault size is given by the blue curve.

Note that the estimation of fault dimension is scaled with a scaling factor determined by trial and error. <fig id="fig7-1077546311422241" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Results of online health monitoring.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311422241-fig7.tif"/></fig></p> <p>When the proposed scheme is utilized in parallel with real time for online fault dimension estimation, it can be implemented in a time-based pointwise fashion. As we mentioned earlier, the fault growth of most mechanical systems is slow. With this nature, the fault dimension estimation does not need to be implemented at a very high frequency. For example, the proposed method can be used in most real-world systems providing one fault estimation every one minute or sometimes even longer (e.g., 10 minutes) is reasonable for these systems. The modeling module only requires very simple calculation because the model has been established. At every time instance where an estimation of fault is needed, the vibration is recorded for a short time span (e.g. a few seconds). Then the proposed scheme can be applied on this time span to achieve real-time fault estimation. This way, the computation load required can be significantly reduced and the influence on the performance of the system can be reduced as well.</p> </sec> </sec> <sec id="sec12-1077546311422241"><title>5. Conclusion</title> <p>In this paper, a rolling element bearing vibration modeling scheme and a system health monitoring scheme are proposed. The system modeling is composed of vibration analysis and parameter optimization based on a genetic algorithm, which is an offline training process. The online system health monitoring is constructed by using the model with the optimal parameters. The fault dimension is the input to the system model to be determined. By minimizing the error between the model output and the real system, the fault dimension can be estimated. To minimize the influence of noise and disturbances for accurate fault size estimation, an extended Kalman filter is used to filter the fault dimension. The proposed scheme is demonstrated on a case study of a bearing system and results verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme.</p> </sec> </body> <back> <sec id="sec13-1077546311422241"><title>Funding</title> <p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p> </sec> <ref-list> <title>References</title> <ref id="bibr1-1077546311422241"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antoni</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Randall</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2003</year>) <article-title>A stochastic model for simulation and diagnostics of rolling element bearings with localized fault</article-title>. <source>Journal of Vibration and Acoustics</source> <volume>125</volume>: <fpage>282</fpage>–<lpage>289</lpage>.</citation></ref> <ref id="bibr2-1077546311422241"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ayhan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Chow</surname><given-names>M-Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>M-H</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2006</year>) <article-title>Multiple discriminant analysis and neural network based monolith and partition fault detection schemes for broken rotor bar in induction motors</article-title>. <source>IEEE Transactions Industrial Electronics</source> <volume>53</volume>: <fpage>1298</fpage>–<lpage>1308</lpage>.</citation></ref> <ref id="bibr3-1077546311422241"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsiao</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2000</year>) <article-title>Development of an online diagnosis system for rotor vibration via model-based intelligent inference</article-title>. <source>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</source> <volume>107</volume>(<issue>1</issue>): <fpage>315</fpage>–<lpage>323</lpage>.</citation></ref> <ref id="bibr4-1077546311422241"><citation citation-type="other"><comment>Bechhoefer E (2008) A method for generalized prognostics of a component using Paris law.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) corresponds with dysfunction in controlling and managing cognitive processes. Impaired performance is evident in a range of cognitive control strategies including directing attention, inhibiting behaviour, generating strategies, planning, monitoring ongoing performance and coding representations in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004867412461383">Pizzagalli, 2010</xref>). These tasks require higher-level cognitive functions that recruit frontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>) and dysfunction in the frontal lobes has been proposed as a biomarker for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004867412461383">Pizzagalli, 2010</xref>). Neurobiological models have proposed that the depressed state is mediated by reduced dorsolateral prefrontal (cognition) and increased ventrolateral (affect) prefrontal cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004867412461383">Mayberg, 2003</xref>). Indeed, impairments are consistently observed on tasks requiring engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) such as attention (e.g. switching attention) and working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412461383">Austin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004867412461383">Murphy et al., 1999</xref>). Despite disturbances in affect, not all patients display impairment in cognitive control. This is reflected in a range of neuropsychological studies, which have failed to produce consistent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004867412461383">Gorlyn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004867412461383">McClintock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004867412461383">McDermott and Ebmeier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004867412461383">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0004867412461383">Shenal et al., 2003</xref>). These inconsistencies may, in part, relate to a lack of homogeneity in clinical samples. It is possible that cognitive impairment may be specific to more severe depression with biological disturbances such as psychomotor disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004867412461383">Taylor and Fink, 2006</xref>) and reductions in heart rate variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004867412461383">Kemp et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0004867412461383">Thayer et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, the type of cognitive disturbances observed may differ between subtypes of depression, which would support disorder heterogeneity. The current study aims to examine the impact of severity, subtype and symptoms on neuropsychological frontal lobe function in MDD.</p>
<p>Specific neuropsychological deficits have been reported for melancholic patients in comparison to non-melancholic patients on tasks primarily activating the DLPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>), such as working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412461383">Austin et al., 1999</xref>) and attention shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412461383">Austin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004867412461383">Murphy et al., 1999</xref>), but do not differ on tasks associated with the left frontal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>), such as verbal fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412461383">Austin et al., 1999</xref>). This suggests that there may be differences between melancholia and non-melancholia on tasks, which for the most part engage the DLPFC, such as working memory, and attention tasks, such that melancholia exhibits greater dysfunction. Melancholic depression is considered to be distinct from non-melancholia due to the presence of psychomotor disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004867412461383">Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0004867412461383">Schrijvers et al., 2008</xref>). There is also debate over how other symptoms such as anxiety are related to subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004867412461383">Angst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004867412461383">Coryell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004867412461383">Gold and Chrousos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004867412461383">Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0004867412461383">Parker et al., 1995</xref>). Anxiety has been shown to impact upon neuropsychological task performance in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004867412461383">Basso et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, MDD without co-morbid anxiety displays impaired immediate recall of new information but not retrieval or retention of information, whereas MDD with co-morbid anxiety displays impaired recall and recognition memory (immediate and delayed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004867412461383">Kizilbash et al., 2002</xref>) but not working memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004867412461383">Basso et al., 2007</xref>). Verbal memory recall has been associated with the left frontal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004867412461383">Milner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004867412461383">Perret, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004867412461383">Stuss et al., 1998</xref>) and left-sided frontal impairment has been observed in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004867412461383">Davidson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004867412461383">Davidson and Irwin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004867412461383">Heller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004867412461383">Heller and Nitschke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004867412461383">Kemp and Felmingham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004867412461383">Kemp et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004867412461383">Mathersul et al., 2008</xref>). However, increased right frontal activity and reduced right posterior activity has also been found in patients with depression, and this pattern of activity is more prominent in patients with melancholia and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004867412461383">Kemp et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004867412461383">Pizzagalli et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Increased depression severity is also related to greater impairment of neuropsychological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412461383">Austin et al., 1999</xref>). As for co-morbid anxiety, depression severity may also affect cognitive function dependent on which areas of the brain are activated during the task. In a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004867412461383">McDermott and Ebmeier (2009)</xref>, depression severity was related to dysfunction of episodic memory, executive function and processing speed. However, not all results are consistent; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004867412461383">Cataldo et al. (2005)</xref> reported an association between depression severity, executive functioning and processing speed, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004867412461383">Naismith et al. (2003)</xref> reported an association between depression severity, semantic processing and executive functioning, but not processing speed. Furthermore, timed and untimed subsets of cognitive tasks do not differ when it comes to the relationship between depression severity, executive function and processing speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004867412461383">McDermott and Ebmeier, 2009</xref>), indicating processing speed is unaffected by pressure to complete tasks efficiently. Slowed processing speed has been observed as a key indicator of depression, and in particular melancholic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004867412461383">Taylor and Fink, 2006</xref>). While increasing disorder severity generally involves greater biological disturbance, the different cognitive profiles that have been observed in depression may relate, in part, to distinctive subtypes (i.e. melancholic and non-melancholic depression).</p>
<p>The primary aim for the current study was to examine the impact of depression severity, subtype and symptoms on neuropsychological function. A secondary aim of the study was to examine the relationship between subtype (melancholia vs non-melancholia) and anxiety. It was hypothesised that melancholic patients would exhibit poorer performance on working memory and attention tasks. We hypothesise that melancholic symptoms, anxious arousal and psychomotor disturbance will be primary predictors of neuropsychological performance, and impairment on working memory and attention tasks in particular. Furthermore, we expect a greater association between diagnoses of melancholia and anxiety in contrast to non-melancholia. Consistent with this we expect melancholic patients to exhibit increased anxious arousal in contrast to non-melancholic and control participants.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 124 participants with a primary diagnosis of MDD and 124 healthy control participants were recruited from the community in collaboration with the Brain Resource International Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004867412461383">Gordon et al., 2005</xref>). All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council ethical guidelines. Exclusion criteria included a history of brain injury (causing loss of consciousness for 10 minutes or more), neurological disorder, other serious medical condition, or substance abuse or dependence for greater than 1 year. All participants were medication free for at least five half-lives. All depressed participants met the criteria for MDD as determined by trained and supervised research officers using the Mini International Neuropsychological Interview (MINI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0004867412461383">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>), a structured psychiatric interview based on the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004867412461383">APA, 2000</xref>). Depressed participants with co-morbid anxiety were included to maximise the generalisability of the sample. All patient participants had a primary diagnosis of MDD, while some had a variety of secondary diagnoses (generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), <italic>n</italic> = 45; panic disorder, <italic>n</italic> = 29; and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), <italic>n</italic> = 14). Healthy control participants were excluded if they self-reported a history or presence of psychiatric illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0004867412461383">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were identified as either clinical or control participants on the basis of self-report, which was confirmed by structured interview using the MINI. Depression severity was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004867412461383">Hamilton, 1960</xref>) and psychomotor disturbance was measured by the CORE Assessment of Psychomotor Change (CORE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004867412461383">Hickie, 1996</xref>). Patients were diagnosed as melancholic (MEL; <italic>n</italic> = 65) or non-melancholic (NMEL; <italic>n</italic> = 59) on the basis of the MINI. The self-report Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004867412461383">Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995</xref>) were completed by participants at completion of the clinical interview. The depression scale measures anhedonia, dysphoria, hopelessness, worthlessness, demotivation and lack of interest or enthusiasm, consistent with DSM-IV criteria of MDD mood disorders. The anxiety (or anxious arousal) scale measures heightened autonomic arousal and subjective experience of anxious affect (including dryness of mouth, difficulty breathing, pounding heart, sweaty palms), consistent with symptoms observed in panic disorder and PTSD. The stress (or anxious apprehension) scale measures nervous tension, difficulty relaxing and irritability, consistent with GAD. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004867412461383">Mathersul et al. (2008)</xref> for supporting evidence to characterise the DASS anxiety and stress scales as anxious arousal and apprehension, respectively.) These scales, in addition to the CORE, were also used to assess diagnostic validity of participants with melancholic depression, which is considered more severe than non-melancholic depression.</p>
<p>All participants subsequently completed the IntegNeuro, a reliable, valid and standardized neuropsychological test battery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004867412461383">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004867412461383">Kemp et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004867412461383">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004867412461383">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0004867412461383">Paul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004867412461383">Williams et al., 2005</xref>). The cognitive tests were administered using pre-recorded task instructions (via headphones). After a computerized visual demonstration, participants completed a practice task prior to commencing the task. Responses were given via a touch screen computer or WAV files for spoken answers. If a participant failed the test trial, the task instructions were repeated and elaborated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0004867412461383">
<title>Cognitive measures</title>
<p>Selected tasks chosen for analyses reflect those known to draw upon frontal lobe function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004867412461383">Picton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004867412461383">Pizzagalli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>) and include directing attention, inhibiting behaviour, generating strategies, planning, monitoring ongoing performance and coding representations in working memory. These functions encompassing domains of language, attention, memory and executive functioning were chosen in order to clarify the impact of arousal and psychomotor disturbance on cognitive control. The Spot the Real Word Test was also included to provide an estimate of premorbid intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0004867412461383">Yuspeh and Vanderploeg, 2000</xref>) to screen for possible outliers, which may confound results. Measures included the following tests.</p>
<sec id="section10-0004867412461383">
<title>The Word Generation Test</title>
<p>This test is a form of letter fluency test, which is an adaptation of the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004867412461383">Benton and Hamsher, 1989</xref>). The letter fluency test involves naming as many words as possible, in the space of a minute, which begin with the letters F, A and S. Participants are instructed not to use proper nouns or make variations on the same word stem. The measure taken is the average number of words produced for the three letters. The test assesses semantic knowledge and language. It engages a cognitive control strategy involving the monitoring of information and is associated with function in the left frontal lobe and the medial frontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004867412461383">Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0004867412461383">
<title>The Verbal Recall and Recognition Task</title>
<p>This task assesses verbal learning and memory encoding, memory retrieval and recognition, and involves similar processes to that of the California Verbal Learning Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0004867412461383">Tombaugh and Hubley, 2001</xref>) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning and Memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004867412461383">Geffen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004867412461383">Rey, 1964</xref>). In this task, participants are presented with a list of 12 words which they are asked to memorize and recall after each presentation. Words are between four and seven characters in length and closely matched on concreteness, number of letters and frequency. After four trials a distracter list is given (trial 5) and a further two trials are completed utilizing the original list. Measures include the total number of words recalled from trials 1 to 4, the number of words recalled from the original list (trials 1–4) in trial 5 (intrusions), and the number of words recalled correctly in trials 6 (immediate recall) and 7 (delayed recall). Trials 6 and 7 were test trials relying on the learning of the original list during trials 1–4. The task engages cognitive control strategies of monitoring and has been associated with the left frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004867412461383">Milner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004867412461383">Perret, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004867412461383">Stuss et al., 1998</xref>), except for trial 5 (measuring intrusions), which engages monitoring as well as inhibition and has been associated with the right DLPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0004867412461383">Stuss et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0004867412461383">
<title>The Time Estimation Task</title>
<p>This task requires participants to indicate the length of time (in seconds) a black circle takes to change colour (green). The response is indicated via the touch screen providing numbers from 1 through to 12 representing the number of seconds in a sequence across the screen. Twelve trials are completed. A bias in timing is estimated from the absolute value of the average difference between the actual duration of the stimulus and the participant’s estimate weighted by the length of the stimulus. Measures include the bias in time estimation and also the standard deviation of this bias for each participant per trial. This task measures the capacity to assess time and requires the ability to direct attention whilst engaging the DLPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004867412461383">Dias et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004867412461383">Fletcher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004867412461383">Owen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004867412461383">Petrides et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004867412461383">Reukert and Grafman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004867412461383">Rogers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0004867412461383">Wilkins et al., 1987</xref>).</p>

<p>Melancholia was associated with the diagnosis of comorbid anxiety (χ<sup>2</sup> (2) = 8.116, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), such that 77% of patients with melancholic depression also had a comorbid anxiety disorder in contrast to 47% of patients with non-melancholic depression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study examined the impact of subtype, severity and symptoms on cognitive control functions. Patients with melancholia displayed poorer performance on working memory relative to patients with non-melancholia (variability in timing bias, span of visual memory) and controls (variability in timing bias, span of visual memory, reverse digit span), while patients with non-melancholia displayed immediate, short-term delayed memory recall deficits (verbal memory recall), highlighting distinctive impairments. We also observed anxious arousal and psychomotor disturbance to contribute to specific neuropsychological impairments such that higher levels of anxious arousal predicted poorer performance on measures of reverse digit span, executive maze and memory intrusions. Finally, a stronger relationship was revealed between comorbid anxiety and melancholia than for non-melancholia. Strengths of the study include a relatively large sample size, a medication-free sample, control for age, sex, education level and IQ, and the use of a validated observer-rated measure of psychomotor disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004867412461383">Hickie, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients with melancholia displayed more variance in time estimation, and poorer span of visual memory, relative to patients with non-melancholia and controls, reflecting deficits in directing attention, sustaining attention and monitoring, which may relate to impairments in DLPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>). These tasks also reflect deficits in keeping time and sustained performance, potentially relating to impairments in the superior medial regions of the frontal lobe, and right-sided frontal regions of Brodmann area 45 and subadjacent regions of the basal ganglia in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004867412461383">Kemp et al., 2005</xref>). Increased response time variability in patients with melancholia has been observed previously (relative to non-melancholia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0004867412461383">Winograd-Gurvich et al., 2006</xref>), and may reflect a marker of executive dysfunction, indicative of frontal or frontostriatal disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004867412461383">Pizzagalli, 2010</xref>). Melancholic participants also demonstrated impairments on the reverse digit span in comparison to controls, which in addition to poorer performance on the span of visual memory may indicate dysfunction in coding representations and monitoring as per the working memory function, also implicating DLPFC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>). These results are consistent with the proposal that melancholic patients may perform more poorly on working memory and sustained attention tasks. By contrast, patients with non-melancholia displayed poorer memory recall (immediate delay), reflecting monitoring deficits that may relate to specific impairment in the left frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>), highlighting distinctive neuropsychological impairment in subtypes of depression.</p>
<p>Contradictory findings reported in previous studies on the neuropsychological performance of depression may also be due to comorbid anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004867412461383">Basso et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004867412461383">Castaneda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004867412461383">Gualtieri and Johnson, 2008</xref>; Kaplain et al., 2006). In the current study, patients with melancholia displayed increased anxiety than those with non-melancholia (and controls). In this regard, the finding that patients with melancholia demonstrated a positive bias in time estimation may be accounted for by anxiety, with melancholic patients indicating faster average counting in comparison to controls. In addition, non-melancholic patients exhibited a negative bias in time estimation in comparison to melancholic patients, indicating slower average counting in comparison. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that immediate recall memory is more impaired in depressed patients without anxiety than those with anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004867412461383">Kizilbash et al., 2002</xref>), a finding observed in patients with non-melancholia in the current study. Here, we revealed a relationship between melancholic depression and comorbid anxiety diagnosis, with greater contributions from panic disorder to the subtype. Convergent evidence has suggested that panic disorder is associated with symptoms of hyperarousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004867412461383">Heller and Nitschke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004867412461383">Heller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004867412461383">Nitschke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0004867412461383">Watson, 2005</xref>), such as dryness of mouth, difficulty breathing, pounding heart and sweaty palms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004867412461383">Davidson, 2003</xref>). These findings are consistent with models distinguishing melancholia as a disorder of pathological hyperarousal with features of rumination, fears of the future and helplessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004867412461383">Gold and Chrousos, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Anxious arousal was a significant contributor to poor performance on reverse digit span, executive maze and memory intrusion measures. All these measures engage cognitive control monitoring strategies primarily activating the DLPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004867412461383">Stuss and Levine, 2002</xref>). Importantly, patients with melancholia only displayed poor performance on the reverse digit span task, but not on executive maze or memory intrusions measure, highlighting partial independence of subtype and symptoms. Whilst anxious arousal contributes to poorer performance on these tasks, subtypes do not differ on planning and capacity to inhibit information despite working memory being significantly impaired in melancholic patients. Psychomotor disturbance, another key feature of melancholia, predicted poorer performance on part A of the switching of attention task, a measure of information processing speed along with monitoring. While patients with melancholia and non-melancholia did not differ on the cognitive switching element of this task (part B) in the current study, possibly due to recruitment of (largely) outpatient rather than inpatient participants, prior studies have reported that melancholic patients perform poorly on these tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004867412461383">Austin et al., 1999</xref>). Anxious arousal and psychomotor disturbance were important contributors to impairment in our depressed sample, while depression symptoms and anxious apprehension contributed very little to impaired performance on these tasks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study reveals that melancholia is associated with more severe depression, anxiety and psychomotor disturbance, and that anxious arousal and psychomotor disturbance in particular contribute to poorer performance on tasks of working memory and sustained attention requiring activation of the DLPFC. Despite melancholia being more severe across symptom domains, patients with non-melancholia were characterised by poorer performance on short-delay memory recall, which relates to left frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004867412461383">Milner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004867412461383">Perret, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004867412461383">Stuss et al., 1998</xref>). Anxiety is a key characteristic of melancholia, which may be associated with greater deficits related to right-sided frontal regions. Thus, our findings support the proposal that depression is a heterogeneous disorder and depression does not simply appear to be a function of severity. Future studies should consider the extent to which these disturbances reflect state or trait deficits and whether neuropsychological markers are able to predict response (or non-response) to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004867412461383">Kemp et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings have implications for the relationships between brain function and behaviour in depression for patients with melancholia and non-melancholia.</p>

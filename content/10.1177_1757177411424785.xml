<abstract>
<p>Aretrospective audit evaluation was conducted to determine whether the introduction of two clinical skills trainers for four months in a district general hospital improved compliance with infection prevention and control practices. Saving Lives (Department of Health, 2010) peripheral venous cannula and urinary catheter high impact intervention audit data were analysed for six months before, four months during and six months after the clinical skills training was implemented for six control wards and seven intervention wards. Findings showed that although the control wards did not improve compliance significantly over the study period, the intervention wards improved compliance with the high impact intervention care bundles studied and that this practice was sustained for six months after the clinical skills training. The findings suggest that education is required to improve clinical skills surrounding cannulation and catheterisation, which can then be sustained by Saving Lives audits to reduce the risk of infection to patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Saving Lives (Department of Health (DH), 2010) was launched in 2005, revised in 2007 and 2010, and was designed to support National Health Service (NHS) organisations to reduce healthcare associated infections (HCAI). It provides evidence-based practice guidance for key clinical procedures where the risk of infection is reducible, in the form of high impact intervention (HII) care bundles (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-1757177411424785">Box 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The Department of Health provides standardised audit tools to enable NHS organisations to audit compliance to the HII care bundles, and recommends that NHS organisations in England conduct these HII audits regularly to embed good practice and continually improve compliance. Therefore if each element of the HII audits is carried out every time for every patient the risk of infection to patients will be reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411424785">DH, 2010</xref>). Most acute NHS trusts conduct these audits monthly and many use HII audit results as key performance indicators to provide assurance to the trust board and the primary care trust that the risk of infection is being addressed and reduced. However the effectiveness of conducting monthly HII audits to improve compliance with infection prevention and control practices in the clinical setting has not yet been evaluated. Saving Lives (DH, 2010) also advocates that NHS organisations should provide annual training on the prevention and control of infection in general to all staff. However previous studies have found that no research recommends the most effective way to deliver generic infection prevention and control education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177411424785">Mann and Wood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177411424785">Vaughan et al, 2006</xref>). Furthermore current training tends to be formal, short and taught didactically by content experts, for large groups of eclectic healthcare workers in the hope that enhanced knowledge will persuade staff to improve their compliance in relation to clinical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411424785">Cole, 2008</xref>). Other forms of training have therefore been developed to improve the quality and flexibility of training, for example the Skills Academy for Health launched the Core Learning Unit in 2009 which has an infection prevention and control e-learning module. This provides an assured level of quality of training and increases flexibility and access to training. However the content is generic so may not reflect local policies or practices and knowledge can be significantly lessened three months after completion of e-learning modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411424785">Fakih et al, 2006</xref>). Another alternative is teaching staff the knowledge and skills relevant to their practice in the clinical setting. Previous studies have shown that ward-based teaching sessions overcome staffing pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411424785">Richardson, 2001</xref>), that more staff are likely to attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177411424785">Scott et al, 2005</xref>) and that the training is more effective than classroom teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411424785">Gould and Chamberlain, 1997</xref>). Although ward-based teaching packages and programmes have been shown to improve compliance with infection prevention and control standard precautions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177411424785">Hung et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411424785">Kilminster et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177411424785">Uwakwe, 2000</xref>), there has been no published research into whether ward-based teaching can improve compliance with the key elements of practices recommended by the HII care bundles to reduce the risk of infections to patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective audit evaluation was used to assess whether the implementation of a programme of ward-based teaching improved infection prevention and control practice. The research tools were the national Saving Lives (DH, 2007) HII audits for peripheral intravenous cannula insertion and ongoing care and urinary catheter insertion and ongoing care, compliance with which was scored as a percentage. The sample population was a district general hospital in the United Kingdom (UK) where the HII audits were conducted monthly by ward managers; 52 wards and departments participated in this audit process every month from May 2007 and still continue to do so. In December 2007 the Infection Prevention and Control Team introduced two clinical skills trainers for four months to provide ward-based teaching surrounding the insertion and care of peripheral cannulae and urinary catheters. The clinical skills trainers had undertaken formal assessments of competence for these skills prior to commencement in post. They taught nursing staff the policies and products relevant to HII care bundles, updated their skills, and explained the rationale that underpins practice with regards to these HII invasive devices.</p>
<p>The clinical skills trainers were only employed in the medical directorate and therefore the sample size comprised the 13 wards in that directorate. Seven wards were randomly selected as the intervention group and the clinical skills trainers taught on these wards. Six wards comprised the control group as nursing staff on these wards had no access to the clinical skills training. Both the control and the intervention groups were of a similar case mix as each group included emergency, acute and elderly medical wards. Monthly HII audit results for peripheral cannula insertion and care and urinary catheter insertion and care were analysed retrospectively for the six months before, the four months during and the six months following the training to ascertain whether the clinical skills training improved compliance with these HII care bundles and therefore improved monthly audit results for the intervention group. Consent to access and use of this data was gained from the National Research Ethics Service, the Research and Development Committee at the hospital and from the Lead Infection Prevention and Control Nurse. Data were analysed using SPSS (version 14.0) and significance set at 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The HII audit results for peripheral cannula insertion and ongoing care and urinary catheter insertion and ongoing care were analysed for the six months before, the four months during and the six months after the clinical skills trainers were in post. The data were normally distributed except for urinary catheter insertion data; therefore this data was analysed separately using non-parametric tests. There were no significant differences in the data between the control and intervention groups before the clinical skills training started for peripheral cannula insertion, peripheral cannula ongoing care, urinary catheter insertion and urinary catheter ongoing care (<italic>p</italic>=0.228, 0.614, 0.073 and 0.184, respectively). Mean audit scores for each HII care bundle before, during and after the intervention for both groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411424785">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>For peripheral cannula insertion, without the clinical skills trainers the control group made no significant improvements in audit results (<italic>p</italic>=0.153) but did improve in the last six months of the study, from 64.57% to 82.13%, perhaps as this care bundle became gradually embedded. The intervention group improved consistently over the study period, in particular the scores for peripheral cannula insertion were significantly better, while the clinical skills training was available compared with before the training (<italic>p</italic>=0.009) and increased to 84.57% in the six months after the training. Similarly for peripheral cannula ongoing care, the intervention group made small and consistent improvements to compliance throughout the study period, while the control group did not improve until the last six months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411424785">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>With regards to urinary catheter insertion compliance, the findings showed that compliance with this care bundle was good for the intervention group before any intervention (98.82%), which increased to 100% during and 100% after the clinical skills training. For the control group, compliance was 65.42% before, 100% during and 98.67% after the study period, though this improvement was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.135).</p>
<p>For urinary catheter ongoing care results, the intervention group scores for catheter ongoing care increased throughout the study and were significantly better after the skills training compared with during the training (<italic>p</italic>=0.042). The control group results yielded no significant improvements (<italic>p</italic>=0.168) and decreased after the study period from 94.06% to 80.60% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411424785">Table 1</xref>). However, for both groups the overall compliance throughout the study period was much higher for urinary catheterisation and catheter ongoing care than for peripheral cannulation and peripheral cannula ongoing care.</p>

<sec id="section4-1757177411424785" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this retrospective audit evaluation offer some useful insight for practice relating to the effectiveness of both audit and ward-based clinical skills training to improve practice.</p>
<p>With regards to peripheral intravenous cannulation and ongoing care, results suggest that Saving Lives audits alone had little effect on improving the skills of cannulation and ongoing care during the first part of the study, and the implementation of clinical skills training increased scores for both these skills, significantly for cannulation, and these were sustained over the six months after the skills training was completed. Cannulation and ongoing care scores for the control group did increase in the last six months of the study period, perhaps because the care bundle was gradually becoming embedded, or other contributory factors that were not studied or because of the Hawthorne effect. Although direct observation has historically been perceived to be the best method of audit and is the most commonly used approach it can be subject to both bias and the Hawthorne effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177411424785">Stein et al, 2003</xref>). This could therefore affect the result of the Saving Lives audits as they were completed under direct observation of practice by the ward managers. Therefore the concept of self-audit must be considered as a factor that may have affected the audit results. Yet it could be suggested that if either group were affected by either the Hawthorne effect or any self-audit bias, then the compliance scores to the care bundles would have been significantly higher than they actually were.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177411424785">Department of Health (2007)</xref> intended Saving Lives audits to be used to identify small changes or improvements to practice to be implemented each month, so that when re-audited the following month, compliance improves until 100% is achieved and sustained. Therefore, regardless of access to ward-based training, by the design of the Saving Lives programme, it could be suggested that 100% compliance should have been achieved by all wards in the study after 16 months of implementation. However, a recent study that completed Infection Control Nurses Association audits over a four year period resulted in the facilitation of improvement of compliance from 88% to 93% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177411424785">Millward et al, 2010</xref>), suggesting that 100% compliance may not be achievable in a 16 month timeframe. Therefore, for this study it could be suggested that either the Saving Lives audits were not effective at eliminating poor practice or that monthly audit results were not interpreted and acted upon in a timely manner. Although the Saving Lives audits provided useful data for the ward mangers regarding compliance with the care bundles on their wards, this information is only worthwhile if they can then translate it into actions required for their ward and then implement relevant interventions in a relatively short period of time. There is also a cost implication to the use of the audit tools. For example, assuming three hours per month of a ward manager for the 52 departments for the hospital in this study equals approximately £2.4k per month or £28.7k per annum, which could perhaps have been better utilised, for example to provide further clinical skills training.</p>
<p>With regards to urinary catheterisation scores, findings suggest that although the intervention group had high scores before the clinical skills training, they achieved 100% with further training and this was sustained after the training ceased. The control group also maintained good scores, suggesting that nurses’ urinary catheterisation skills were consistently compliant for both groups. Similarly, scores for urinary catheter ongoing care remained high for both groups throughout the study period, particularly when compared with the cannula insertion and ongoing care scores. This could be because initial peripheral intravenous cannulation training is not sufficient, while initial urinary catheterisation training is adequate. For example, locally catheterisation is taught as a pre-registration skill by clinical skill educators, while cannulation is taught post-registration by representatives from private companies. Such training provided for cannulation may not include local policies, products and care plans, while the training for catheterisation does, suggesting a need to improve training surrounding cannulation. This finding is echoed in the literature surrounding infection prevention knowledge, application and compliance, which has identified a need for increased infection prevention education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177411424785">Stein et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177411424785">Trigg et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177411424785">Wu et al, 2006</xref>), improvements to current infection prevention education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177411424785">Mann and Wood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177411424785">Vaughan et al, 2006</xref>) and the causes for current limited knowledge to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177411424785">Trim et al, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, the reduced compliance with cannulation and care of cannulae could also be attributed to the concept that over time staff forget or fail to apply the correct techniques to practice. Some research into poor compliance to practice suggest that this may be because ritualistic practices can prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177411424785">Haas and Larson, 2007</xref>) and that nurses may believe their compliance is better than it actually is when observed, audited and quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411424785">Cole, 2008</xref>). Although lack of sufficient education could therefore provide a simple rationale for poor compliance with cannulation and cannula care, it may also be suggested that infection prevention and control compliance is far more complex, with determinants such as attitudes, beliefs, habits and organisational culture affecting behaviour and therefore practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411424785">Cole, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177411424785">Hanna et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177411424785">Whitby et al, 2006</xref>). It could therefore be inferred that a change in attitude and behaviour is required if compliance with infection prevention and control practice is to be sustained without input from such staff as clinical skills trainers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177411424785">Parker, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To conclude, the findings of this study suggest that, given the high emphasis currently placed on infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, key skills such as peripheral intravenous cannula insertion and care of cannulae should be an inherent part of practice but seem not to be unless reinforced by further training and audit. Therefore either attitude towards infection prevention and control must be changed or else there is a necessity for such educational roles as clinical skills trainers to regularly update nurses’ clinical skills in order to improve compliance with key infection prevention and control procedures. Furthermore, for this sample population, with the exception of catheterisation, Saving Lives audits did not achieve 100% compliance consistently for either group and therefore did not successfully eliminate poor practice or significantly minimise the risk of infection to patients, which is what the tools are designed to do. Therefore training for ward managers surrounding audit results interpretation action planning may also be beneficial in order to develop the usefulness of the Saving Lives audits. Although practice is increasingly becoming more audit led and governance focused in order to drive improvements in practice, measures such as supporting nurses in the clinical environment through clinical skills education and effective audit action planning may successfully contribute to improvements in audit results, with the overall outcome of reducing infection rates, increasing the quality of patient care and meeting the Saving Lives objectives.</p>

<title>About the Infection Prevention Society</title>
<p>The Infection Prevention society works together with healthcare colleagues, professional bodies, industry, government agencies and voluntary organisations in the prevention and control of infection. Our main aim is to advance the specialty of infection prevention and control through education, professional development of our members and research. With the continued need to prevent and control existing, re-emerging and new infections the Society is at the forefront of initiatives across the United Kingdom and Eire in both hospital and community settings. Members of the Society are active locally, regionally, nationally and internationally in cross boundary activities that support the quality and clinical governance agenda in providing safe and effective patient care. The <italic>Journal of Infection Prevention</italic> is provided as a benefit to members of the Infection Prevention Society.</p>

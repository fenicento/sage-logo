<p>The concept of avascular necrosis (AVN) in the foot and ankle has been a source of controversy in recent years primarily because of a more heightened awareness and the evolution of newer techniques to address this condition. The widespread availability of MRI technology has provided a better understanding but has also fueled some controversial debate. In this symposium, the issue of AVN in the context of specific pathologies will be discussed.</p>

<title>Talar Neck Fracture</title>
<sec id="section2-1938640012441335">
<title>How can one explain the inconsistent rate of avascular necrosis of the talus after a fracture dislocation of the talar neck?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>I believe the mechanism for AVN is probably multifactorial and includes level of dislocation, time to fracture reduction, variation in blood supply disruption, and operative approach/extent of surgical dissection. The multitude of etiological factors fuels the speculation and the controversy with this topic.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>One would assume that this is related to the extent of inconsistent damage to the blood supply to the body of the talus during injury. Indeed, there is no particular way to predict the development of AVN other than a vague statistic for each type of talar neck fracture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Although I think that the predictive capacity of the actual Hawkins level of injury is still somewhat accurate, the discovery of partial AVN due to better imaging modalities has added to the confusion. However, I am not convinced that we truly understand the true distribution of the blood supply of the talus or, for that matter, the amount of variability of that supply from patient to patient. Lastly, perhaps since most of these fractures are treated with operative reduction, there may be some iatrogenic factors that have yet to be identified.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>The inconsistency may be due to an expected and notorious historic rate of AVN compared to actual AVN rates in practice today. From the time of the classic article written by Hawkins in 1970, I think it is clear that the deleterious effects of AVN are lower today. This is likely due to the recognition of the urgency of the fracture, the increased awareness of the subtleties of technique, as well as improvements in fracture fixation. These improvements do not decrease AVN at the time of fracture but rather allow proper fracture healing and eventual resolution of the AVN.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1938640012441335">
<title>What is the best method of identifying AVN both early and late in course of injury to the talus? How reliable are these modalities?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>Early after the injury, I prefer to use gadolinium-enhanced MRI to get a sense on the vascularity of the talus to help the patient better understand risk for collapse. I find this much more reliable than plain MRI since bone edema fat-suppressed images can itself create a confusing picture and may not reflect accurate perfusion patterns. In later timelines, I am looking for the volume and location of remaining dead bone and associated cartilage damage and tend to gravitate to using CT arthrogram for this purpose.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>MRI is certainly the most reliable method to diagnose AVN; however, for practical purposes, I use MRI combined with CT scan when planning reconstruction. The MRI often presents a picture that demonstrates more severe disease than is actually present due to edema, making the CT helpful in determining segmental AVN patterns.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>MRI. It is helpful to use titanium fixation to increase the reliability in postoperative MRI evaluation.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1938640012441335">
<title>If avascular necrosis has been identified, what factors are important in predicting collapse and ultimately prognosis?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>One factor is the extent of Hawkins sign and ultimately the percentage of volume of the AVN. No one knows for sure, but it seems that larger volumes of involvement are at a higher risk and carry a poorer prognosis. An incomplete Hawkins sign shows that there is an incomplete AVN, and this has a better prognosis.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>There are none. We have not found that the extent of AVN nor the timing of weight bearing following injury and fracture healing to be of any value in predicting the development of collapse. Indeed, the AVN may be total as, for example, following reimplantation of an extruded talus, and while AVN is of course present and total, collapse may not occur.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>This is probably the most vexing problem in the management of these patients. Although it is intuitive that one would want revascularization, many patients have areas of AVN that never revascularize. Interestingly, it is these patients that do not seem to collapse, regardless of the size of the zone of AVN. As such, the predictability of collapse may be more related to revascularization, regardless of the location and size of the avascular zone.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>I believe the most important factor for prognosis is that the fracture heals. As long as the fracture does heal, the outcome seems to be favorable for the most part, even in the face of AVN. Additionally, care must be taken to avoid varus malrotation when open reduction, internal fixation (ORIF) is performed, particularly with comminuted fractures. The shortened medial neck results in a varus posture that compromises subtalar function and results in a poorer prognosis; in fact, I believe that varus malrotation of the talar neck has more morbid consequences than AVN itself.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1938640012441335">
<title>What measures do you take when total avascular necrosis of the talus has been identified after injury? Does this protocol change if there is only partial AVN?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>Off-loading the talus, especially during revascularization, is standard, but most patients find it undesirable to do this for more than a couple of months. I have tried performing core decompression with bone grafting via several core tracts in an attempt to bring more vasculature and live cells into the AVN zone.</p>
<p>Partial AVN seems to be more stable. So I tend to monitor closely and see how they progress over time with protected weight bearing after the fracture is healed. If they remain symptomatic, then similar protocol of core decompression/drilling is considered.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>There are 2 issues here. The first is whether AVN can be prevented in any way, and the second is the management once AVN has been diagnosed. First, hyperbaric oxygen may be of some benefit in the early fracture management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012441335">1</xref></sup> There have also been studies demonstrating a lower incidence of AVN after fracture of the talar neck when ORIF is combined with a vascularized bone graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012441335">2</xref></sup> Once healing of the fracture has occurred, however, I do not take any measures to protect the talus following the diagnosis of AVN. Off-loading the limb with custom bracing, non–weight bearing, and immobilization do not seem to have any effect on the development of collapse of the talus. Once the talar neck fracture has healed, rehabilitation may commence per protocol. Partial AVN of the talus generally occurs in the anterior superior and lateral portion of the talar body, and I do not manage the rehabilitation and recovery any differently.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I used to believe that it was prudent to do decompressions of the larger areas of AVN, paralleling the logic of AVN in the femoral head. Empirically, the radiographic appearances were improved, and none of the patients ever collapsed. This suggests that it doesn’t really lead to revascularization and that it might be better to leave these patients alone. It is impractical to keep patients non–weight bearing for protracted periods of time waiting for the talus to revascularize. As such, I will usually get at least 1 contrast-enhanced MRI at various intervals to try and chronicle the change in vascularity of the talus. If it seems to be improving, patients are more accepting of prolonged non–weight bearing, but if there is no evidence of improvement in the vascularity, the patients are allowed to bear weight after a full disclosure of the known and unknown risks.</p>
<p>If the focal areas of AVN are peripheral close to an articular and weight-bearing surface, I am actually more cautious. In particular, those patients with focal areas of AVN that are close to the talar dome are protected from axial load longer as the likelihood of revascularization seems much higher. I try to preserve the contour of the talar dome at all costs, whereas it is less important if the area of impending or potential collapse is closer to the subtalar joint.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>I am more cautious with total talar AVN than with partial AVN. I monitor for collapse more frequently and delay weight bearing. I prescribe a patella tendon bearing an off-loading brace for total talar AVN. I am more likely to perform an adjunct procedure such as subtalar fusion or core decompression in the hopes of preventing collapse.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938640012441335">
<title>How does one explain the relatively high union rate of the talar neck fracture, even if AVN of the body is identified?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>I think this is associated with disruption of the vasculature at the dorsal neck as well as the tarsal canal from both the injury and the surgical approach taken.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>Blood supply and arterial anatomy.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I don’t know, but I believe that most surgeons that treat these injuries have an inherent respect for the precarious blood supply and do less stripping of the soft tissue. If the body is completely avascular, it is analogous to revascularization of large structural allografts, where the new blood supply crosses the interface, but fails to revascularize the entire allograft, or in the talar fracture model, the body of the talus.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>I believe this is due to anatomical reduction with internal fixation allowing creeping substitution to remodel the AVN.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1938640012441335">
<title>Does early subtalar fusion help prevent the possibility of collapse?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>It probably helps with revascularization; however, I am not convinced that it helps prevent collapse since collapse is a revascularization phenomenon and involves loss of the structural integrity of the subchondral bone. Fusion, however, may be justified when considering ankle fusion or total ankle replacement to help preserve or enhance the remaining blood supply.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>No. Two decades ago, we used to believe that subtalar arthrodesis would help revascularize the talus, but this has not proven to be correct. It is curious, however, that a successful arthrodesis of the subtalar joint may occur in the presence of AVN of the talus. We have noted however in a large series of subtalar arthrodesis that the presence of AVN increases the rate of nonunion of the arthrodesis. The latter may, however, apply as much to the presence of sclerosis and AVN of both the talus and the calcaneus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012441335">3</xref></sup></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I do not believe that it helps. I would rather wait until the clinical picture is clarified as much as possible before doing preemptive surgery of this nature.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>I do not typically do an early subtalar fusion for AVN of the talus as I believe a large number of cases will resolve without this operation. Many patients will take 2 to 3 years to completely revascularize. If I am concerned about impending collapse, then a subtalar fusion is a reasonable option, although the precise amount of increased blood supply to the talus after subtalar fusion has not been determined.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1938640012441335">
<title>Is there any preemptive treatment that can diminish the incidence or extent of involvement of AVN after talar neck fracture?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>One consideration is performing minimal incision ORIF of the fracture and limiting surgical dissection.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>No. There is no correlation between the timing of surgery and the development of AVN of the talus following talar neck fractures.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Although somewhat contrary to prevailing wisdom, I believe that the lateral surgical exposure may have some detriment, particularly with dissection of the area near or in the sinus tarsi. I strive to get an anatomical reduction strictly from the medial surgical exposure. Even the debris in the lateral aspect of the subtalar joint can be excavated through the primary fracture plane from the medial incision.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>Prompt ORIF, anatomical reduction, and delayed weight bearing until fracture union.</p>

<title>AVN of the Talar Dome</title>
<sec id="section10-1938640012441335">
<title>Often times after an MRI, the radiologist will report areas of avascular necrosis. How reliable are the MRI findings identifying areas of true avascular bone? Can this be differentiated from “bone edema”?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>I think standard MRI is a problem due to the confusing picture of bone edema and AVN having a similar appearance. The use of MRI with gadolinium enhancement will tend to show a perfusion void and help better define an area of AVN.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>This is difficult, and the MRI diagnosis should be combined with the clinical findings. I would not base the diagnosis of AVN on an early MRI image since edema is difficult to distinguish from AVN at this stage. True AVN with patchy necrosis associated with bone sclerosis and edema is easier to diagnose on MRI, but generally, this is a later finding.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Clearly, non-contrast-enhanced MRIs overstate the volume of AVN. The radiology reports typically describe the distribution of signal changes but really do not tell us the genesis of these signal changes. We routinely use contrast as part of our imaging protocols unless contrast is contraindicated.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>Bone edema and AVN have similar characteristics and thus findings on MRI. Bone edema can be part of the AVN process. In the face of trauma, MRI can be reliable in diagnosing AVN. However, one of the most troubling conditions is a patient with chronic pain in the talar region without history of trauma. These patients may or may not have other risk factors for nontraumatic AVN. An MRI is performed, and there is so-called bone edema in the talus that is read as AVN. In my experience, this can be painful for 24 to 36 months and eventually resolves on MRI over about the same amount of time. Core decompression has not been very successful in my hands. I think it probably is AVN, and monitoring with subsequent MRI exams is needed to evaluate for progression and collapse.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1938640012441335">
<title>How is the integrity of the cartilage on the talar dome best evaluated? If the cartilage is intact, how successful is retrograde drilling of the talus?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>CT arthrogram is most helpful in defining the articular layer since it has better detail definition and generally thinner cuts, so the entire surface can be evaluated. Additionally, there are newer MRI techniques (color-encoded T1 mapping) that are being used to analyze water content in the cartilage that can help define areas of cartilage damage. This requires larger 3T magnets that have improved resolution. As they become more available, we will expand the use of this technique. Retrograde drilling is a useful technique in improving symptoms associated with AVN. However, it has limited ability to drastically change the appearance of subsequent diagnostic imaging. It is unclear actually how much of the AVN volume becomes revascularized with this technique.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>While imaging studies may be useful, the only reliable method of evaluating the cartilage is made arthroscopically. There is considerable overlap between an osteochondral lesion of the talus and focal AVN. Nonetheless, if the cartilage is intact with a focal process of AVN, a procedure that attempts revascularization is appropriate. There are numerous alternatives, including retrograde drilling (which I do not favor), core decompression, and a vascularized pedicle graft.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>Regardless of the integrity of the cartilage, retrograde drilling of the talus has not been very successful for me. I usually save this treatment if continued pain and nonresolution occurs. It could be more successful if used earlier in the AVN process, but I do not routinely employ this operation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>Since this area of involvement is so small, it would be very difficult to successfully perform any retrograde drilling. I would initially evaluate this area arthroscopically and consider local debridement. If that was unsuccessful, I would be inclined to perform cartilage resurfacing with a refrigerated allograft talus and actually remove the dead bone and overlying cartilage with a refrigerated block allograft.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>In the absence of a history here, I cannot determine if this is an acute process following injury associated with bone edema (in which case I would treat the patient symptomatically with activity modification and rest) or a chronic process. If the latter, I would initiate the treatment arthroscopically to determine more accurately the status of the articular surface that appears to be significantly irregular posteromedially.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>In smaller lesions such as this, I usually perform arthroscopic microfracture as a first line of treatment. I think that the success rate, even for medial lesions, is much higher than we have been taught. If it fails to alleviate the symptoms, I favor fresh block talar allograft replacement.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>Assuming this patient has a chronically painful ankle, I would first consider curettage with microfracture. It appears that a large portion of the joint is viable and healthy. If this failed to provide pain relief, I would then consider an en bloc resection with fresh talar allograft of the entire medial shoulder. OATS (osteochondral autograft transfer system)-type procedures on the shoulder have been far less successful for me than on the dome itself.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>This is a lesion I would strongly consider performing a retrograde drilling through the sinus tarsi area (several tracts fanning off a main conduit) to perforate the walled-off area between live and dead bone.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>If asymptomatic, I would not treat this at all. There is complete AVN of the talar body without any evidence of collapse, and the articular surface appears to be intact. As noted above, it is difficult to predict the clinical course of this pathology, and one has to decide if in the asymptomatic patient, some prophylactic surgical treatment would be of benefit. If symptomatic, then core decompression in isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012441335">4</xref></sup> or combined with a vascularized bone graft would be my treatment of choice (M. S. Myerson and S. Neufeld, “The use of a vascularized pedicle bone graft from the anterior process of the calcaneus in the treatment of avascular necrosis of the talus,” 2002).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I too would perform retrograde drilling with autogenous bone grafting through a sinus tarsi approach. Again, I would make every effort to avoid the local vascular arcade in that area.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>For this patient, I would give time and limited weight-bearing activities. I like PTB braces in this circumstance. No obvious collapse has taken place but certainly is concerning for impending collapse. For this patient, I would consider core decompression and even STJ fusion, although neither of these is reliable in talar revascularization. If collapse ensued, my preferred treatment is a total ankle with a stem talar component.</p>

<title>AVN of the Talus With Total Ankle Replacement</title>
<sec id="section13-1938640012441335">
<title>Aside from complete AVN of the talar body, what is the maximal involvement of AVN that would preclude a total ankle replacement? Please elaborate.</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>If the area of AVN is confined to the superior quadrants of the talus, successful total ankle replacement can be performed. The extent of the AVN in these upper quadrants may require designs that naturally resect more bone to effectively remove the dead bone.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>We do not know what is the exact percentage of vascularized and viable talar body that must be present for bone ingrowth to occur. This is obviously relevant to most surgeons; however, I do not believe that there is any contraindication to performing ankle replacement in the setting of AVN. Presumably, the likelihood of subsidence of the talar component has been the major concern for the presence of AVN, and indeed, I and other authors have stated that AVN, particularly if complete is a contraindication to performing ankle replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012441335">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012441335">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012441335">9</xref></sup> One has to put this in historic perspective and consider the shape of the talar component and the need for osseous integration. Historically (in the United States anyway), the Agility prosthesis (DePuy, Warsaw, IN) was associated with a high rate of talar component subsidence, and the presence of AVN clearly added to this potential complication, leading surgeons to conclude that this was a contraindication to this procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012441335">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012441335">6</xref></sup> With the development of newer generations of prostheses that have improved surface coverage of the talus, I believe that this is less of a concern, particularly if the AVN is partial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012441335">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012441335">4</xref>).

<p>This patient has profound avascular necrosis of the talus associated with talar body collapse and hindfoot cavovarus deformity (A, B). This was treated with a long-stem patient customized Agility LP prosthesis, combined with a calcaneus osteotomy to improve the hindfoot deformity (C, D). The calcaneus osteotomy was first performed and secured with a temporary guide pin, followed by insertion of the long-stem talar component and an additional screw to hold the osteotomy.</p>

<p>I like to wait a sufficient period of time from the injury, such that it would be highly unlikely for focal revascularization of the zone of AVN. I do not worry so much if over 50% of the talar component porous-coated surface will be in contact with viable bone.</p>

<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>I will do a total ankle even with complete talar body AVN. One must use caution, however, because these are custom implants and can be very difficult to perform. Depending on how much bone is left of the talus, a stemmed talar component can be used to bypass weaker bone or even sit on the cortical bone of the calcaneus. If the majority of the talus is nonviable, then I have done total talar implants with a talar component that has a stem into the calcaneus, an articular surface for the navicular, and an articular surface for the total ankle at the tibia. Although I have not done many of these, they have worked quite well. I really dislike doing pantalar fusions or tibiocalcaneal fusions as they are not very functional.</p>

<title>Would the presence of a varus deformity that would require a deltoid ligament release to correct the talus alter your decision to do a total ankle replacement in a patient with AVN of the talus? What about if a subtalar fusion was also required in addition to the medial ligament release?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>The deltoid is the most stable ligament and blood supply to the talus. Doing a deltoid sleeve release in the setting of partial AVN needs to be carefully weighed. One can consider a vertical osteotomy of the medial malleolus popularized by Cornelius Doets, MD, from the Netherlands. This avoids deltoid sectioning and allows full reduction of the varus deformity. The net result is distal translation of the medial malleolus after fixation.</p>
<p>A deltoid sleeve release with a subtalar fusion could potentially perpetuate additional AVN of the talus and lead to subsidence of the talar component. It relates back to the anatomy of the talar vasculature. A limited exposure of the posterior facet for arthrodesis avoiding dissection of the sinus tarsi and canal may obviate this risk.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>I do not believe that a fixed varus deformity associated with AVN changes my decision to perform an ankle replacement. There are 2 basic alternatives to correcting the fixed varus deformity of the talus: the first is to release the deltoid by stripping it off either the talus or the medial malleolus, and the alternative is to “release” it by performing a vertical lengthening osteotomy of the medial malleolus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012441335">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1938640012441335">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1938640012441335">7</xref>). The sectioning of the deltoid ligament theoretically disrupts the remaining blood supply to the talus and could lead to further devascularization. However, there have been no reports of AVN occurring postoperatively following release of the deltoid associated with ankle replacement. Of course, in the general setting of varus deformity, the talus is normally vascularized, and the release of the deltoid only disrupts a small area of the talar body, and it is not likely that AVN would ensue anyway. It should be noted that a fixed varus deformity associated with AVN is often caused by a malunion of a talar neck fracture. In this setting, the apex of the varus deformity is in the neck of the talus and across the transverse tarsal joint, and regardless of the method used to attain a neutral talus, the hindfoot deformity must also be corrected with a triple arthrodesis. The planning of the hindfoot correction is imperative, and the surgeon must decide whether the procedure should be performed as a single or staged procedure (the latter being my preference).</p>

<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I really try to avoid doing a STJ fusion in the varus ankle when I know that a deltoid peel will be required. If I need to correct overall varus posture of the heel, I will do a lateral closing wedge osteotomy of the calcaneus with a very large wedge resection.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>Well, I am very hesitant to do a medial malleolar osteotomy or a deltoid ligament release in a patient with talar AVN. The deltoid vasculature to the talus is often times the only blood supply (it is at least the most predictable) that is preserved after talar neck fractures. I do not think that the potential blood supply gained by a subtalar fusion would offset the blood supply lost by a deltoid release. Most likely, I will be relying on the talar bone supplied by the deltoid vasculature to support the talar component. It could be catastrophic if a large portion of the talus dies after the total ankle and deltoid release.</p>

<title>How likely is the presence of partial AVN of the talus to alter the incidence of bony ingrowth to the talar component?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Christensen:</speaker>
<p>I am not sure how much bony ingrowth really occurs in any ankle replacement and is probably a fraction of the surface area. Therefore, I would not have too much concern with a partial AVN with a prosthesis that has a resurfacing design as long as the majority of the surface has exposure to live bone. I would be more concerned with designs that require a flat cut of the talus and do not excise all of the diseased bone.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Myerson:</speaker>
<p>I do not know the answer to this question; however, I have been surprised at the vascularity of the talar body when AVN has been diagnosed preoperatively. It is impossible to know whether ingrowth occurs and how much ingrowth is present (unless there is loosening and/or collapse of the talar component). To make this more complicated, it is even more difficult to diagnose AVN postoperatively on plain radiographs since some talar components cover both the medial and lateral talus.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I am also somewhat skeptical regarding the incidence and extent of true bony ingrowth to the components, but again, approximately 50% of the porous surface should be in contact with a viable bony substrate.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Steck:</speaker>
<p>Preoperative MRIs are valuable to help determine how much bone is avascular; often times, the avascular bone will be removed in the process of instrumentation of the talus. With the new virtual resurfacing talar components that are available, I will still accept up to 15% to 20% of bone loss underneath these components. Even with this bone loss, the chance of talar subsidence is very low; in addition, the avascular bone can be removed and grafted with the copious amount of cancellous bone available after resection of the distal tibia.</p>

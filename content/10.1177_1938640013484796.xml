<p><italic>Purpose</italic>. The purpose of this study was to systematically review studies on autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) for osteochondral lesions (OCLs) of the talus and descriptively analyze the outcome data reported to determine whether it is consistent from one study to another and able to be pooled for systematic review. <italic>Methods</italic>. A systematic electronic search was performed using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Studies that were published between January 1966 and June 2011 were included in the review. Only studies that reported data specifically on AOT for treatment of OCLs of the talus and written in English were included in this review. A predefined data sheet with 36 variables was created, and it was determined whether or not each of those variables were reported or not reported. The 36 variables were then grouped into 6 categories, and the categorical means were reported. <italic>Results</italic>. A total of 20 studies were included in this systematic review. The categories of general demographics and study design were generally well reported (each more than 80% of studies). Patient-reported outcomes and clinical variables were reported less in 73% and 67% of studies, respectively. The least-reported categories were patient history (45%) and imaging data (49%). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Inconsistencies and an underreporting of data were apparent between studies, such that pooling was deemed not possible. An effort must be made by investigators to ensure that there is adequate reporting of data in studies of AOT treatment for OCLs of the talus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteochondral lesions (OCLs) of the talus are a common pathology found in both recreational and professional athletes. There are more than 27 000 ankle sprains in the United States per day, and of those, up to 50% may eventually develop into an OCL of the talus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484796">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013484796"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484796">3</xref></sup> These debilitating injuries are often associated with chronic ankle pain and may lead to functional impairment and end-stage osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640013484796">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013484796"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013484796">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although conservative treatment is a potential option for managing smaller lesions and lesions in the pediatric population, many patients require some form of surgical intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013484796">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640013484796">7</xref></sup> The primary treatment strategy for lesions less than 15 mm in diameter is reparative bone marrow stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013484796">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484796">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013484796">9</xref></sup> However, concerns regarding the longevity of fibrocartilage formed by reparative techniques have prompted the investigation of replacement strategies that use viable hyaline cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013484796">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640013484796"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013484796">12</xref></sup> As a result, more advanced replacement strategies, including autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT), have been developed for lesions larger than 15 mm, cystic lesions, or following failed reparative procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013484796">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013484796">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640013484796">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013484796"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640013484796"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640013484796"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640013484796"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640013484796"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640013484796"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640013484796">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In AOT one or more cylindrical cartilage-bone grafts are harvested, most commonly from a non-weigh-bearing portion of the ipsilateral knee, and transplanted into a prepared defect site on the talus. The theoretical advantage of replacement strategies over reparative techniques is that the damaged cartilage is replaced with hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage as opposed to the mechanically inferior fibrocartilage associated with bone marrow stimulation techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640013484796">21</xref></sup> Currently, however, there is no consensus as to which treatment strategies are most appropriate for the treatment of OCLs of the talus.</p>
<p>The literature on the use of AOT for treatment of OCLs of the talus appears inconsistent. Short-term studies have reported successful radiological and functional outcomes overall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640013484796">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938640013484796">23</xref></sup> However, there are few long-term studies on the procedure, and concerns regarding knee morbidity and return to activity have been raised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938640013484796">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938640013484796"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938640013484796">26</xref></sup> Systematic reviews are essential to evidence-based medicine, in that they allow researchers to critically evaluate all available data on a focused topic. The aim of this systematic review on AOT for treatment of OCLs of the talus was 2-fold: to assess how well data are reported and determine whether conclusions can be drawn based on the available evidence.</p>

<title>Search Strategy</title>
<p>This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the <italic>Cochrane Handbook</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938640013484796">27</xref></sup> The electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 1966-June 2011) were systematically screened independently and selected by 2 of the authors. The search was performed in June 2011. The search parameters used were as follows: (OATS OR osteochondral autologous transplantation OR autologous transplantation OR osteochondral autografting OR mosaicplasty OR osteochondral autograft OR osteoarticular transplant system) AND (ankle OR talus OR talar). The reference lists of all publications, including systematic reviews, included in the search results were screened for additional articles not found through electronic search.</p>
<p>The following set of exclusion criteria, alone or in combination, were used for this study: The study was not in English, not published in a peer-reviewed journal, was not a clinical study, and was a case report or other form of level V evidence; a combination of diagnoses was evaluated and results were not separately described for the AOT group (ie, confounding variables); follow-up was less than 6 months; AOT was not performed on lesions of the talus; and/or the surgical treatment was inadequately described to ascertain whether AOT was used.</p>

<sec id="section4-1938640013484796">
<title>Outcome Measures, Data Extraction, and Management</title>
<p>A standardized data collection sheet was developed. In all, 36 variables were recorded as either “reported” or “not reported” for each included study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938640013484796">Table 1</xref>). These variables were grouped into 6 categories: (1) general demographic information, (2) patient history, (3) study design, (4) clinical variables, (5) imaging data, and (6) patient-reported outcomes. The lead author validated the extracted data by processing the included studies again after data extraction.</p>

<p>Almost all studies (97.5%) reported gender and mean age of patients constituting the general demographics category. The variables under study design were also well reported, with a mean of 87%. The number of patients and mean duration of follow-up were reported in 100% of studies, and study type was reported in 95%. The percentage of patients available for follow-up and surgical approach used to access the lesion were reported 85% of the time. However, the technique used to measure lesion size was reported in only 50% of cases. The classification system used was reported in 90% of studies, but 9 different classification systems were used in the 20 studies included in the review.</p>
<p>The category of patient-reported outcomes was reported at a mean of 73%. The preoperative pain, function, and activity scale was reported at 70%. Additionally, pain, function, and activity scales at follow-up were reported in all studies. In all, 13 different pain, function, and activity scales were used in the 20 studies included in our review. Patient satisfaction was reported in 50% of articles.</p>
<p>The categories under clinical variables were reported at a mean of 67%. Lesion size and lesion location were well reported, at 95% and 90%, respectively. Harvest site morbidity and rehabilitation protocol were also well reported, at 85% and 80%. The least-reported variables were associated pathology (50%), diagnostic arthroscopy (55%), second-look arthroscopy (50%), and tissue infill of the donor site (15%). With regard to the osteochondral graft, the harvest site was reported in 95% of cases, whereas the size of the graft and number of grafts used were reported in 55% and 70% of studies, respectively.</p>
<p>The 2 least-reported categories were patient history (45%) and imaging data (49%). In the patient history category, BMI was the least reported in the patient history category (20%), whereas previous traumatic event was the most well reported variable of the category, at 65%. Mean duration of symptoms was reported at 50% and activity level at 45%. The most well-reported variable in the imaging category was follow-up MRI, which was reported in 80%, followed by diagnostic MRI (70%) and follow-up radiograph (65%). Of those studies that used preoperative or postoperative MRI, only 20% of studies indicated the strength of the MRI magnet. The diagnostic radiograph, diagnostic CT scan, and follow-up CT scan were reported at 50%, 45%, and 20%, respectively. Follow-up imaging was taken of the harvest site in 10% of studies.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether or not the available data reported on AOT for treatment of OCLs of the talus was consistent across studies and whether conclusions could be drawn based on the available evidence. As expected, general demographics and study design were well reported with all studies reporting mean age and range, follow-up time and range, and number of patients. The reporting of pain, function, and activity scale at follow-up was impressive at 100%. However, it should be noted that not all studies reported a pain, function, and activity scale preoperatively (70%), making it impossible for some studies to compare preoperative and postoperative scores. In addition, 13 different scales were used to assess pain, function, and activity levels, making homogeneous evaluation across studies difficult or impossible. Ideally, all studies would use the same functional outcome scoring assessment, but to our knowledge, there is no validated scoring system available for AOT in the treatment of talar OCLs.</p>
<p>AOT is indicated for failed primary procedures, cystic lesions, and large OCLs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640013484796">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1938640013484796">43</xref></sup> The current literature on AOT reports lesion size very well at 95%, but how lesion size is measured is not well reported (50%). It is important that studies report how the lesion size was measured, whether intraoperatively or by imaging. Some authors believe that because of the large degree of signal change that can arise secondarily to edema after ankle injuries, MRI may overestimate the extent of OCLs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1938640013484796">45</xref></sup> Mintz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1938640013484796">46</xref></sup> established a correlation between MRI and arthroscopic findings for grading the integrity cartilage, but to our knowledge, no study has correlated MRI and arthroscopic findings for the size of the lesion.</p>
<p>Several variables that have been shown to influence outcomes of treatments of OCLs were not well reported. Notably, BMI and previous traumatic experience were both poorly reported, at 20% and 65%, respectively, and both have been found to negatively affect outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013484796">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1938640013484796">47</xref></sup> Only half of the studies reported the mean duration of symptoms, which makes it difficult to compare the treatment in terms of the degree of chronicity in the pathology.</p>
<p>One of the concerns of AOT is morbidity of the harvest site of the osteochondral graft, which has been reported in 2% to 50% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640013484796">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938640013484796">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938640013484796">25</xref></sup> The results from this review indicate that studies on AOT report the presence or absence of knee pain (85%) and that 95% of studies indicated where the osteochondral grafts were harvested from. However, only 15% of studies specifically indicated whether the donor site was backfilled. We recognize that this may be an underestimation because the remaining studies may have left the donor site empty, but most studies did not specifically state whether backfill was used or the donor site was left open. To gain a true understanding as to how AOT may potentiate morbidity of the donor site, it is important that all studies specify whether or not the donor site was filled. In addition, we also encourage authors to report follow-up imaging of the harvest site. In this review, 10% of studies reported an assessment of the harvest site postoperatively, with 1 additional study reporting imaging for only symptomatic patients. Studies should also report the size of grafts harvested and implanted and the number of grafts implanted. Our review indicates that 55% of studies reported the graft size, and 70% of studies reported how many grafts were used. To our knowledge, there is no study in the literature comparing the outcomes in patients who had a single graft transplanted into the talus versus those who had mosaicplasty, nor is there a study comparing the outcomes of patients who received different-sized grafts in the talus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938640013484796">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The research to date on AOT for treatment of OCLs of the talus reveals a distinct need for improvement in the reporting of certain categories, including patient history, clinical variables, imaging data, and patient-reported outcomes. Consistency in the variables reported within studies and between studies will allow for data to be collectively evaluated and ultimately pooled for meta-analysis, such that clinical relevant guidelines can be proposed. With improved consistency, it is the hope that future studies will allow for comparison of AOT with other treatment strategies for OCLs of the talus.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Studies suggest that like selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) reuptake inhibitors, antagonists at neurokinin-1 receptors (NK<sub>1</sub>Rs) may have antidepressant and anxiolytic properties. NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are present in 5-HT innervated forebrain regions which may provide a common point of interaction between these two transmitter systems. This study aimed to investigate for cellular co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT receptor subtypes in mood-related brain regions in the rat forebrain. With experiments using fluorescence immunocytochemistry, double-labelling methods demonstrated a high degree of co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in most regions examined. Co-localization was highest in the medial septum (88% NK<sub>1</sub>R expressing cells were 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-positive) and hippocampal regions (e.g. dentate gyrus, 65%), followed by the lateral/basolateral amygdala (35%) and medial prefrontal cortex (31%). In contrast, co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors was infrequent (&lt; 8%) in most areas examined except for the hippocampus (e.g. CA3, 43%). Overall co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors was much greater than that between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Thus, these experiments demonstrate a high degree of co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in cortical and limbic regions of the rat forebrain. These findings suggest a novel site of interaction between NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists and the 5-HT system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neuropeptide Substance P acts via central neurokinin-1 receptors (NK<sub>1</sub>Rs) to modulate the processing of emotional and stressful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111425969">Commons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111425969">Ebner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269881111425969">Mantyh et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0269881111425969">Nakaya et al., 1994</xref>). Pre-clinical studies showed that Substance P and NK<sub>1</sub>R agonists induced anxiety, while NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists exhibited anxiolytic and antidepressant properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111425969">Commons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0269881111425969">Papp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0269881111425969">Rotzinger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0269881111425969">Rupniak and Kramer, 1999</xref>). In support of these findings, NK<sub>1</sub>R knockout mice displayed marked reductions in anxiety and stress-related behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0269881111425969">Santarelli et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>An initial phase II clinical trial in depression showed the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist aprepitant (MK-869) to be more effective than placebo and as effective as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881111425969">Kramer et al., 1998</xref>). Although this was not borne out in a larger trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881111425969">Keller et al., 2006</xref>), the antidepressant and anxiolytic efficacy of the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist L-759,274 was confirmed in a further phase II trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881111425969">Kramer et al., 2004</xref>). Through this link with mood disorders, a recent study also investigated the role of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs in alcoholism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111425969">George et al., 2008</xref>). The study used a randomized placebo controlled experimental design to show that the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist LY686017 could suppress cravings for alcohol in recently detoxified alcoholic patients. Analogous effects of LY686017 were also seen with brain functional magnetic resonance imaging on responses to affective stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111425969">George et al., 2008</xref>). However, further studies are required to confirm the role of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs in the treatment of alcohol dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111425969">Heilig et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A human post-mortem brain study showed decreased NK<sub>1</sub>R numbers in orbitofrontal cortical regions of depressed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0269881111425969">Stockmeier et al., 2002</xref>). Another study observed a lowered ratio of superficial to deep laminar binding for NK1Rs in the anterior cingulate cortex in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111425969">Burnet and Harrison, 2000</xref>), while another post-mortem study did not show a difference in NK1R binding in the amygdala in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111425969">Carletti et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the clinical trials noted above, other studies have implicated the neurokinin system in anxiety. For example, in one study Substance P levels were found to be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111425969">Geracioti et al., 2006</xref>). A more recent positron emission tomography study showed NK<sub>1</sub>R numbers to be reduced in patients with a history of panic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111425969">Fujimura et al., 2009</xref>), and NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists have been investigated for their role in social phobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111425969">Furmark et al., 2005</xref>) and specific phobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269881111425969">Michelgard et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a well-established link between depression, anxiety disorders and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin), and a number of studies suggest that NK<sub>1</sub>Rs interact with the 5-HT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111425969">Blier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111425969">Commons et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111425969">Conley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111425969">Lacoste et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269881111425969">Maubach et al., 2002</xref>). Many of these studies have explored this interaction in mood regulating regions such as the midbrain raphe and locus coeruleus. For example, Substance P infused in vivo into the dorsal raphe nuclei was associated with decreased 5-HT cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0269881111425969">Valentino et al., 2003</xref>), while NK<sub>1</sub>R deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111425969">Conley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0269881111425969">Santarelli et al., 2001</xref>) and NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists increased neuronal firing in dorsal raphe nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111425969">Haddjeri and Blier, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, NK<sub>1</sub>R-/- mice also showed 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> somatodendritic autoreceptor desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111425969">Froger et al., 2001</xref>), similar to chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269881111425969">Riad et al., 2004</xref>) and the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist GR-205,171 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111425969">Guiard et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have also localized NK<sub>1</sub>Rs to a subpopulation of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111425969">Lacoste et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881111425969">2009</xref>). In addition, the effects of modulation of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs on 5-HT levels in the cortex have been studied. For example, intracerebral in vivo microdialysis has shown that increases in cortical 5-HT overflow caused by paroxetine were higher in freely moving NK<sub>1</sub>R-/- mutants than in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111425969">Herpfer et al., 2005</xref>), and that administration of the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist GR-205,171 to wild-type mice potentiated paroxetine-induced increases in cortical 5-HT dialysate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111425969">Guiard et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In other studies NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists increased the firing rate of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269881111425969">Maubach et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, a reciprocal interaction has been shown between the dorsal raphe nucleus and the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111425969">Gobbi et al., 2007</xref>). Both the genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs increased 5-HT neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111425969">Gobbi et al., 2007</xref>), but this increase was mediated by noradrenergic neurons: in fact a selective lesion of the noradrenergic neurons prevented the enhancement of 5-HT firing activity by NK<sub>1</sub>RAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111425969">Gobbi et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study explored the effects of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs in the lateral septum and the interaction with 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111425969">Ebner et al., 2008</xref>). The investigators found that acute administration of NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist L-822429 into the lateral septum reduced stress coping strategies in the forced swim test, and that this effect may be modulated by 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Immunocytochemical experiments in the lateral septum showed NK<sub>1</sub>Rs localized to calbindin-positive neurons, suggesting that NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists may influence 5-HT transmission indirectly via gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111425969">Ebner et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the above, little is known about the anatomical interaction of the NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT systems at the level of the forebrain. Indeed, the levels of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are high in some brain regions that receive 5-HT innervations from the midbrain raphe nuclei including the prefrontal cortex, septum, hippocampus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111425969">Barnes and Sharp, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0269881111425969">Nakaya et al., 1994</xref>). In these regions, 5-HT acts via a diversity of postsynaptic 5-HT receptor subtypes, including 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs) and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs), which are known to be important in the aetiology of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0269881111425969">Santarelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0269881111425969">Sargent et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0269881111425969">Stockmeier, 2003</xref>). It is notable that regions which are abundant in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs, such as the septum, hippocampus and frontal and entorhinal cortices, are also abundant in NK<sub>1</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111425969">Aznar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111425969">Clement et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881111425969">Kia et al., 1996c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0269881111425969">Pompeiano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0269881111425969">Wright et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs are distributed in the olfactory region, striatum, cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which also contain NK<sub>1</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111425969">Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0269881111425969">Xu and Pandey, 2000</xref>). Thus, NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and major 5-HT receptor subtypes are found in similar regions in the forebrain, which may represent a potential site of interaction between NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists, the 5-HT system and the modulation of mood.</p>
<p>The present study used double-labelling immunofluorescent microscopy to investigate the degree of cellular co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs in rat forebrain regions including the prefrontal cortex, septum, hippocampus and amygdala.</p>

<title>5-HT receptor and NK<sub>1</sub> receptor co-localization</title>
<p>One group of six adult rats (250–370 g) were examined for NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R co-localization, while in a separate experiment a second group of six adult rats (230–250 g) were examined for NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R co-localization. Rats were deeply anaesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (Merial Animal Health Ltd, Harlow, UK; 200 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 200 ml buffer (0.9% saline for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R; phosphate buffer for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) followed by about 300 ml of ice-cold fixative composed of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) and 0.4% (v/v) saturated aqueous picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.9 for 20 min.</p>
<p>For the NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R co-localization experiment, the brains were removed and post-fixed in the above solution overnight at 4°C. Brains were then cut into smaller blocks before sectioning. Coronal sections (40 µm) were prepared using a vibrating microtome (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) at rostrocaudal bregma levels of 2.70 mm, 0.70 mm and −3.30 mm according to the Paxinos and Watson atlas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111425969">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0269881111425969">Paxinos and Watson, 1998</xref>). The sections were collected as free-floating sections in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, components 0.14 M sodium chloride, 0.003 M potassium chloride, 0.01 M phosphate buffer) and after washes in PBS, stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide preservative. Following washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 90 min at room temperature in blocking buffer composed of 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) normal goat serum and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit NK<sub>1</sub>R (Chemicon, CA, USA; 1:2000; AB5060) and guinea pig 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R primary antibodies (Chemicon; 1:1000; AB5406). The sections were then washed in PBS followed by incubation in Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Netherlands; 1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes; 1:500) for 4 h at room temperature, while protected from light. All anti-sera were diluted in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. After further washes, sections were mounted from a buffer bath onto gelatine-coated glass slides, allowed to air-dry while protected from light before being cover-slipped with Vectashield liquid mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Controls included omitting the primary antibody as well as comparisons for cross-reactivity between a primary antibody and the unrelated secondary antibody.</p>

<p>For the NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R co-localization experiment, the process was as described above with minor differences. Brains were post-fixed at 4°C for 4 h and then transferred for about 36 h to 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS for cryoprotection at 4°C. Coronal sections (30 µm) were then collected via a freezing sliding microtome (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Incubation with monoclonal mouse 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R primary antibody (Pharmingen; 1:1000; #556326) was for three nights at 4°C, with rabbit NK<sub>1</sub>R primary antibody (Chemicon; 1:2000) added on the final night. The secondary antibody used for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R was Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:1000).</p>

<title>Fluorescence microscopy and histological analysis</title>
<p>Tissue sections were initially examined using a Leitz Diaplan microscope (Leica, Germany) fitted with an incident 50 Watt mercury arc lamp and equipped with epifluorescence optics and dichroic filters and viewed via a Leitz PL-Fluotar objective (× 40 numerical aperture = 0.7). Filters used were as follows: green fluorophore 420–490 excitation band-pass and 520 nm emission long-pass; red fluorophore 530–560 nm excitation band-pass and 580 nm emission long-pass.</p>
<p>Cell counts were collected at × 40 objective throughout. Cell counting was carried out on sections from the prefrontal cortex (prelimbic plus infralimbic regions), frontal cortex (regions M1 and M2), lateral septum (bilaterally) and medial septum including the diagonal band of Broca, amygdala (lateral and basolateral combined) and hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1, CA3). Cell counts for co-localized NK<sub>1</sub>R immunoreactivity (-ir) and 5-HT receptor-ir were made bilaterally on three sections, which were collected alternately to avoid counting the same cells twice. All NK<sub>1</sub>R-ir positive cells were counted in defined anatomical areas according to the Paxinos and Watson atlas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111425969">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0269881111425969">Paxinos and Watson, 1998</xref>). Percentage co-localization is presented as mean of six brains +/− standard error of the mean.</p>
<p>Digital images of sections with NK<sub>1</sub>R-ir and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R-ir double-labelling were captured using a cooled colour CCD camera (model C4742-95; Hamamatsu, Welwyn Garden City, UK) on a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) DMRB microscope with epifluorescence illumination equipped with the following filter blocks: A4 (excitation filter band-pass, 360/40 nm; reflection short-pass filter, 400 nm; suppression filter band-pass, 470/40 nm), L5 (excitation filter band-pass, 480/40 nm; reflection short-pass filter, 505 nm; suppression filter band-pass, 527/30 nm), Y3 (excitation filter band-pass, 545/30 nm; reflection short-pass filter, 565 nm; suppression filter band-pass, 610/75 nm), and Y5 (excitation filter band-pass, 620/60 nm; reflection short-pass filter, 660 nm; suppression filter B-P, 700/75 nm). Coloured digital images of sections with NK<sub>1</sub>R-ir and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-ir double-labelling were obtained using a Xillix Micro Imager camera (Xillix Technologies Corp., Canada) on the Leitz Diaplan microscope described above.</p>
<p>Images were analysed and displayed using Openlab software (version 3.1.4; Improvision, Coventry, UK). Brightness and contrast were adjusted for the entire frame, and no part of a frame was modified in any way. Digital images were manipulated with regards to size, cropping, colour balance, brightness using Photoshop 5.0 software (Adobe systems, San Jose, CA, USA) on a Power Macintosh computer and later labelled using Powerpoint (Microsoft).</p>

<title>Distribution of NK<sub>1</sub> receptor immunoreactivity</title>
<p>NK<sub>1</sub>R-ir was detected throughout the forebrain, and showed a regional distribution similar to that shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0269881111425969">Nakaya et al., 1994</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies report the presence of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs in brain regions that receive 5-HT innervations from the midbrain dorsal and median raphe nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111425969">Barnes and Sharp, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0269881111425969">Nakaya et al., 1994</xref>). However, it was not known whether NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT receptor subtypes co-localize on the same cells. The aim of the current study was to search for evidence of co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs, and between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs in the rat forebrain. This interaction may be important with regards to the antidepressant action of NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists.</p>
<p>The main findings of the present study were: (1) NK<sub>1</sub>R-ir and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R-ir were co-localized to a high degree in many forebrain regions, in particular the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex and hippocampus. Co-localization was also present in prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex and lateral and basolateral amygdala, but to a lesser degree. (2) NK<sub>1</sub>R-ir was found to co-localize with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs in hippocampal sub-regions, but not in other areas investigated. (3) The degree of co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs was much greater than that between NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs.</p>
<p>The primary antibodies used in the current study have been validated in previous work. The NK<sub>1</sub>R antibody (C-terminal amino acids 385–407; rabbit) was shown to provide specific labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111425969">Commons et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881111425969">Lacoste et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881111425969">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0269881111425969">Myohanen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0269881111425969">Nakaya et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0269881111425969">Shigemoto et al., 1993</xref>).

Furthermore, in our study, control experiments where the primary antibody was excluded did not result in any labelling.</p>
<p>The specificity of the guinea-pig polyclonal 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R antibody used in our study has been confirmed when preabsorption of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R antiserum with immunogen peptide (10<sup>−5</sup> M) corresponding to amino acids 248–262 located within the third intracellular loop of the rat 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R and the hapten thyroglobulin (0.5 mg/µl undiluted antiserum) resulted in marked reduction in immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111425969">Collin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881111425969">Luttgen et al., 2005</xref>). The pattern of immunohistochemical staining found in our study was similar to those found in other studies when using the same antibody in the same brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111425969">Collin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881111425969">Luttgen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0269881111425969">Ou et al., 2003</xref>). As in the other studies, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R-ir was predominantly seen in cell soma and occasionally also seen in dendrites.</p>
<p>In our study, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R-ir within the dentate gyrus was prominent in hilar regions, but faint in the granule cell layer, and other investigators have found similar results with other polyclonal anti-5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111425969">Gerard et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881111425969">Kia et al., 1996c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881111425969">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). However, some other studies using a polyclonal rabbit antibody to the third intracellular loop (amino acids 258–274) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111425969">Aznar et al., 2003</xref>) or an antibody raised against the second extracellular loop of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R (amino acids 170-186) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0269881111425969">Patel et al., 1996</xref>) did detect 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R-ir in hippocampal principal cells including the granule cell layer. Similarly, in the lateral septum, the current study found only weak immunostaining for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R in neurons, in concordance with one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881111425969">Luttgen et al., 2005</xref>), while another study reported strong somatodendritic staining in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881111425969">Kia et al., 1996c</xref>). Different staining patterns from the use of different antibodies may be related to differences in the epitopes recognized by the antibodies. For example, it may be that the antibody recognizing the binding site of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R (amino acids 170-186) will mostly only allow for the visualization of functionally active membrane-bound receptors, and is less likely to allow for the visualization of cytoplasmic receptors that may be in the process of synthesis or degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111425969">Anthony and Azmitia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111425969">Azmitia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111425969">Czyrak et al., 2003</xref>). However, no differences in staining patterns have been found in the hippocampus with regards to GABA neurons. Thus any differences in staining patterns on principal cells would not have a bearing on the results of our study. This is because NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are found only in GABA neurons within the rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111425969">Acsady et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0269881111425969">Sloviter et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R antibody used in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0269881111425969">Wu et al., 1998</xref>) was a monoclonal mouse antiserum generated against a recombinant hybridoma fusion protein between glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) and the first extracellular domain of the human 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R (amino acids 1–72 of the amino terminus). The hybridomas were screened by Pharmingen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunocytochemistry of frozen rat brain sections, and Western blot analysis: the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R antibody recognized the receptor as a 55-kDa band. The specificity of the band was verified by competition with a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R fusion protein and lack of competition with an irrelevant fusion protein. The supernatant was also tested against GST protein to rule out reactivity to this part of the immunogen. The antibody was purified from hybridoma culture supernatant by protein G affinity chromatography. In addition, the antibody has specifically been shown to react with human, monkey and rat 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111425969">Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998</xref>). Other investigators confirmed the specificity of the antibody by Western blot analysis of rat brain membranes, human brain and transfected NIH 3T3 cell lysates, and immunofluorescence of rat Schwann cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0269881111425969">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0269881111425969">Xu and Pandey, 2000</xref>). The antisera utilized have been characterized and applied in brain tissues, with specificity of labelling demonstrated in many different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111425969">Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111425969">Doherty and Pickel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111425969">Garlow et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111425969">Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111425969">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881111425969">Jansson et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111425969">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881111425969">Luttgen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881111425969">McDonald and Mascagni, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269881111425969">Martin-Ruiz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0269881111425969">Miner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0269881111425969">Willins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0269881111425969">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0269881111425969">Xu and Pandey, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The distribution and somatodendritic labelling of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-ir observed here was as demonstrated in many different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111425969">Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111425969">Garlow et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111425969">Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881111425969">Luttgen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269881111425969">Martin-Ruiz et al., 2001</xref>). As in a previous study, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-ir was detected in cell bodies within the septum, cells located in the pyramidal cell layers CA1-3 of the hippocampus and in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus as well as hippocampal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881111425969">Luttgen et al., 2004</xref>). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-ir was also observed in the basolateral amygdala in cell bodies and some neuronal fibres as seen before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0269881111425969">Xu and Pandey, 2000</xref>). Within the cerebral cortex, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R was highly expressed with particular staining of cell bodies and apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0269881111425969">Wu et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>For practical purposes only a limited number of brain regions were examined in this study. Also, it should be noted that as NK<sub>1</sub>R-positive neurons were generally sparse (except in the septum) cells were counted across whole anatomical areas rather than by using intra-region grids. As a consequence, although the percentage co-localization across regions can be compared, the data are not amenable to statistical comparisons.</p>
<p>A key finding of the present study was that NK<sub>1</sub>R-ir and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R-ir were co-localized to a high degree in all regions examined except for the lateral septum, with the degree of co-localization ranging from 88% (medial septum) to 31% (medial prefrontal cortex) of cells labelled with NK1R-ir in these regions. Although the study did not attempt to establish the chemical identity of the cells demonstrating co-localization of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs, this is likely to vary depending on the brain region investigated. In particular, it is likely that NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are co-localized on GABAergic neurons within the hippocampus, amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. This is because although 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are located on GABAergic neurons and pyramidal neurons within these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111425969">Aznar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111425969">Gulyas et al., 1999</xref>), NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are found only on GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111425969">Acsady et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111425969">Freund and Buzsaki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0269881111425969">Sloviter et al., 2001</xref>), basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881111425969">Levita et al., 2003</xref>) and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881111425969">Kaneko et al., 1994</xref>). On the other hand, it is likely that NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are co-localized on cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. This is because, although 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are found on cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881111425969">Kia et al., 1996a</xref>) as well as GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111425969">Aznar et al., 2003</xref>) within the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex, NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are found only on cholinergic neurons within this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111425969">Chen et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs, the degree of co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs was much less common, and this co-localization may be restricted to GABAergic neurons. This is evidenced by the fact that NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are found on GABAergic neurons within the hippocampus and amygdala, whilst 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs are found on GABAergic cells as well as dendrites of excitatory granule cells within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111425969">Geurts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111425969">Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881111425969">Luttgen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269881111425969">Meltzer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0269881111425969">Peddie et al., 2008</xref>) and dendrites of pyramidal cells in the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111425969">Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881111425969">McDonald and Mascagni, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0269881111425969">Morilak et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0269881111425969">Xu and Pandey, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the high degree of NK<sub>1</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R co-localization, it is interesting that these receptors have opposing functions at the signalling level. Thus, NK<sub>1</sub>Rs are positively coupled to phospholipase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111425969">Hamke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0269881111425969">Mitsuhashi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0269881111425969">Nakajima et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0269881111425969">Satake and Kawada, 2006</xref>) and excite neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0269881111425969">Page, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0269881111425969">Pennefather et al., 2004</xref>), whereas 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase and hyperpolarize neurons through opening G-protein-coupled K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111425969">Barnes and Sharp, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111425969">Hoyer et al., 2002</xref>). In comparison, NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs have complementary functions at the signalling level with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs, like NK<sub>1</sub>Rs, being positively coupled to phospholipase C and bringing about neuronal excitation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111425969">Barnes and Sharp, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The above predicts that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonists, NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R antagonists may have similar functional effects and there is both electrophysiological and behavioural evidence to support this. For example, the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonist 8-OH-DPAT inhibited the firing rate of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0269881111425969">Stein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0269881111425969">Wang et al., 1999</xref>), whereas the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SR140,333 suppressed Substance P-induced excitation of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111425969">Dreifuss and Raggenbass, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0269881111425969">Teixeira et al., 1996</xref>). Also, local infusions of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonists into the septum reversed helpless behaviour on the learned helplessness paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881111425969">Martin et al., 1991</xref>) and the forced swim test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0269881111425969">Schreiber and De Vry, 1993</xref>). The latter study specifically investigated infusions into the lateral septum. A more recent study showed that local administration of the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist L-822429 into the lateral septum reduced passive and facilitated active stress-coping strategies in the forced swim test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111425969">Ebner et al., 2008</xref>). The investigators suggested that this effect was mediated via increased 5-HT neurotransmission as it was blocked by intraseptal 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R antagonism. They also showed that NK<sub>1</sub>Rs were located on calbindin-positive neurons, suggesting the involvement of GABAergic interneurons in this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111425969">Ebner et al., 2008</xref>). In concordance with the results of the latter study, we did not find significant co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs in the lateral septum in our study. However, we suggest that the high percentage of co-localization in the medial septum is worth further investigation as functional studies with NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists in this brain region may show much more powerful effects than those observed in the lateral septum.</p>
<p>Studies in the amygdala showed that local infusions of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonists into the basolateral amygdala had anxiolytic effects as measured on the elevated T-maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0269881111425969">Zangrossi et al., 1999</xref>), and the contextual conditioned freezing test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881111425969">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Similar observations of anxiolysis have been made following local infusion of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>R antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111425969">Hodges et al., 1987</xref>) or NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111425969">Boyce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111425969">Ebner and Singewald, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The above animal studies resonate with the findings of the clinical effects of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonists, NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R antagonists. For example, initial phase II trials showed benefits over placebo for NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist aprepitant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881111425969">Kramer et al., 1998</xref>) with antidepressant efficacy also being observed with the NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists L-759274 (Compound A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881111425969">Kramer et al., 2004</xref>) and CP-122721 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111425969">Chappell, 2002</xref>). In a similar way, the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonist buspirone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0269881111425969">Rush et al., 2009</xref>) and atypical antipsychotics with 5-HT<sub>2</sub>R blocking properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111425969">Fontaine, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269881111425969">Millan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0269881111425969">Olver et al., 2008</xref>) have been shown to effectively augment the action of antidepressants.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study observed significant degrees of co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs in rat forebrain regions, as well as a more restricted level of co-localization between NK<sub>1</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs. These results suggest a novel cellular substrate for interactions between NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists and the 5-HT system. On the basis of known signalling effects of NK<sub>1</sub>Rs, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs, there is an interesting prediction that NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonists might have similar functional effects to 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonists and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R antagonists, and there is evidence to support this in some preclinical and clinical studies.</p>

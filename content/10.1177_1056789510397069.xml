<abstract>
<p>In this study, damage and healing mechanisms are discussed in detail with special emphasis given on two new healing variables. They are introduced in terms of healing variable based on area and healing variable based on elastic stiffness. The main objective of the introduced healing variables is to formulate the mechanical behavior of the self-healing materials and compensate the lack of physically consistent healing variables. Different healing mechanisms, existing in current self-healing systems, are characterized and for a uniaxial case of loading and isotropic material, the scalar healing variables are proposed. The performance of these new healing variables is examined for different damage-healing processes as well as coupled and uncoupled healing systems. The state of damage and healing is assumed to be isotropic for both damaged and healed states. The results show consistency with the basic concepts of the continuum damage mechanics in which introduced healing variables facilitate the self-healing materials characterization.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1056789510397069" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Self-healing of damage has been increasingly becoming a topic of intensive research recently. The current self-healing systems can be fundamentally divided into two groups: one is a coupled system or active or autonomous system in which damaging triggers self-healing; another is a de-coupled system or passive system where healing occurs after damaging is identified by external detection. Typical coupled systems include healing by microcapsules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056789510397069">White et al., 2001</xref>), hollow fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789510397069">Pang and Bond, 2005</xref>), microvascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056789510397069">Toohey et al., 2007</xref>), etc. Typical de-coupled systems include healing by incorporating thermoplastic particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056789510397069">Zako and Takano, 1999</xref>), employing thermally reversible covalent bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056789510397069">Liu and Chen, 2007</xref>), using ionomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056789510397069">Varley and van der Zwaag, 2008</xref>), utilizing confined shape recovery of shape memory polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056789510397069">Li and John, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056789510397069">John and Li, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056789510397069">Nji and Li, 2010a</xref>), and implementing a biomimic two-step close-then-heal (CTH) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056789510397069">Li and Nettles, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056789510397069">Li and Uppu, 2010</xref>). While the coupled systems, including some de-coupled systems such as incorporation of thermoplastic particles, are effective in self-healing micro-length damage, some of the de-coupled systems, such as confined shape recovery and two-step CTH systems, are designed to heal large, structural-length scale damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056789510397069">Li and Uppu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056789510397069">Nji and Li, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Constitutive models for healing mainly follow a phenomenological approach to analyze healing process such as geological rock densification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056789510397069">Miao et al., 1995</xref>) or simple models for bone remodeling or wound skin regeneration in a biological scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397069">Adam, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056789510397069">Simpson et al., 2000</xref>). A number of thermodynamic-based continuum damage-healing formulations are proposed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056789510397069">Miao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056789510397069">Barbero et al., 2005</xref>), but due to the difficulties in the experimental aspect, mechanical response modeling of self-healing materials is still under progress.</p>
<p>Material models are proposed by many researchers using elastoplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789510397069">Chaboche, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis and Thiagarajan, 1995</xref>), elasto-viscoplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789510397069">Chaboche, 1997</xref>), continuum damage mechanics (CDM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397069">Kachanov, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis and Kattan, 2009</xref>), and coupled elastoplastic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056789510397069">Lemaitre, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789510397069">Thiagarajan and Voyiadjis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056789510397069">Al-Rub and Voyiadjis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789510397069">Chow and Jie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789510397069">Ju et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789510397069">Ju and Yanase, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis et al., 2009</xref>) during the past decades. In the case of damage mechanics, the damage variable (or tensor) represents the average material degradation. The damage variable represents the various types of damage at the micro-scale level, like micro-cracks, voids, and micro-cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056789510397069">Lubarda and Krajcinovic, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis and Kattan, 2009</xref>). Two independent damage variables are required to describe accurately the case of isotropic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789510397069">Cauvin and Testa, 1999</xref>), but it has been argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789510397069">Lemaitre, 1984</xref>) that the assumption of isotropic damage gives sufficient accuracy to predict the load-carrying capacity, the number of cycles, or the time to local failure in structural components.</p>
<p>In CDM, the concept of representative volume element (RVE) is used, while the discontinuities such as micro-cracks and voids are not considered within the RVE. The concept of macroscopic internal variables is used to lump the effect of all damages and in this way, a thermodynamic consistent formulation is obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056789510397069">Hansen and Schreyer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056789510397069">Miao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis and Kattan, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397069">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To formulate the healing process, the nature of the healing system should be defined that is a function of many parameters according to the specific healing method which is used. Types of damages and types of constituent material are other important factors during this analysis. In summary, one may mention self-healing system proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056789510397069">White et al. (2001)</xref> which incorporates microencapsulated healing agent inside the polymeric composites. Solidification of the healing agent within the microcracks or nucleated voids contributes to heal the damages. In this system, damaging (crack propagation) fractures the microcapsules and triggers the healing process so that damaging and healing are coupled. Another system is a two-step CTH system proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056789510397069">Li and Nettles (2010)</xref> and detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056789510397069">Li and Uppu (2010)</xref>, which mimics the self-healing process of biological systems such as self-healing of human skin. In this system, the confined shape recovery of shape memory polymer is used to narrow or close crack and thermoplastic particle is used for achieving molecular-length scale healing. Through proper training or programming, the shape memory functionality can be utilized to close structural-length scale damage (crack) such as impact damage. This is advantageous over the coupled systems as the coupled systems can only heal micro-length scale damage. However, the healing process is not triggered autonomously. Some human interventions such as identification of damage by external detection and external heating are needed. Therefore, this CTH system belongs to de-coupled or passive healing system.</p>
<p>No matter coupled or de-coupled healing systems, healing can be described in the framework of CDM. This is because healing causes a reduction of the volume of damage and an increase in the stiffness of the material. In order to keep generality, in this research, general physical meaning of the damage and healing processes for the uniaxial case is considered without targeting any specific healing system or any specific material or damage type. The damaged and healed configurations are assumed to be isotropic and no anisotropy has been considered for the virgin material. The proposed healing variables are capturing the healing effect by two distinctive measurement methods that are addressed by direct and indirect methods here. In the direct method, the healing process is observed by the measurement of the effective cross-section changes after the healing, while the indirect method captures elastic stiffness changes in order to calibrate the healing. The relationships between classical damage variables with these new healing variables are derived here to facilitate damage and healing measurements in a self-healing system.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to introduce new physical-based healing variables to provide a tool for modeling the mechanical responses of self-healing materials. The final goal of this research is to fully establish self-healing material responses under different loading conditions. The basic concept of CDM is revised herein to capture the role of the healing process.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1056789510397069"><title>SCALAR HEALING VARIABLES</title>
<p>In this section, the concept of effective and real configurations in the case of damage-healing is introduced and two new healing variables are formulated based on basic concepts of CDM. The major advantage of CDM is that it utilizes a continuous damage variable in the process zone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397069">Kachanov (1958)</xref> was the first to introduce such a continuous variable related to the density of defects and later it has been used widely by many researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis and Kattan (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397069">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056789510397069">2010</xref>). Further damage variables have been introduced such as changes in the elastic constants due to damage mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397069">Kachanov, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis and Kattan, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056789510397069">2010</xref>), or surface energy change in order to describe the material deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056789510397069">Hansen and Schreyer, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>At first, a scalar healing variable for the uniaxial healing process is investigated in order to propose a direct method to capture the healing effect. The same approach introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397069">Kachanov (1958)</xref> for the damage measurement is followed here to formulate a scalar healing variable to measure the changes in density of defects. For this purpose, the concept of effective configuration, in the framework of CDM, is modified here to capture the effect of healing.</p>
<p>In CDM framework, the initial undeformed and undamaged configuration of the body is shown by <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub>, and the damaged and deformed configuration is represented by <italic>C</italic>. The effective configuration is a fictitious state where all damages including microcracks and voids have been removed from the deformed body and it is shown by <inline-formula id="ilm3-1056789510397069"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-1056789510397069"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789510397069">Figure 1</xref>, these configurations are depicted schematically. For the case of isotropic damage and using the basic concept of the effective state, the damage variable is defined as a scalar in the following manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397069">Kachanov, 1958</xref>):

<p>Accordingly, the damage parameters based on the area reduction are hard to calibrate in practical applications. The measurement of the cross-section area reduction due to damage or cross-section area increase due to healing involves precise measurement of micro-cracks and micro-voids which is hard to implement and requires advanced mathematical and mapping techniques. In order to facilitate the damage and healing measurement, an indirect measurement method for the damage, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056789510397069">Lemaitre and Dufailly (1987)</xref>, is modified here to facilitate the damage and healing measurements. This new healing variable for the uniaxial case of healing is introduced based on the elastic modulus changes. The formulation for this healing variable follows the same trend as the scalar damage variable introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056789510397069">Voyiadjis and Kattan (2010)</xref>.

<p>The introduced new healing variables can capture the coupled continuum damage-healing processes as well as the de-coupled continuum damage and healing processes. This concept is interesting because some of the present self-healing systems are either coupled or de-coupled.</p>
<p>These healing variables can measure the healing effect while both healing and damaging processes are active (coupled continuum damage-healing process), such as the microencapsulated self-healing systems proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056789510397069">White et al. (2001)</xref>. In these systems, when damage reaches a certain value, the microcapsules are cracked and the healing agent is released to heal the microcracks and voids. One may consider such a system as a coupled damage–healing system where damage and healing processes are concurrently activated. Coupled systems may use hollow fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789510397069">Pang and Bond, 2005</xref>), and microvascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056789510397069">Toohey et al., 2007</xref>), etc.</p>
<p>Besides, the introduced healing variables can measure healing and damaging effects separately, when only one of these processes is active (de-coupled continuum damage-healing process). The de-coupled systems require additional processes to accomplish the healing process, such as heating.

<p>The performance of the new introduced uniaxial healing variables is evaluated here for both the coupled and the uncoupled damage–healing processes. In the case of elastic strain energy equivalence, the relation between the damage variables and the healing variables is introduced in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula16-1056789510397069">16</xref>). The effect of healing is studied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1056789510397069">Figure 6</xref>. The state of fully damaged configuration is obtained by setting the healing variables in such a way to eliminate the healing effect (<italic>h</italic> = 1, <inline-formula id="ilm145-1056789510397069"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math145-1056789510397069"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). The effect of healing parameter <italic>h</italic> is then evaluated for three different healing values such as: <italic>h</italic> = 0.8, 05, and 0.3, and the healing variable <inline-formula id="ilm149-1056789510397069"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math149-1056789510397069"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is kept zero.

However, in the case of the healed configuration, this limiting value is increased and the material can sustain more damage based on the definition of φ with respect to the unhealed material.

<p>The mechanics of the damage and healing processes for the uniaxial case of loading is investigated in which different healing strategies are mathematically formulated for self-healing materials. Using CDM framework, two new healing variables for uniaxial case are presented. The concept of effective configuration is modified in order to be able to capture the healing effect. The virgin, damaged, and healed configurations are assumed to be isotropic. The exact relations between the two scalar damage variables and two scalar healing variables are derived for the uniaxial case for both hypotheses of elastic strain equivalence and elastic strain energy equivalence. Using a thermodynamic consistent approach the evolution laws for the damage and healing variables are obtained. The effect of healing on the upper bound of classical damage variable φ is investigated. Moreover, the performance of the introduced healing variables is investigated for the coupled and uncoupled damage–healing processes. The proposed healing variables can describe the healing effect efficiently for both of the coupled and uncoupled damage–healing systems, and they show consistency with the published results on CDM. They can be used in future modeling and experimental works to define the self-healing material mechanical responses under different loading conditions.</p></sec>

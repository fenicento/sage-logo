<abstract>
<p>Numerous models are employed for medication distribution and pharmacy services management in correctional facilities. Since 2003, the University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy and the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) have collaborated on a pharmacy management program designed to better integrate medical care, improve medication utilization, and reduce pharmaceuticals costs. The program introduced staff education, waste-reduction strategies, treatment protocols, and a responsive formulary system. RIDOC pharmaceutical expenditures grew at a rate of approximately 1.5% Per Inmate Per Year from 2003 to 2009, considerably below the annual pharmaceutical inflation rate. Analyses of projected and actual drug spending indicate that RIDOC benefited from savings of almost $5 million during this period. This innovative approach to pharmacy management addressed many pharmaceutical care issues that had challenged RIDOC while providing educational opportunities for doctor of pharmacy students in this practice setting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the country, state correctional systems rely on a variety of models for the provision of pharmaceutical care to inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345811421732">Kingston et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345811421732">Roberts &amp; Keith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421732">Simpson &amp; Shah, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345811421732">Smith &amp; Hopper, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421732">U.S. Department of Justice, 2005</xref>). Frequently, these models share two clear and distinct functions. The distributive function involves the process of ordering, delivering, and distributing prescribed medication to an inmate. The management function includes the coordination of the clinical aspects of pharmacy practice; the assurance of cost-effective, quality pharmaceutical care; and the efficient use of pharmaceutical resources.</p>
<p>Some correctional models assign responsibility for both functions to a single entity, while others divide responsibility among two or more providers. The Federal Bureau of Prisons uses a uniform delivery and service approach: The federal prisons have created a national formulary, centralized administrative functions, and assured significant on-site pharmacist presence to provide care to inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345811421732">U.S. Department of Justice, 2007</xref>). In contrast, many state correctional facilities and jails employ several options for assuring comprehensive pharmacy services. These options include in-house management of the pharmaceutical distribution system by correctional pharmacy employees, outsourcing to other state agencies or for-profit entities specializing in correctional pharmacy, or a combination of the two approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345811421732">American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421732">Simpson &amp; Shah, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The privatization of correctional facility services has led to a greater role for for-profit pharmacies. Several of these pharmacies have service agreements with correctional facilities for distributive and management services. The availability of overnight pharmacy delivery, e-prescribing, and electronic medical record (EMR) facilitates the transfer of information to one or multiple vendors providing pharmaceutical services without the need for an on-site pharmacy. The correctional facilities benefit from volume buying and economies of scale as well as technological advances offered by these vendors, which is critical when considering the constraints of shrinking correctional budgets. Although health care spending inflation in 2007 was the lowest recorded in the last decade at 6.1%, the cost of pharmaceuticals continues to impact health care expenditures in correctional facilities. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345811421732">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary (2008)</xref>, U.S. drug expenditures increased 8.6% in 2006 and 4.9% in 2007 compared to a yearly average of 9.4% from 2001 to 2006. Approximately half of this moderation in drug spending may be accounted for by increased use of generics and slower growth in the cost of branded prescription drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345811421732">Hartman, Martin, McDonnell, &amp; Catlin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The significant economic advantage to outsourcing the distribution function has attracted many correctional facilities to this option, while the management of pharmaceutical care remains an on-site service. Correctional facilities may employ pharmacy managers, pharmacists, or pharmacy consultants to manage their contract with the off-site private pharmacy. These individuals also frequently provide drug utilization review, pharmacy and therapeutics committee leadership, formulary development, drug returns and destruction, and compliance with state and federal laws and regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345811421732">Keith &amp; Coffey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345811421732">State of Wisconsin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Medical and pharmacy schools occasionally collaborate with correctional facilities on a number of medical care responsibilities. These may include provision of direct services, training of health care students, clinical research, cost-effectiveness analysis, and case management of inmate health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421732">Kraut, Haddix, Carande-Kulis, &amp; Greifinger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078345811421732">Varghese &amp; Peterman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421732">Veysey &amp; Bichler-Robertson, 2002</xref>). However, it is uncommon to find an educational institution coordinating and managing the delivery of pharmaceutical care in correctional environments.</p>
<p>In 2002, the State of Rhode Island developed a model of collaboration between the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) and the Healthcare Utilization Management Center (HUMC) at the University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy (URICOP). The goals of this relationship were as follows: (a) use the broad scope of professional resources available at the URICOP to provide quality, cost-effective pharmaceutical care to RIDOC inmates and (b) apply managed care and evidenced-based strategies to optimally allocate pharmacy resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1078345811421732">
<title>Healthcare Utilization Management Center</title>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the URICOP committed to the development of the program in pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics, an area of pharmacy practice that focuses on research in the fields of economics and epidemiology. The HUMC was formed as the service arm of this program to provide doctor of pharmacy and graduate students with “real-world” experience in managing the pharmaceutical component of the health care system. The faculty of the HUMC has had extensive experience in managing pharmaceutical care issues in managed care and institutional settings as well as involvement in correctional facility pharmaceutical care delivery. This experience, combined with state-of-the-art information and reporting systems, enables the HUMC to assist the RIDOC in managing its pharmaceutical care program while offering educational opportunities to pharmacy students in their final academic year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1078345811421732">
<title>Rhode Island Department of Corrections</title>
<p>The RIDOC operates seven facilities (intake, minimum security, maximum security, medium security [two], high security, and women) on its Cranston, RI, campus. More than 100 health care professionals employed by the health care services unit are charged with providing medical, psychiatric, and dental services to more than 18,000 inmates. Since Rhode Island does not maintain a county or town-based jail system, the RIDOC serves as the detention center for the state.</p>
<p>In March 2009, the facilities housed approximately 3,500 inmates, of whom 5% were women. Whites (47%), Blacks (29%), and Hispanics (21%) constituted the vast majority of the incarcerated population. This population is disproportionately affected by diseases such as HIV (1.19% of inmates), hepatitis C (0.22% of inmates), and psychiatric illnesses (27.53% of inmates; RIDOC Monthly Pharmacy Utilization Reports, 2002-2009). Inmate turnover is relatively frequent, with 60% of inmates sentenced to 6 months or less and only 6% serving life sentences.</p>
<p>However, the RIDOC’s population is beginning to see the effects of inmates serving longer sentences, mirroring national trends. The national population of elderly inmates increased from 41,586 in 1991 to 113,358 in 2002, while Per Inmate Per Year (PIPY) costs of incarcerating these individuals was noted to be more than 3 times that of younger inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345811421732">Abner, 2006</xref>). Researchers routinely categorize inmates over the age of 50 or 55 as “elderly” due to the effects of alcoholism, drug abuse, and poor diet and medical care prior to imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345811421732">Rikard &amp; Rosenberg, 2007</xref>). The RIDOC 2009 census reports 13.2% of the sentenced population as over 50 years of age and 25% between the ages of 40 and 49 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421732">RIDOC, 2009b</xref>). The expected higher incidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease in this aging population will add to the burden of disease managed by health care providers. During the period from 1994 to 2008, the state’s prison population increased by nearly 40%, and the median age of a male prisoner in 2009 was 35 years (range, 17-86; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345811421732">RIDOC, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2003, the RIDOC transitioned from an in-house pharmacy to an outsourced vendor program. Under this transitional model, medication was shipped daily to the facilities from a pharmacy specializing in correctional health care. Consultant pharmacists provided clinical services and operational oversight. During this period, the RIDOC noted an increase in pharmaceutical utilization and spending, which rose to an average of $685 PIPY by 2003. This period coincided with the following operational problems:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Service issues: Missing medications, incorrect orders, and stock outages were common. These issues resulted in the excessive use of emergency prescriptions being ordered through a local provider and increased nursing costs.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Drug waste: Medications for released inmates were destroyed with no credit allowable from the vendor due to state regulations.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Utilization management: An open formulary allowed for prescribing without regard to cost.</p>
</list-item>
</list>In an effort to continue to treat inmates within a continually tight budget, the RIDOC developed two requests for proposals, one for the pharmaceutical product (distributive function) and one for pharmacy program management (the management function). This competitive bidding process sought to lower costs for both the pharmaceutical product and pharmacy dispensing. Correctional Pharmacy Services (CPS) of Hatboro, PA, was selected as the pharmaceutical product vendor, and the HUMC was chosen to manage the pharmacy program. Since the initial contract was awarded in 2003, with renewals in 2006 and 2010, the pharmacy management model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345811421732">Figure 1</xref>) has evolved in many ways to address critical operational issues.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078345811421732">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The HUMC developed the following plan to address the operational areas identified by the health care administration of the RIDOC:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Program administration: Develop a team of medical personnel, including RIDOC administrators, physicians, and nurses, the dispensing pharmacists (CPS), and HUMC staff, that meets regularly to review prescribing and formulary product selection.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Policies and procedures: (a) Develop and implement health care policies and procedures consistent with state regulations and the RIDOC correctional policies, and (b) ensure that policies and procedures are disseminated and reviewed by health care personnel.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Reporting: (a) Use the HUMC analytical programming resources to develop reports related to medication cost and utilization that model data to RIDOC specifications, and (b) using SAS<sup>®</sup> software, create reports that the RIDOC can use internally to aid cost-effective clinical and management decision making and externally to support the state budgeting and legislative process.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Purchasing: (a) Review the formulary quarterly to ensure that the products meet clinical and cost parameters for the program, (b) monitor the introduction of generics and move patients to these products as soon as there is a cost advantage to the RIDOC, and (c) identify high-cost patients and ensure that the products and purchasing venue minimize cost to the RIDOC.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Medication stock: Secure approval from the Board of Pharmacy to allow each facility to have a limited supply of medications routinely used for medication stock. These medications will be used for new admissions or medication orders placed during weekends and holidays.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Medication disposal: Quantify the level of medical waste and implement strategies to use the discarded medications as stock medication instead of disposal and reduce the days supplied for specific therapeutic classes as well as for nonsentenced inmates.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Medication administration: Work with the nursing staff to ensure that medication is being distributed efficiently and effectively while maintaining inmate safety at all times. This includes the medication administration in-service training, review and maintenance of the medication administration documentation system and policy, and development of procedures.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Although many of the outcomes of this affiliation are qualitative in nature, a number of economic parameters, including overall ingredient costs, PIPY drug expenditure, PIPY drug utilization, and per prescription costs, were monitored. RIDOC trend data were compared to national data using actual and projected national expenditures for prescription drugs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078345811421732">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Over the period of fiscal years 2003 to 2009, the RIDOC documented stabilization in expenditures for pharmaceuticals in the correctional medical program. Overall prescription costs increased from $2.2 million in 2001 to $2.7 million in 2009, while PIPY spending was $685 and $749, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345811421732">Table 1</xref>). These moderate increases occurred in the face of significant increases in the prison population, an advancing median age of the inmates, and pharmaceutical inflation. There was a slight decrease in the cost per prescription over this time frame ($24.63 in 2002 vs. $23.95 in 2009). The difference between projected and actual drug spending reflects savings of about $4.9 million for the period of 2003 to 2009.</p>

<p>The prevalence of antipsychotic use increased from 20.9% in January 2005 to 26.6% in January 2009 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078345811421732">Table 3</xref>). Monthly costs for all antipsychotics increased from $46,165 in 2005 to $67,003 in 2007, with an increasing proportion of costs allocated for atypical antipsychotics. Expenditures for these newer agents peaked in 2008 at a cost of $56 per antipsychotic inmate and have since moderated to $42 per inmate as the RIDOC benefited from the approval of generic risperidone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078345811421732">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, medication waste, defined as nonscheduled medication destroyed due to inmate release or a change in drug regimen, decreased over three survey periods. In 2006 and 2008, medications costing $472,645 and $189,205, respectively, were estimated to have been destroyed. Based on data from a 2-month survey period in early 2010, medication costing approximately $98,699 will be destroyed over the 2010 calendar year.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The unique model discussed in this article provides opportunities to pursue several creative medical care strategies. The RIDOC has documented considerable savings on pharmaceutical costs in its inmate population since applying pharmacy benefit management techniques such as formularies, clinical protocols, disease state management programs, and extensive data analysis and evaluation under the direction of the HUMC. The correctional system certainly benefited from a moderation in medication costs nationally. Given these national trends from 2003 to 2009, the strategies employed in this model enhanced RIDOC’s savings as evidenced by an estimated 25% lower than expected PIPY drug cost. These savings are critical, given that a recent Pew report noted that Rhode Island spent $44,860 PIPY, the highest of any state in the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421732">Pew Center on the States, 2009</xref>). Anecdotal evidence suggests that the system is more efficient, health care team-oriented, and patient-focused. Attention to proper care of behavioral health, HIV, and hepatitis C issues continues to be of great importance in the incarcerated environment.</p>
<p>The development of a working team to deliver pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical care to inmates is critical to the success of this model. At one level, the involvement of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in the formulary management and drug distribution process assures “buy-in” by key stakeholders. These individuals are invested in making the system work efficiently, problem solving to overcome daily obstacles, and developing disease management strategies that benefit patient care. At a second level, a healthy relationship between the program managers and the dispensing pharmacy is also essential. Effective communication between the two entities, on a daily basis via telephone and e-mail, is of particular importance.</p>
<p>The alignment of incentives is often an overlooked component of the pharmacy management strategy. For example, the RIDOC model remunerates the dispensing pharmacy on a per-inmate-per-month basis for services in providing prescription medication and reimburses the pharmacy for medication ingredients at their actual purchase price. The dispensing pharmacy does not receive a per-prescription dispensing fee. This compensation formula eliminates incentives to fill more prescriptions to maximize dispensing fees or to dispense medication that might be more costly for RIDOC but more profitable to the dispensing pharmacy.</p>
<p>As the RIDOC model evolves, an important direction is the implementation of an EMR that better integrates the pharmacy component with the data germane to the rest of the inmate’s medical care. This promises even greater operational efficiencies, more effective communication of formulary guidelines and clinical protocols to physicians, and enhanced evaluation and feedback of health care outcomes. To this end, implementation of RIDOC’s EMR began in the spring of 2009 and it is now fully functional.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to highlight the educational aspect of this model. The involvement of sixth-year pharmacy students in the care and treatment of inmates provides a valuable learning experience for these new practitioners. The RIDOC benefits from the students’ strong clinical knowledge base, enthusiasm, and creative thinking. Pharmacy students on rotation in the HUMC experience the challenges of providing care in this unique correctional environment, as well as the professional fulfillment that comes from interacting with other health professionals for the advancement of patient health. Graduate students in the program gain valuable real-world data analysis skills and exposure to the complex field of pharmacy management.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Several scholars have asserted that the underrepresentation of minority students in gifted and talented education (GATE) programs is the result of biased assessment practices. However, an examination of the psychometric properties of scores on cognitive ability, achievement tests, and rating scales do not support these claims. We contend that the underrepresentation of some racial/ethnic groups in GATE program is another manifestation of the longstanding and intractable achievement gap in the United States. Although we agree that the goal of having more equitable representation of the school population in GATE programs is laudable, we argue that the solution is one that needs to come from policy changes rather than changes in assessment instruments. We provide recommendations for identifying gifted students who may be at a disadvantage because of their group membership and illustrate this process using recent data from a summer program for academically talented students.</p>

<p>For several decades, scholars have commented on the underrepresentation of African American, American Indian, and Hispanic/Latino students in gifted and talented education (GATE) programs relative both to their representation in the population and to their European American and East and South Asian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734282911428197">Ford, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911428197">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911428197">Ford &amp; Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911428197">Michael-Chadwell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734282911428197">Worrell, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0734282911428197">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734282911428197">2009b</xref>). Nationally, European American students comprise approximately 56% of the total school population but almost 68% of the students in GATE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734282911428197">U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, 2006</xref>). Similarly, Asian American students make up less than 5% of the total school population but account for almost 10% of GATE students. In contrast, although African American students make up 17% of the school population, they are only 9% of GATE students, and Hispanic American students account for 20% of the total school population but only 12% of GATE students. The numbers for American Indian students are 1.26% of the general population and 0.97% of the GATE population.</p>
<p>A closer examination of Asian American students reveals differences among these ethnic subgroups. Data suggest that some Southeast Asians and Pacific Islander groups are underrepresented in GATE programs relative to their East and South Asian peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734282911428197">Kitano &amp; DiJiosia, 2002</xref>), as the former groups often have parents with lower educational levels and less financial resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734282911428197">Park, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734282911428197">2003</xref>). The disproportionate representation of ethnic/racial minorities is even starker in many urban areas. For example, in San Francisco, African American students comprise 18% of the student population yet account for only 5% of students classified as gifted, whereas European American students account for 14% of the total student population and 25% of students in GATE programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911428197">Graham, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some of the commentaries have merely described the underrepresentation, others have attributed the underrepresentation to assessment practices in part. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734282911428197">Ford (1995</xref>, 1998) identified several factors that are believed to be responsible for the disproportionate ethnic/racial representation in GATE programs. These include (a) narrow definitions of giftedness, (b) using standardized cognitive and achievement tests as criteria for identification, (c) differences in cultural learning styles, (d) the inability of teachers to recognize giftedness, (e) parental mistrust of schools, (f) academic underachievement on the part of gifted students, (g) failure to consider multiple intelligences, (h) schools with little resources, and (i) the characteristics and training of assessment personnel. In this article, we briefly discuss the construct of giftedness, provide an overview of the major assessment tools used to identify students for GATE programs, evaluate the criticisms of these tools that have implications for assessment, provide some recommendations for assessing minority students for GATE programs, and examine data related to the identification and performance of minority students in a gifted program.</p>
<sec id="section1-0734282911428197">
<title>Defining Giftedness</title>
<p>Much of the controversy in this area stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the construct of giftedness. That is, giftedness is perceived to be a trait that some individuals possess and some do not. Moreover, the trait is presumed to exist in equal proportions across all demographic groups, leading to the assumption that any gifted program that does not reflect the demographic makeup of the district or school is somehow biased. However, whether in athletics, academics, the performing arts, or any other endeavor, giftedness is not about the potential that you have in the domain; rather, giftedness is the manifestation of that potential through actual accomplishments in the real world. In other words, giftedness is not about who you are but what you <italic>do</italic> (see Pfeiffer article in this issue). The importance of accomplishment as the hallmark of giftedness is succinctly stated in a position paper on the website of The National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Gifted individuals are those who demonstrate outstanding levels of aptitude (defined as an exceptional ability to reason and learn) or competence (documented performance or achievement in top 10% or rarer) in one or more domains. Domains include any structured area of activity with its own symbol system (e.g., mathematics, music, language) and/or set of sensorimotor skills (e.g., painting, dance, sports). . . . Exceptionally capable learners are children who progress in learning at a significantly faster pace than do other children of the same age, often resulting in high levels of achievement. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734282911428197">NAGC, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this quotation makes clear, individuals who are labeled gifted are at the upper end of the distribution of achievement or potential for achievement (i.e., aptitude) in any domain (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734282911428197">Worrell, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734282911428197">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this definition is quite broad and does not prescribe the criteria that we should use for identification. The definition also includes academic and nonacademic domains. Given that (a) regular public schools are typically focused on and best suited for developing academic gifts and (b) the identification of nonacademic gifts (e.g., music, dance, basketball) does not rely on psychoeducational assessments, this article will focus on academic giftedness.</p>

<title>Measures of Achievement</title>
<p>Given our focus on academic giftedness, the question becomes what assessment instruments should we use to identify students. Although often ignored, it is a well-established finding that the best predictor of current or future academic achievement is previous achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734282911428197">Antonak, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911428197">Au, Watkins, &amp; Hattie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734282911428197">Conklin &amp; Ogston, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911428197">Lunneborg, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734282911428197">Salanova, Schaufeli, Martinez, &amp; Bresó, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734282911428197">Scannell, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0734282911428197">Tai, Liu, Maltese, &amp; Fan, 2006</xref>), especially in the <italic>same</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734282911428197">Busch, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734282911428197">Hemmings &amp; Kay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734282911428197">Pursell, 2007</xref>). Moreover, this finding has been replicated in longitudinal studies of gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734282911428197">Lubinski, Benbow, Webb, &amp; Bleske-Rechek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911428197">Lubinski, Webb, Morelock, &amp; Benbow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734282911428197">Wai, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0734282911428197">Wai, Lubinski, Benbow, &amp; Steiger, 2010</xref>). Thus, the best predictor of mathematics performance in Grade 6 is mathematics performance in an earlier grade.</p>
<p>Teachers are often asked to nominate the students in their classroom who demonstrate, or have the potential to demonstrate, giftedness. However, this request is related to the fallacy of giftedness as a trait or set of characteristics that are evident and easily identifiable. As teachers have ongoing and multiple opportunities to observe student performance in a variety of situations and are frequently engaged in evaluations of student work products, it might be less subjective to require teachers to nominate the students who are doing the best academic work. Outstanding academic work can be operationalized in a variety of ways, including regularly getting the highest scores on in-class assignments and tests or on end-of-semester examinations and projects, providing creative or innovative solutions to problems, or demonstrating the capacity for persistence and flexibility when faced with academic challenges.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a gifted referral may be triggered by student performance on the standardized tests administered by the state or federal government or by a parent referral. In most cases, the referral results in a more detailed evaluation of a student’s capabilities using individually administered instruments. There are several individually administered tests of achievement with strong validity evidence that allow educators to get a better understanding of students’ strengths in the broad areas of reading, mathematics, and writing (e.g., the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734282911428197">Pearson, 2009]</xref>, the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0734282911428197">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>]).</p>
<p>The national talent search programs, which identify students for enriched and accelerated summer programs, use the verbal and quantitative sections of the SAT to do above-grade-level testing with students from as young as the upper elementary or middle school grades (see Assouline &amp; Lupklowski-Shoplik, this issue). The SAT, which is used primarily to assess students’ readiness for pursuing an undergraduate degree, is particularly useful for elementary and middle school students who are quite advanced in the verbal and quantitative domains, as this instrument is less subject to ceiling effects for these ages. This use of the SAT is also an excellent example of above-grade-level testing, which involves administering to younger students a test designed to assess achievement in older students to see how they perform. Above-grade-level testing can also conducted with school-based examinations (e.g., giving an Algebra I examination to a Grade 3 student who is showing exceptional mathematical ability).</p>

<title>Tests of Cognitive Ability</title>
<p>We are not only interested in identifying students who are currently doing well academically but also interested in identifying students who have the potential to do well. Ironically, the tests that are most often criticized—intelligence tests—are some of the best measures of potential available. The predictive validity of intelligence or cognitive measures for academic achievement is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734282911428197">Neisser et al., 1996</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282911428197">Brody (1997)</xref> commented, “IQ scores are related to the acquisition of knowledge in school and occupational settings” (p. 1046), perhaps because the tests were specifically designed to measure scholastic aptitude. Indeed, IQ is often the second best predictor of achievement in all academic domains. Thus, IQ is a more general predictor than other variables, as it can predict performance in reading, mathematics, science, and other academic areas. It is important to note, however, that the relationship between IQ and schooling is neither simple nor unidirectional: IQ affects schooling, and schooling affects IQ as well. In other words, those with higher IQs stay in school longer, but staying in school also benefits IQ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734282911428197">Ceci &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>, for an exposition of this argument).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734282911428197">
<title>Rating Scales</title>
<p>Another set of assessment tools that are often used in the identification process includes rating scales specifically developed for identifying gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734282911428197">Worrell &amp; Schaefer, 2004</xref>). These scales, some of which have national norms, provide a structured way for teachers to provide information on students across a variety of constructs associated with outstanding achievement such as motivation. Although there are a substantial number of these scales, the psychometric properties of scores on these instruments vary widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734282911428197">Jarosewich, Pfeiffer, &amp; Morris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734282911428197">Worrell &amp; Schaefer, 2004</xref>). To date, only scores on the Gifted Rating Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734282911428197">Pfeiffer &amp; Jarosewich, 2003</xref>) have shown substantial evidence of diagnostic efficiency and have been examined in several cultural groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734282911428197">Li, Lee, Pfeiffer, Kamata, &amp; Kumtepe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734282911428197">Pfeiffer &amp; Jarosewich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734282911428197">Pfeiffer &amp; Petscher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734282911428197">Pfeiffer, Petscher, &amp; Jarosewich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911428197">Pfeiffer, Petscher, &amp; Kumtepe, 2008</xref>), although some of these findings are based on extremely small sample sizes of minority students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734282911428197">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In short, prior achievement is the best predictor of future achievement that we have. IQ is the second best predictor, and gifted assessments typically use IQ scores and achievement tests in determining whether a child should be classified as gifted or not. However, minority students obtain lower scores on both of these measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911428197">Ford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734282911428197">Worrell, 2009b</xref>). There is limited evidence on racial/ethnic group differences on Gifted Rating Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734282911428197">Pfeiffer et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911428197">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734282911428197">Pfeiffer &amp; Jarosewich, 2007</xref>), although it is probable that the differences evident in IQ test scores are present on these forms as they use IQ as a basis for establishing validity.</p>
<p>This brings us to one of the central criticisms raised about minority underrepresentation in gifted programs:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The heavy or exclusive reliance on tests poses major problems for African American, American Indian, and Hispanic American students, all of whom have a history of performing poorly on these tests. . . . More recently, educators have begun to question the validity and reliability of these tests . . . [as] issues affecting the reliability and validity of tests can result in biases against minority students. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911428197">Ford, 1998</xref>, p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In reality, this statement ignores a profound truth. The tests do not pose problems for these students. The tests reflect accurately the students’ lower level of attained academic competencies than their peers—that is, the ubiquitous achievement gap—and lead to lower placement rates in GATE programs. In the next section, we examine the claim of bias and our rejection of this claim.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734282911428197">
<title>Are Standardized Tests Biased Toward Underrepresented Minority Groups?</title>
<p>In measurement terms, this type of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911428197">Ford, 1998</xref>) refers to systematic error in test scores on the basis of group membership. In other words, group membership (e.g., being African American or Hispanic/Latino) introduces construct-irrelevant variance into the scores, with the scores reflecting the examinee’s demographic background in addition to or rather than the construct being assessed (e.g., reading, mathematics, intelligence). The American Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association (APA), and National Council on Measurement in Education (NMCE; 1999) have outlined several sources of bias in tests, including those related to content and responses as well as issues in prediction and selection.</p>
<p>Content-related bias refers to whether questions or instructions from tests are unfair for a specific group (or groups). For instance, ethnic minority students may be less familiar with the content of items on a test than their majority peers, may provide incorrect answers that would be considered <italic>correct</italic> in the context of their culture, or may have simply not been afforded the opportunity to learn the test’s content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0734282911428197">Reynolds &amp; Carson, 2005</xref>). Today, there are many sophisticated procedures for detecting bias at the item level or differential item functioning (DIF), and these procedures are routinely used to exclude problematic items from tests. With regard to structural bias, factor analyses of the instruments reveal similar internal structures across ethnic groups, supporting the hypothesis that these tests are tapping the same construct across ethnic groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734282911428197">Kush et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734282911428197">Roid, 2003</xref>). A third area of potential bias is predictive. All things being equal, tests should be able to accurately predict performance in the construct that they measure. In statistical terms, regression equations relating to the test and the construct being assessed should not differ between groups if no bias exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734282911428197">AERA et al., 1999</xref>), and examinations of the major standardized instruments have found no evidence of bias against the underrepresented groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734282911428197">Frisby &amp; Braden, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, standardized tests of intelligence effectively measure the constructs that they purport to measure across all ethnic and racial groups and across all achievement levels. To the extent that these measures predict school performance, it would be unreasonable to exclude them for the purpose of gifted identification. We do claim, however, that neither are the constructs assessed by these tools the sole predictors of giftedness or academic achievement nor should they be the sole criteria for gifted identification. Instead, we argue that multiple sources of evidence should always be used in making decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0734282911428197">Worrell, 2009a</xref>), a position recommended by several prominent organizations in the field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734282911428197">AERA et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734282911428197">NAGC, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734282911428197">National Research Council, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>The Importance of Multiple Sources of Information</title>
<p>Given the broad view of giftedness introduced earlier in the article and the validity evidence supporting the use of IQ and other tests in making predictions about academic performance, how do we explain the underrepresentation of certain groups in GATE programs? Research clearly demonstrates that complex outcomes such as academic achievement are determined by multiple factors, including socioeconomic status, teacher qualifications and effectiveness, and academic engagement inside and outside of the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282911428197">Brody, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734282911428197">Ceci &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734282911428197">Neisser et al., 1996</xref>), and there is a considerable amount of information about these variables across racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>For example, the percentages of fourth graders—and by extension all students—eligible for free and reduced-price lunch are substantially higher for African Americans (74%), American Indians (68%), and Hispanic Americans (77%) than for Asian Americans (34%) and European Americans (29%), and these data reflect the differences in child poverty in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911428197">Aud, Fox, &amp; KewalRamani, 2010</xref>). Asian Americans have the lowest number of absences in school and spend more hours on homework than other groups, resulting in more time engaged with academic materials. More than 50% of African American and Hispanic American students who are employed work more than 20 hr per week, a variable related to lower academic performance. Higher percentages of African American and Hispanic American students are threatened or injured with weapons on school property than their Asian American and European American peers, and African Americans and Hispanic Americans are more likely to be taught by teachers with lower qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911428197">Aud et al., 2010</xref>). Given these data and their relationship to academic achievement, one can predict with a fair amount of certainty which groups of students are likely to have lower achievement scores, and the patterns that these data predict are the patterns that currently exist.</p>
<p>There are also other several theoretical models that explicitly link ethnic minority status to academic achievement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734282911428197">Ogbu and Simons (1998)</xref> contended that some minority groups (e.g., African Americans, American Indians) actively resist doing well in school, which they equate with historic oppression and current discrimination. As doing well in school is considered acting White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734282911428197">Ogbu, 2004</xref>), these researchers argue that substantial proportions of students choose to disengage from schooling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734282911428197">Ford, Grantham, and Whiting (2008)</xref> provided empirical support for this thesis; they reported that African American students in regular and gifted education associated acting White with being achievement oriented and acting Black with poor academic performance.</p>
<p>Others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911428197">McKown &amp; Weinstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0734282911428197">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>) have suggested that the negative societal views about African Americans’ intellectual capacity results in a stereotype threat that is activated in testing situations and results in poor performance on the part of this group. Some proponents of this position (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0734282911428197">Walton &amp; Spencer, 2009</xref>) argue that this psychological threat “causes measures of academic performance to underestimate the true intellectual ability and potential of ethnic minority students” (p. 1137). These theories suggest that many minority students may feel that they have to choose between (a) doing well in school (an academic identity) or (b) being <italic>an authentic</italic> member of their racial/ethnic group (a cultural identity).</p>
<p>Despite the failure to replicate the seminal research on teacher expectation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734282911428197">Rosenthal &amp; Jacobson, 1968</xref>), more recent research in this area (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734282911428197">McKown &amp; Weinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0734282911428197">Weinstein, 2002</xref>) suggests that teacher expectation effects may be more potent for students from ethnic minority backgrounds. In a comprehensive review of this literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734282911428197">Jussim and Harber (2005)</xref> concluded that although teacher expectation effects are small and typically accurate, these effects are larger (a) in classrooms where teachers engage in high differential treatment of students, (b) for low-achieving students from low-socioeconomic-status backgrounds, and (c) for African American students. Although the applicability of some of these theories in real-world settings remains contentious—for example, how much variance, if any, do stereotype threat and acting White account for in academic performance—these models suggest that at least some of the variance in the academic performance of ethnic minorities and the concomitant underrepresentation in GATE programs is not related to assessment practices but to individual psychological factors including choice and anxiety induced both by internal (e.g., stereotype threat) and external (e.g., teacher expectations) factors.</p>

<sec id="section9-0734282911428197">
<title>Alternative Assessment Tools</title>
<p>Several researchers have suggested alternative strategies for identifying gifted students to increase the representation of minority and low-SES students in these programs. Suggested alternatives include nonverbal measures of cognitive ability, performance tasks, multiple indices, and local norms. In support of the nonverbal test option, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734282911428197">Naglieri and Ford (2003)</xref> reported that minorities and European American samples had similar scores on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734282911428197">Naglieri, 1997</xref>), including at the upper end of the distribution which is used to identify students for GATE programs. However, given that the achievement gap is still with us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911428197">Aud et al., 2010</xref>), tests that predict academic performance should reflect this gap, and the absence of a gap raises predictive validity questions about NNAT scores. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734282911428197">Lohman (2005c)</xref> also suggested that the NNAT normative sample was not representative of the U.S. population and even less representative of the racial/ethnic subgroups. Moreover, as verbal reasoning is an important component of school performance, tests assessing only nonverbal reasoning are not the most useful for identifying students who will perform well on verbal reasoning tasks in regular education or gifted programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734282911428197">Lohman, 2005d</xref>).</p>
<p>Performance tasks—that is, tasks in which students are asked to solve functional problems, usually requiring multiple steps—are a useful addition to the gifted assessment repertoire. They are domain-specific and can help to identify the ability that will be enriched or accelerated in gifted programming. Moreover, they assess the fluency and complexity of responses, encourage the use of metacognition, require a dynamic assessment approach on behalf of the examiner and have been shown to be useful in identifying groups of ethnic minorities and low-income students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734282911428197">VanTassel-Baska, Johnson, &amp; Avery, 2002</xref>). However, there is little evidence that these tasks add incremental validity beyond commonly used IQ tests and indicators of previous achievement (e.g., GPA).</p>
<p>This is not to say we advocate <italic>against</italic> using alternative measures as part of a comprehensive identification plan. Indeed, one of the most effective ways of improving ethnic minority representation in GATE programs is to reduce the number of false negative errors by casting the widest selection net possible. Hypothetically, if districts were to eliminate the use of IQ tests for identifying gifted students, domain-specific achievement tests would be the best logical alternative because they are the best predictors of future performance in their domains.</p>
<p>The third alternative involves combining scores from multiple tests of intelligence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911428197">Lohman (2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734282911428197">2005b</xref>) provided a comprehensive rationale for this practice along with guidelines for combining scores from different tests. Lohman also made a compelling argument for crafting local norms for tests of intelligence and achievement. He argued that individual schools—and we would add especially schools in which gifted students are underrepresented—“rarely replicate the nation in their distribution of ability or achievement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734282911428197">Lohman, 2005b</xref>, p. 13). Thus, he suggested that students’ scores should be compared “only to the scores of other students who share similar learning opportunities and background characteristics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911428197">Lohman, 2005a</xref>, p. 349), and decisions about identification and acceleration for gifted placement be “made using local [i.e., school or district] norms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734282911428197">Lohman, 2005b</xref>, p. 14). Of course, the idea of using local norms is controversial and the decision about whether to use them may more appropriately rest with policy makers than assessment researchers. The role of the assessment researcher will be to determine if using local norms consistently increases the identification of minority students who are successful in gifted programs.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>How do we reconcile the information that we have reviewed? We have acknowledged that minority students are underrepresented in gifted and talented programs. However, we have also indicated that the underrepresentation is not an indication of bias, as the measures that are traditionally used are reliable and valid indicators of academic performance. We have highlighted some of the alternative measures and strategies that have been put forward to address the issue of underrepresentation. In the next section, we illustrate our own selection process to demonstrate how a variety of identification tools can be combined.</p>

<title>Minority Students in a Gifted Program</title>
<p>As noted above, the points of view with regard to minority underrepresentation may best be reconciled by educational policy rather than assessment practice. Although it is important to acknowledge that there will be underrepresentation of minority students in GATE programs until the achievement gap goes away, at the same time, we must also recognize that equitable representation in these programs is a worthy goal that we need to work toward, reflected in the following policy recommendation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911428197">Lohman (2005a)</xref>: “Because the discrepancy between potential and accomplishment will be greatest for those who have had the fewest opportunities, consider weighting accomplishment more heavily for advantaged students and potential for students whose educational opportunities have been more limited” (p. 354). In this section, we highlight one attempt to operationalize Lohman’s recommendation and show that neither is the process easy nor does it result in equal outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section12-0734282911428197">
<title>Identification</title>
<p>Many university-based summer programs for academically talented students based on the talent search model use the SAT as one admissions criterion. Although these programs use multiple criteria, the SAT is heavily weighted in the admissions decision, and in some cases, students must obtain a certain cut score to be admitted. As students get older, the cut score increases. In the summer program that we are affiliated with, the Academic Talent Development Program (ATDP), the SAT was eliminated as a criterion more than 15 years ago and replaced with a comprehensive review that is similar in some ways to the process that University of California (UC) Berkeley uses to admit undergraduate students. It is worth noting that more than 30% of UC Berkeley undergraduates are from low-income backgrounds.</p>
<p>The comprehensive review includes three measures of student achievement—report cards, state standardized tests (if available), and a work product completed within the past year that the student is particularly proud of. Students can substitute an essay for the work product based on a prompt we provide. Other data include an interest inventory and a recommendation from a teacher. Students who are applying for mathematics classes must get their letter of recommendation from their mathematics teacher, and students applying for accelerated courses are also required to take a readiness test, which allows the program to assess if the student has mastered the material in the previous course in the sequence and has a high probability of successfully completing a full year’s work in the 6-week program. The program also has information on the schools the students attend, which provides an index of academic quality and parents provide an estimate of income, with greater detail required from those who are applying for financial aid. The program uses all of this information to choose a cohort of students who are (a) at the top end of the distributions for their groups <italic>and</italic> (b) have the potential to be successful in the program. Students with mixed profiles may be contacted for supplemental information.</p>

<sec id="section13-0734282911428197">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants consisted of 82% (<italic>N</italic> = 877) of the students who attended ATDP in the summer of 2009. They ranged in age from 10 to 19 (<italic>M</italic> = 13.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.37) and 51.2% were female. The participants were from seven racial/ethnic groups that had more than 40 students. Three groups are typically underrepresented in programs of this type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911428197">Ford, 1998</xref>): African American (5.1%), Mexican Americans/Chicanos (6.4%), and other Hispanics/Latinos (6.3%). Three groups are among those labeled as <italic>model</italic> minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734282911428197">Kitano &amp; DiJiosia, 2002</xref>): Chinese Americans (57.1%), Indian Americans (6.8%), and Korean Americans (7.4%). The seventh group consisted of European Americans (10.8%). As these numbers indicate, the patterns of over- and underrepresentation are in keeping with the literature: all of the Asian American groups are overrepresented, and the other groups are underrepresented, including European Americans in this instance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0734282911428197">
<title>Data</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734282911428197">Figure 1</xref> consists of a summary of student academic and socioeconomic profiles. The top two graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734282911428197">Figure 1</xref> are based on the California Standards Tests. The left graph has standard score means—the scores range from 150 to 600—and the graph on the right has proficiency means, which range from 1 (<italic>far below basic</italic>) to 5 (<italic>advanced</italic>). As is evident, the scores for the African American, Chicano, and Hispanic/Latino groups are lower on average than the scores for the other groups. Indeed, the Asian and European American students’ mean falls between proficient and advanced, as does the English/language arts mean for the African Americans, and the mean mathematics scores for African Americans was at the advanced level. All the other means fall between basic and proficient. Not surprisingly, Chicano and Hispanic/Latino students have substantially lower English/language arts scores than mathematics scores, and substantially lower English/language arts scores than all other groups. The other academic input—the incoming grade point average—is presented in the left column in the bottom-right graph. The underrepresented students have mean GPAs around 3.5, whereas the GPAs of the other groups are in the 3.7-to-3.8 range.</p>

<p>The bottom-left graph contains markers of context and opportunity. The three bars in this graph indicate family income (1 = <italic>less than US$10,000</italic>, 5 = <italic>US$40,000 to US$60,000</italic>, 8 = <italic>over US$100,000</italic>) and mother and father’s education (1 = <italic>elementary school</italic>, 5 = <italic>some college</italic>, 7 = <italic>bachelor’s degree</italic>, 9 = <italic>graduate or professional degree</italic>), respectively. As can be seen, the differences here are similar to those in national data sets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911428197">Aud et al., 2010</xref>). The Hispanic groups have family incomes of less than US$40,000 on average, with both parents having, on average, high school diplomas. African Americans and Chinese Americans form a second tier, with incomes in the US$60,000 to US$80,000 bracket and education levels around the associate’s to bachelor’s degree, although the slightly higher levels and disproportionate size of the Chinese American group (half of the sample) suggests that this group is different from the African American cohort. The other groups report average incomes of more than US$80,000, and education levels in the graduate school range for both parents.</p>
<p>In the bottom-right graph, we also report the summer program GPA for the groups. With the exception of the Indian Americans, there is a drop between incoming GPA and summer program GPA, and this decrease is most pronounced for the three underrepresented groups. On one hand, the drop is not surprising, given that the program is more competitive than their home schools. However, there are probably other factors at work. Given the differences in income and education levels of parents, it is probable that the underrepresented students come from poorer districts, have families that are less able to assist with homework, and may even have to work more during the summer in addition to attending summer school (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911428197">Aud et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These data show that even in gifted identification based on multiple academic indicators and without the use of strict cut scores, there are differences in the academic profiles of the students from different racial/ethnic groups that reflect the differences evident in the achievement gap. The differences in socioeconomic status (i.e., parental education and income) among the groups were even starker than the differences in academic attainment.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section15-0734282911428197">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These data tell us several things. First, the achievement gap continues to play an important role in whether students qualify for GATE programs, whether one looks at standardized achievement test scores, GPAs, or variables related to socioeconomic status such as parental education and income levels. Despite making concerted efforts to recruit students from underrepresented populations, the data show that they continue to be underrepresented and that on average, their achievement is lower across multiple indicators. Moreover, if we were not using the comprehensive review in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911428197">Lohman’s (2005a)</xref> suggestion, and instead using strict cut scores on the measures of potential and accomplishment regardless of context, the scores of the underrepresented group members who would be in the program might be higher, but there would be even starker disproportionality than the one that currently exists.</p>
<p>Although assessment instruments are convenient targets to vilify, there is no compelling evidence suggesting that they play a major role in underrepresentation in GATE programs. Thus, blaming tests for underrepresentation is neither useful nor accurate and distracts us from focusing on the underlying cause, the achievement gap. The reasons for this gap are complex and not fully understood. We do, however, concur with GATE educators and measurement experts who suggest that GATE identification should use multiple indicators of talent. In the context of gifted identification, it is far more harmful to produce false negatives than false positives. This attitude is reflected in best-practice guidelines for identification as well. In 2008, the NAGC adopted a policy asserting that (a) no single measure should be used to make identification or placement decisions, (b) testing situations should not hinder students’ performance, and (c) multiple measures and different types of indicators from multiple sources be used to assess and serve gifted students. Equity, defined as proportional representation in gifted education by racial/ethnic group, is a noble <italic>aspiration</italic> for the field. However, it will not be fully achieved until the achievement gap itself is eliminated, an outcome that will only be evident in valid assessment data.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Recent changes in diabetes treatment guidelines and the introduction of new, more expensive pharmaceuticals appear to increase the financial challenges for nonelderly adults with diabetes. The authors used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to examine changes in the prevalence of diabetes and comorbidities, diabetes treatment, financial burdens, and the relationship between high financial burdens and patient characteristics. From 1997-1998 to 2006-2007, the total number of nonelderly adults treated for diabetes nearly doubled, from 5.4 to 10.7 million, and the proportion of diabetes patients using multiple drugs to treat their condition increased significantly. About a fifth of diabetes patients spent 10% or more of their family income on health care, and about one in nine spent 20% or more of their family income on health care. In 2006-2007, diabetes patients who were older, female, in poor health, or lacked insurance were more likely than others to have high burdens.</p>

<p>The treated prevalence of diabetes and associated comorbidities grew substantially in the decade from 1997 to 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712442570">Sarpong &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>). At the same time, recommended pharmaceutical treatment of diabetes evolved in complexity as a result of controlled clinical trials in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712442570">Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712442570">U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study Group, 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712442570">1998b</xref>). Diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients rely on insulin to help them reach the recommended treatment goal of a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of &lt;7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712442570">American Diabetes Association, 2009</xref>). For persons diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a stepwise treatment approach is recommended; initially with metformin plus lifestyle modifications and subsequently with the addition of other oral drugs such as sulfonylureas, and then with insulin or noninsulin injectables if the goal of a near-normal glycemic level is not achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712442570">Nathan et al., 2009</xref>). The recommended treatment guidelines have also been accompanied by the introduction of newer and more expensive antidiabetic drugs such as incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712442570">Alexander, Sehgal, Maloney, &amp; Stafford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712442570">Nichols, Alexander, Girman, Kamal-Bahl, &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>), long-acting insulins, ultrashort-acting insulins, and combinations of these classes of medications.</p>
<p>These recent developments in diabetes care raise concern that utilization of diabetes-related prescription drugs from multiple therapeutic classes and associated expenditures will add to the financial pressures faced by nonelderly persons with diabetes. Indeed, a recent study found that in 2001, between 63% and 70% of out-of-pocket expenditures by nonelderly persons with diabetes was due to prescribed drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712442570">Bernard, Banthin, &amp; Encinosa, 2006</xref>). To help inform targeted and appropriate health policy interventions for persons with diabetes, it is especially important to understand recent changes in diabetes care and how it contributes to health care financial burdens.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077558712442570">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>Previous studies have examined antidiabetic drug use and expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712442570">Alexander et al., 2008</xref>) and family financial burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712442570">Banthin &amp; Bernard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712442570">Bernard et al., 2006</xref>) but have not examined the effects of recent developments in diabetes treatment on the ability of nonelderly adults with diabetes to afford necessary health care. Our study helps bridge this gap by using nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the period 1997-1998 through 2006-2007, to examine whether evolving treatment guidelines and the introduction of newer antidiabetic drugs have put diabetes patients and their families at greater risk of having high health care financial burdens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077558712442570">
<title>Analytical Framework</title>
<p>Diabetes disproportionately affects the vulnerable in society, who often have comorbidities that require treatment with multiple nondiabetes drugs and who, on average, have lower incomes. We posit that recent changes in treatment guidelines toward the use of multiple antidiabetic therapeutic classes and the introduction of newer and more expensive antidiabetic drugs will, ceteris paribus, adversely affect family level out-of-pocket expenditures relative to family income for nonelderly adults with diabetes. Changes in a number of other factors, however, may mitigate these anticipated effects. The rising treated prevalence of diabetes may reflect changes in demographics, increases in disease awareness, increased screening and diagnosis, or changes in treatment options. Furthermore, changes in economic circumstances, such as rising income or falling prices for some antidiabetic drugs as generic versions become available, may mitigate the effects of increased drug use on burdens. We examined these issues in several steps.</p>
<p>First, we examined changes in the treated prevalence of diabetes and comorbidities among nonelderly adults with diabetes. We focused on nonelderly adults, who may be covered by private insurance or public programs or may be uninsured. We excluded the elderly from our analysis because they are almost universally covered by Medicare and, since 2006, have had access to a new form of drug coverage through Medicare Part D. For these reasons the analysis of changes in health care financial burdens are different for the elderly than for nonelderly adults. We also excluded diabetes patients younger than 18 years of age from our analysis since most patients within this age group are likely to be type 1 diabetes patients. We chose 1997-1998 as our beginning period because new drugs within therapeutic classes (e.g., thiazolidinediones) were introduced from 1997 onward and diabetes guidelines were first revised in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712442570">Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we examined changes in the use of drugs from multiple antidiabetic therapeutic classes by burden thresholds. Third, we followed previous studies of financial burdens by decomposing family-level out-of-pocket expenditures into components due to drug and nondrug spending and by assessing the ratio of out-of-pocket expenditures to overall family income. Finally, we used logit models to examine the association between high health care financial burdens and diabetes treatment controlling for a rich array of sociodemographic, economic, health, and geographic characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077558712442570" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>We use pooled, cross-sectional data from the MEPS for two time periods: 1997-1998 and 2006-2007. The MEPS is an ongoing overlapping panel survey sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that collects detailed and nationally representative information on health care utilization and expenditures, insurance coverage, sources of payment, health status, and demographic variables for the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712442570">Cohen, 1997</xref>). Pooling two years of annual MEPS data increases our sample sizes and allows us to present reliable estimates of the relationship between family financial burdens and patient characteristics including categories of pharmaceutical treatment for diabetes.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077558712442570">
<title>Measure of Family Financial Burden</title>
<p>Our measure of family financial burden is defined as the ratio of total family-level out-of-pocket expenditures on health care services to total family income in a given year. We measured both income and financial burden for health care at the family level, defining families as persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption who would typically be eligible for coverage under the same private family policy. Since families typically share financial resources, focusing on individual financial burdens related to diabetes, without incorporating those from nondiabetes out-of-pocket health expenditures, may not reflect the true financial strain facing these families. Thus, our burden measure includes both diabetes and nondiabetes health expenditures by all family members. However, we report population estimates at the person level, assigning each individual their family-level financial burden. This approach to measuring burdens captures individuals’ ability to pay for health care and has been used previously in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712442570">Banthin &amp; Bernard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712442570">Banthin, Cunningham, &amp; Bernard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712442570">Cunningham, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077558712442570">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before calculating family financial burdens, we adjusted for general price inflation by inflating income and out-of-pocket expenditures for 1997-1998 and 2006-2007 to 2007 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Areas (CPI-U). Following the previous literature, we categorized family financial burdens using both 10% and 20% thresholds. That is, in alternative scenarios, individuals were considered to have high burdens if their total family out-of-pocket spending on medical care was equal to or exceeded either 10% or 20% of family-level income. Using burden thresholds rather than raw percentages provides a straightforward approach to dealing with skewed data and mitigates the effects of misreported data (especially underreporting of income). This approach also allows us to present results in an intuitive fashion as the percentage of individuals with family out-of-pocket spending above a given threshold.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077558712442570">
<title>Diabetes and Other Medical Conditions</title>
<p>We used the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 3-digit codes to construct an indicator variable for diabetes mellitus (249, 250), cardiovascular disease (412, 413, 414, 427, and 428), hypertension (401), and disorders of lipoid metabolism (primarily hyperlipidemia, 272). Our interest lies in the treated prevalence of these conditions; thus, we identified nonelderly adults with diabetes and comorbidities within our sample by tying their diagnosis to any reported health services utilization such as home health, inpatient hospital stays, outpatient, office-based, emergency room visits, and prescribed medicines during the year. The three comorbidities were chosen both because they are important comorbidities for diabetes patients and because a recent study indicates that the treated prevalence of these comorbidities increased significantly among diabetes patients between 1997 and 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712442570">Sarpong &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077558712442570">
<title>Pharmaceutical Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus</title>
<p>We used the MEPS Prescribed Medicines (PMED) files to assess drug utilization and expenditures and assigned prescription drug purchases reported by respondents to the three major therapeutic classes of antidiabetic drugs (orals, insulin, and noninsulin injectables) by linking the PMED file to the Multum Lexicon database, a product of Cerner Multum, Inc. At the time of our study, 6 classes of oral antidiabetics, more than 20 types of insulin, and 2 types of noninsulin injectables were approved for the treatment of diabetes in the United States. Due to an inadequate sample of diabetes patients who used noninsulin injectables, we combined noninsulin injectables with insulin. To assess the extent to which nonelderly adult diabetes patients used drugs from multiple therapeutic classes to treat their disease, we created a summary variable with five mutually exclusive “treatment types” as follows: no drug treatment, one oral, two or more orals, injectables only, and injectables and orals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077558712442570">
<title>Other Variables</title>
<p>We classified age (18-44, 45-54, and 55-64 years) based on the last available age for the sampled MEPS respondent. Racial-ethnic categories in our models include White-Other, Black, and Hispanic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077558712442570">2</xref></sup> Health insurance status was based on household responses to MEPS health insurance status questions. Individuals with insurance coverage for hospital and physician care (including Armed Forces–related coverage but excluding public coverage) at any time during the year were classified as having private insurance. Individuals not covered by private insurance who were covered by any public programs at any point during the year were classified as having public insurance only. Those lacking private and public insurance coverage for the entire year, or for their period of eligibility for the survey, were classified as uninsured.</p>
<p>Family size was based on responses to MEPS family size questions. Respondents were classified into three categories as follows: “one-person,” “two-person,” and “three or more-person” family. Perceived health status was classified based on responses to the MEPS self-rated physical health status questions as follows: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. We collapsed the first three (“excellent,” “very good,” and “good”) and the last two (“fair” and “poor”) response categories to create a binary physical health status variable. Census regions were classified for each MEPS sampled person based on the U.S. Census Bureau definition of the regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, or West.</p>
<p>Poverty categories were derived by (a) summing person-level income totals over family members as defined by the Current Population Survey and then (b) dividing family income by the applicable federal poverty level (FPL), which is adjusted for family size and composition. The resulting percentages were then grouped into two categories: poor-low income (&lt;200% FPL) and middle-high income (≥200% FPL).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712442570">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>The MEPS uses complex sampling methods and our estimates account for the stratification, clustering, and weights to ensure that our results are nationally representative of persons in the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population who were between the ages of 18 and 64 years and who were treated for diabetes during the year. We used pooled data for 1997-1998 and 2006-2007 and report average annual estimates for these two time periods. Taylor series approximation techniques were used to estimate standard errors for descriptive statistics. Our sample of nonelderly adults with diabetes comprises 1,291 persons (ages 18-44 = 302; ages 45-54 = 456; and ages 55-64 = 533) in 1997-1998 and 2,420 persons (ages 18-44 = 523; ages 45-54 = 787; and ages 55-64 = 1,110) in 2006-2007.</p>
<p>We estimated separate logit models for our two time periods, 1997-1998 and 2006-2007, to examine associations between high burdens and categories of pharmaceutical treatment for diabetes controlling for an array of key demographic, economic, health, and geographic characteristics. In our discussion of results, we focus on the more recent period, but we also compare estimated marginal effects for the two time periods to assess whether the determinants of burdens changed during the period of our study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077558712442570">3</xref></sup> Unlike some previous studies on financial burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712442570">Galbraith, Wong, Kim, &amp; Newacheck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712442570">Parish, Shattuck, &amp; Rose, 2009</xref>), we excluded income as a right-hand side variable because this information is already captured in the denominator of our dependent variable (high burden). To test the robustness of our logit models with respect to income, we estimate separate models for diabetes patients in poor-low income and middle-high income families. The results from all models are presented as average marginal effects, which reflect discrete first-differences from the reference category in the probability of high burdens, holding all other covariates constant.</p>

<title>Changes in the Treated Prevalence of Diabetes, Comorbidities, and Diabetes Treatment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712442570">Table 1</xref> presents information on the treated prevalence of diabetes and comorbidities among nonelderly adults. The total number of nonelderly adults treated for diabetes in the United States nearly doubled between 1997-1998 (5.4 million) and 2006-2007 (10.7 million). This represents an increase of 2.4 percentage points in the proportion of nonelderly adults who reported treatment for diabetes from 3.3% of the total U.S. population in 1997-1998 to 5.7% in 2006-2007. The prevalence of comorbidities also grew significantly over the period of our study. The treated prevalence of hypertension among nonelderly adults with diabetes increased from 41.0% in 1997-1998 to 56.8% in 2006-2007, an increase of almost 40%. Over the same period, the proportion reporting disorders of lipoid metabolism more than tripled from 14.8% to 45.0%.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712442570">Table 1</xref> also presents information on changes in the pharmaceutical treatment of diabetes. Results show a general trend toward increasing use of multiple therapeutic classes of drugs. In particular, the proportion (total number) of nonelderly adults with diabetes who used two or more oral antidiabetic drugs rose from 15.7% (0.85 million) in 1997-1998 to 30.1% (3.2 million) in 2006-2007. Similarly, the proportion (total number) of nonelderly adults with diabetes who used both injectables and oral antidiabetic drugs rose from 12.7% (0.69 million) in 1997-1998 to 16.0% (1.7 million) in 2006-2007. In contrast, the proportion using injectables alone to treat their condition declined from 25.2% to 12.5% during the period. There were no statistically significant changes in the proportion of adults who used one oral antidiabetic medication or who did not use any drugs to treat their diabetes.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found that the average number of drugs prescribed for nonelderly adults with diabetes to treat all conditions increased from 6.2 in 1997-1998 to 7.3 unique drugs in 2006-2007, and the average number of prescribed diabetes drugs increased from 1.5 to 1.8 unique drugs during the period (data available on request). As one would expect, given the rapid increase in the treated prevalence of comorbidities, the proportion of nonelderly adults with diabetes who used antihypertensive drugs increased from 35.9% to 50.1%, whereas the proportion who used antihyperlipidemic drugs increased from 12.0% to 42.2% during the period (data available on request).</p>

<title>Changes in Income, Out-of-Pocket Expenditures, and Family Financial Burdens</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712442570">Table 2</xref> presents information on family-level incomes and out-of-pocket health care expenditures by burden category. We found that the average total, inflation-adjusted family income (column 3) across all nonelderly adults with diabetes increased from $47,603 to $52,029 during the period, whereas average total family out-of-pocket expenditures (column 4) increased by nearly 40% from $1,663 in 1997-1998 to $2,310 in 2006-2007. The amount paid out-of-pocket for health care increased from $3,380 to $4,807 for those with burdens above the 10% threshold, whereas their average incomes increased from $12,932 to $20,690. Similarly, out-of-pocket spending increased from $3,741 to $5,339 and average incomes increased from $6,751 to $10,915 for those with burdens above the 20% threshold. Individuals with burdens below the 10% and 20% thresholds had both lower out-of-pocket spending and higher incomes than individuals with high burdens.</p>

<p>Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712442570">Table 2</xref> also show that there was no statistically significant change, from 1997-1998 to 2006-2007, in the proportion of adults with high burdens. Approximately one fifth (19.9% to 21.1%) of diabetes patients spent 10% or more of their family income on health care, and about one in nine (10.9% to 12.0%) spent 20% or more of their family income on health care in both periods. The large increase in the treated prevalence of diabetes, however, resulted in substantial increases in the total number of adults with high burdens. In particular, the total number of adults with burdens above the 10% threshold more than doubled, from 1.1 million to 2.3 million, and the total number with burdens above the 20% threshold increased from 0.7 to 1.2 million.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712442570">Table 3</xref> presents information on total, nondrug, drug (including diabetes and nondiabetes drug), and out-of-pocket expenditures as a percentage of family income by levels of family financial burdens. Overall, we found that between 1997-1998 and 2006-2007, the ratio of out-of-pocket expenditures to family income increased from 3.5% to 4.4%. During the same period the ratio of out-of-pocket expenditures on all prescribed drugs to family income increased from 1.7% to 2.5%. Correspondingly, spending on diabetes drugs increased from 0.4% to 0.6% and spending on nondiabetes drugs increased from 1.3% to 1.9% of family income. Among nonelderly adults with diabetes, those with high burdens (above 10% threshold) devoted 13.2% of their income to all prescribed drugs in 2006-2007, of which 2.6% and 10.6% of the income were devoted to diabetes and nondiabetes drugs, respectively. We also found that those with high burdens (above 10% threshold) were spending 10.0% of family income on nondrug (hospital stays, ambulatory care visits, and other health care services) expenses in 2006-2007. The corresponding percentages for those with very high burdens (above 20% threshold) were prescribed drugs (28.7), nondrug services (20.2), diabetes drugs (5.1), and nondiabetes drugs (23.6).</p>

<p>Results from our logit models for 2006-2007 indicate that, controlling for other factors, a number of demographic, economic, and health characteristics were associated with burdens defined at both the 10% and 20% thresholds. For both burden levels, in 2006-2007, adults with diabetes who were more likely than others to have high burdens included persons who were older than 44 years, female, in single person families (compared with those in families of three or more), or in poor health. Also for both burden levels, marginal effects were largest for insurance status. Public insurance coverage was associated with increases of 14.8 (10% threshold) and 14.0 (20% threshold) percentage points in the probability of having a high burden and being uninsured was associated with increases in high burdens of 27.4 (10% threshold) and 19.7 (20% threshold) percentage points. The effects of diabetes treatment types were estimated relative to persons with no drug treatment. Results show that in 2006-2007, there were no statistically significant associations between any treatment type and the probability of having a high health care financial burden.</p>
<p>Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712442570">Table 4</xref> also provide evidence on whether there were significant changes in the determinants of high burdens during the period of our study. A comparison of the results for 2006-2007 and 1997-1998 reveals there were no statistically significant changes in marginal effects in the 10% burden models and only a few statistically significant changes in the 20% burden models. Changes in the effects of diabetes treatment types are of central interest for this study. Results show that, in the 20% burden model, the marginal effect of using injectables only fell from 8.3 to −0.7 percentage points and the marginal effect of using injectables and orals fell from 11.9 to 0.4 percentage points over the period of our study. Results for the 10% model were qualitatively similar, except that differences in marginal effects across time periods were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>To test the robustness of our results and to examine outcomes within low-income populations where policy interventions may be more necessary and effective, we estimated our 10% burden model separately for poor-low income persons and for middle-high income persons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077558712442570">Appendix</xref>). The results for diabetes treatment types were qualitatively similar to those presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712442570">Table 4</xref>, except that for the poor-low income population, the marginal effect of using injectables and orals (18.8 percentage points) remained statistically significant in 2006-2007. One consistent difference in the split sample models was that the magnitude of marginal effects was generally larger for the poor-low income population than for the middle-high income population, or for the full population, reflecting the higher level of burden among poor-low income persons. The exception was insurance status. In 2006-2007, the marginal effect of public insurance coverage for low-income persons was statistically insignificant, although being uninsured increased the probability of having a burden of 10%, or more, by 17.0 percentage points versus 27.4 percentage points in the full sample model. This suggests that the large marginal effects of public coverage and uninsurance in the full sample model were due, in part, to the correlation between income and insurance status.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study used nationally representative MEPS data to examine trends in the prevalence of diabetes and comorbidities, the use of antidiabetic medications, and family financial burdens among nonelderly adults with diabetes in the United States. Between 1997-1998 and 2006-2007, the treated prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and disorders of lipoid metabolism increased as well as the intensity of pharmaceutical treatment of diabetes, especially, the use of multiple oral drugs and the use of both oral and injectable drugs. Our findings on treated prevalence and use of antidiabetic drugs are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712442570">Alexander et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712442570">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712442570">Mann, Woodward, Ye, Krousel-Wood, &amp; Muntner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712442570">Sarpong &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712442570">Thorpe, 2005</xref>). Previous research has also documented the challenges diabetes patients face in affording necessary medical care, especially prescribed medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712442570">Bernard et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that persons treated for diabetes are at an increased risk of having high health care financial burdens.</p>
<p>Our descriptive and multivariate results, however, did not reveal any significant change in the overall level of burdens for this population as approximately one fifth of diabetes patients spent 10% or more of their family income on health care and about one in nine spent 20% or more of their family income on health care throughout the period of our study. The impact of antidiabetic drug use on high burdens actually declined. Our logit models for 2006-2007 show that none of our categories of diabetes drug treatment significantly increased the probability of high burdens, relative to no drug treatment. There are a number of possible explanations why the prevalence of high burdens remained relatively flat over the period. First, total family incomes increased over the period, which lessened the impact of increased out-of-pocket expenditures on family budgets. Second, prescription drugs for the treatment of diabetes alone may not be as important in driving high burdens compared with prescription drugs for the treatment of both diabetes and diabetes-related comorbidities. Finally, generic penetration of prescription drugs increased during the period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712442570">Rizzo &amp; Zeckhauser, 2009</xref>), which may have mitigated the effects of increased drug use on high burdens. In 2000, two classes of oral antidiabetic medications (i.e., sulfonylurea and metformin) lost market exclusivity—allowing lower priced generics to enter the market in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712442570">Kesselheim, Fischer, &amp; Avorn, 2006</xref>). Also, generic versions of a number of diabetes-related classes of drugs became available during this time period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077558712442570">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>One limitation of our study is that the MEPS data do not allow us to distinguish type 1 and type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077558712442570">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077558712442570">6</xref></sup> nor do we have sufficient clinical information to determine whether individuals are receiving treatment per current treatment guidelines. Nonetheless, unlike other data sources, the MEPS provide a sufficiently large nationally representative sample and a broad array of variables to assess the relationships in this study. We also used cross-sectional data, and consequently, causal relationships cannot be established from our results. Finally, our measure of family financial burdens excludes premiums<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077558712442570">7</xref></sup> in the numerator and taxes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077558712442570">8</xref></sup> in the denominator.</p>
<p>Although the proportion of diabetes patients with high burdens did not change, the total number with high burdens nearly doubled during the period of our study—driven in large part by an increase in the treated prevalence of diabetes and its comorbidities. Financial burdens to health care are associated with poorer health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712442570">Gibson, Ozminkowski, &amp; Goetzel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712442570">Heisler et al., 2004</xref>), including poorer adherence to medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712442570">Piette, Heisler, &amp; Wagner, 2004b</xref>). Our findings suggest, therefore, that for a rising number of persons, the financial strain of high health care burdens may result in inadequate treatment of diabetes and its complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712442570">Hill, Miller, &amp; Sing, 2011</xref>). Our findings may be especially important for policy makers targeting low-income and uninsured diabetes patients who are particularly at risk of having high burdens. Diabetes patients at risk of high burdens should be identified and informed about low-cost generics substitutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712442570">Piette, Heisler, &amp; Wagner, 2004a</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that increased use of generic substitutes may have lowered family financial burdens for most persons in the nonelderly, U.S. population between 2003 and 2007, but burdens remained stubbornly high among patients with public insurance and patients with low incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712442570">Gellad, Donohue, Zhao, Zhang, &amp; Banthin, 2012</xref>). Our findings also underscore the potential importance of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), which places income-based caps on out-of-pocket health care expenses for individuals and families who obtain insurance through newly established exchanges. Income-based caps on out-of-pocket health care expenses in the Affordable Care Act may help low-income and uninsured diabetes patients who are particularly at risk of having high burdens. Future research should examine the role of income-based caps and generic substitution on family financial burdens for patients with diabetes and comorbidities.</p>

<p>In contrast to an earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712442570">Banthin and Bernard (2006)</xref>, our burden measures do not incorporate insurance premiums in the numerator or taxes in the denominator.</p>

<p>Beginning in 2002, the data reflect whether the respondents wanted to identify with multiple races. The race/ethnicity characteristics for 2003 actually reflect Hispanic; non- Hispanic, White, no other race indicated; non-Hispanic, Black, no other race indicated; and non-Hispanic, other single races, and multiple races. Due to sample size limitations we combined “other” with “White” into “White-other”.</p>

<p>Based on information from the Centers for Disease Control, we expect that approximately 5% to 10% of our sample has type 1 diabetes. Combining type 1 and type 2 diabetes will not markedly affect our results, because type 1 is a small part of our sample and there is no evidence to suggest that there was growth in the proportion with type 1 diabetes over the period. Moreover, the cost drivers of type 1 diabetes are largely dialysis and indirect costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712442570">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>), which are not captured in our data.</p>

<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712442570">Cunningham (2010)</xref> suggests that point estimates of family-level financial burden using pretax incomes are only slightly higher and trends over time are virtually identical.</p>

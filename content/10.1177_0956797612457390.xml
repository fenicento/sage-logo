      <abstract>
        <p>The stop-signal paradigm is a popular method for examining response inhibition and
          impulse control in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical domains because it
          allows the estimation of the covert latency of the stop process: the stop-signal reaction
          time (SSRT). In three sets of simulations, we examined to what extent SSRTs that were
          estimated with the popular mean and integration methods were influenced by the skew of the
          reaction time distribution and the gradual slowing of the response latencies. We found
          that the mean method consistently overestimated SSRT. The integration method tended to
          underestimate SSRT when response latencies gradually increased. This underestimation bias
          was absent when SSRTs were estimated with the integration method for smaller blocks of
          trials. Thus, skewing and response slowing can lead to spurious inhibitory differences. We
          recommend that the mean method of estimating SSRT be abandoned in favor of the integration
          method.</p>

    <p>The ability to inhibit planned or ongoing actions is a cornerstone of flexible human behavior
        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612457390">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2008</xref>).
      The stop-signal paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612457390">Fig. 1a</xref>) is
      currently one of the most popular tasks for examining response inhibition in the laboratory.
      The last decade has witnessed an exponential rise in stop-signal studies in various research
      domains (see Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material available online). The paradigm is popular
      because it allows researchers to estimate the covert latency of the stop process: the
        <italic>stop-signal reaction time</italic> (SSRT). SSRT has been used to explore the
      cognitive and neural mechanisms of response inhibition, the development and decline of
      inhibitory capacities across the life span, and correlations between individual differences in
      stopping and behaviors such as substance abuse, pathological gambling, risk taking, and more
      generally, control of impulses and urges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612457390">Chambers, Garavan, &amp; Bellgrove, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612457390">Logan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612457390">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2008</xref>).</p>

        <p>Experimental paradigm. In the stop-signal task (a), participants perform a go task (e.g.,
          responding to the shape of a go stimulus). On a minority of the trials, the go stimulus is
          followed by a stop signal (e.g., the outline of the shape turning bold) after a variable
          stop-signal delay (SSD); this stop signal instructs the subject to withhold the planned
          response. FIX = presentation duration of the fixation sign; MAXRT = response deadline. A
          graphic representation of the assumptions of the independent-horse-race model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612457390">Logan and Cowan (1984</xref>; b) indicates
          how the probability of responding, <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal), depends on the
          distribution of go reaction time, SSD, and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). In this
          example, <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) = .50. The dashed line corresponds to the
            <italic>n</italic>th percentile, with <italic>n</italic> equal to
          <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) multiplied by 100. When the distribution is skewed to
          the right, as in (c), there is a substantial difference between the mean and the
            <italic>n</italic>th RT; this may influence the SSRT estimations.</p>

    <p>In the present study, we used simulations to test the reliability and accuracy of SSRT
      estimates. Previous simulations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612457390">Band,
        van der Molen, and Logan (2003)</xref> showed that commonly used SSRT-estimation methods
      were not influenced much by variability in go reaction time (RT) or in SSRT, or by dependency
      between the go and stop processes. However, we will show that estimates are strongly biased by
      positive skew and by gradual slowing of RTs. Because skew and slowing are important
      characteristics of RT distributions in most stop- signal experiments, our simulations suggest
      that some of the previously reported differences in stopping may be spurious.</p>
    <p>SSRT is estimated according to the independent-race model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612457390">Logan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612457390">Logan &amp; Cowan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612457390">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>): Performance in the stop
      task can be modeled as a race between a go process, which is triggered by the presentation of
      the go stimulus, and a stop process, which is triggered by the presentation of a stop signal
        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612457390">Fig. 1b</xref>). The stop signal occurs
      after a variable interval, the stop-signal delay (SSD). If the go process finishes before the
      stop process (i.e., when RT &lt; (SSRT + SSD)), then response inhibition is unsuccessful and a
      response is executed; if the stop process finishes before the go process (i.e., when RT &gt;
      (SSRT + SSD)), then the response is correctly withheld. The race model provides two common
      methods for estimating SSRT: the <italic>integration</italic> method and the
        <italic>mean</italic> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612457390">Logan
        &amp; Cowan, 1984</xref>). In the integration method, the point at which the stop process
      finishes is estimated by integrating the RT distribution and finding the point at which the
      integral equals the probability of responding, <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal), for a
      specific delay. SSRT is then calculated by subtracting SSD from the finishing time. In the
      mean method, the mean of the inhibition function (a plot of the probability of responding
      given a stop signal against SSD; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612457390">Logan
        &amp; Cowan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612457390">Verbruggen
        &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>) is subtracted from the mean of the RT distribution.</p>
    <p>In recent years, the majority of stop-signal studies have used a dynamic tracking procedure
      to determine an SSD at which subjects inhibit their responses 50% of the time. At the
      beginning of the experiment, SSD is set to a specific value (e.g., 250 ms) and is then
      constantly adjusted after stop-signal trials depending on the outcome of the race: When
      inhibition is successful, SSD increases (e.g., by 50 ms); when inhibition is unsuccessful, SSD
      decreases (e.g., by 50 ms). This one-up/ one-down tracking procedure typically results in a
        <italic>p</italic>(respond| signal) of approximately .50, which means that the race between
      the stop process and the go process is tied. Then SSRT is usually estimated with the mean
      method or the integration method (see Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612457390">1</xref></sup> The mean method uses the mean of
      the inhibition function, which corresponds to the average SSD obtained with the tracking
      procedure when <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) = .50. In other words, the mean method
      assumes that the mean RT equals SSRT plus the mean SSD, so SSRT can be estimated easily by
      subtracting the mean SSD from the mean RT (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612457390">Logan &amp; Cowan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457390">Logan, Schachar, &amp; Tannock, 1997</xref>). The integration
      method assumes that the finishing time of the stop process corresponds to the
        <italic>n</italic>th RT, with <italic>n</italic> equal to the number of RTs in the RT
      distribution multiplied by the overall <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612457390">Logan, 1981</xref>); SSRT can then be
      estimated by subtracting the mean SSD from the <italic>n</italic>th RT (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612457390">Ridderinkhof, Band, &amp; Logan, 1999</xref>;
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612457390">Verbruggen, Liefooghe, &amp;
        Vandierendonck, 2004</xref>).</p>
    <p>Simulations and reliability tests<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797612457390">2</xref></sup> suggest that when the tracking procedure is used, the mean and integration
      estimates are both reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612457390">Band et al.,
        2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612457390">Congdon et al., 2012</xref>;
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457390">Logan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612457390">Williams, Ponesse, Schachar, Logan, &amp;
        Tannock, 1999</xref>). However, a recent empirical study reported numerical differences
      between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612457390">Boehler, Appelbaum, Krebs,
        Hopf, &amp; Woldorff, 2012</xref>). We propose that such discrepancies are mainly due to two
      factors, namely, the skewness of the RT distribution and the degree of proactive response
      slowing in anticipation of stop signals. Indeed, the simulations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612457390">Band et al. (2003)</xref>, and the comparison of the mean and
      integration methods by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612457390">Boehler et al.
        (2012)</xref>, suggest that skew and slowing might have an effect on estimations. However,
      these factors have not been systematically explored in the simulations or reliability tests so
      far. There are often large individual or group differences in the shape of the RT distribution
      and the degree of response slowing, so it is important to know the extent to which these
      differences influence SSRT estimates.</p>
    <p>In our first set of simulations, we examined the effect of positively skewed RT distributions
      on SSRT estimates. It is well known that the mean is strongly influenced by extreme scores in
      the tails of the distribution; the median is less affected by the tails. In the stop-signal
      task, the median corresponds to the <italic>n</italic>th RT when
      <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) is exactly .50. Because RT distributions are usually
      positively skewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612457390">Ratcliff, 1993</xref>),
      the right tail of the distribution might explain discrepancies between the mean and
      integration estimates. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612457390">Figure 1c</xref>
      shows, the mean method would overestimate the finishing time of the stop process (and,
      therefore, the SSRT) when the RT distribution is skewed, whereas the integration method might
      provide a more accurate estimate. We tested this in the first set of simulations.</p>
    <p>In a second and third set of simulations, we explored the effect of response slowing on SSRT
      estimates. Recent studies have shown that subjects slow responses either proactively when they
      expect that stop signals might occur or reactively when they fail to inhibit their responses
      (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612457390">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612457390">Bissett &amp; Logan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612457390">Leotti &amp; Wager, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612457390">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612457390">Verbruggen, Logan, Liefooghe, &amp;
        Vandierendonck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612457390">Zandbelt,
        Bloemendaal, Neggers, Kahn, &amp; Vink, 2012</xref>). Indeed, subjects sometimes slow their
      RTs over the course of the experiment to try to beat the tracking algorithm (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612457390">Leotti &amp; Wager, 2010</xref>, for some
      extreme examples). These shifts in the RT distribution could result in overestimates of SSRT
      in the mean method because slowing would primarily influence the right tail of the
      distribution; however, in the integration method, these shifts could result in underestimates
      in SSRT because the tracking is a step behind when subjects continuously slow down. We tested
      the effect of slowing in the second and third sets of simulations.</p>

        <p>In this study, performance in the stop-signal task was simulated according to the

            Cowan, 1984</xref>): On stop-signal trials, a response was deemed to be withheld
            (<italic>signal-inhibit trial</italic>) when the RT was larger than the sum of the SSRT
          and the SSD; a response was deemed to be erroneously executed (<italic>signal-respond
            trial</italic>) when RT was smaller than the sum of the SSRT and SSD.</p>
        <p>All simulations were done using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612457390">R
            Development Core Team, 2008</xref>). RTs were sampled from an ex-Gaussian distribution
          using the rexGaus function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gamlss.org" xlink:type="simple">http://gamlss.org</ext-link>). The ex-Gaussian distribution is often used by
          psychologists to describe RT data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612457390">Ratcliff &amp; Murdock, 1976</xref>); it has a positively skewed unimodal shape and
          results from a convolution of a normal (Gaussian) distribution and an exponential
          distribution. It is characterized by three parameters: µ (mean of the Gaussian component),
          σ (standard deviation of the Gaussian component), and τ (both the mean and the standard
          deviation of the exponential component; Fig. S2 in the Supplemental Material shows how
          changes in these three parameters influence the distribution). Sigma approximately
          represents the rise in the left tail of the ex-Gaussian distribution, and τ approximately
          represents the fall in the right tail of the ex-Gaussian distribution, whose mean is equal
          to the sum of µ plus τ and whose variance is equal to the sum of τ<sup>2</sup> plus

          often increased in clinical populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612457390">Klein, Wendling, Huettner, Ruder, &amp; Peper, 2006</xref>;
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612457390">Leth-Steensen, King Elbaz, &amp;
            Douglas, 2000</xref>). For each combination of RT σ and RT τ, we simulated the data of
          100 subjects. Mu was different for each subject, µ(subject); it was sampled from a normal
          distribution with a mean of 400 (i.e., the population mean; <italic>SD</italic> = 25),
          with the restriction that it was larger than 300.</p>
        <p>SSRTs were also sampled from an ex-Gaussian distribution. For all subjects, both SSRT σ
          and SSRT τ were 10. Mu(subject) was derived from a normal distribution with a mean of 200
          (population mean; <italic>SD</italic> = 10), with the restriction that µ(subject) was
          larger than 150. Note that we also ran simulations in which SSRT σ and SSRT τ were varied;
          the results are reported in the Supplemental Material (Table S7). SSRT σ and SSRT τ did
          not influence the estimates much and did not interact with the effects of RT τ and
          response slowing. Therefore, we used only one value for SSRT σ and SSRT τ in the main
          simulations reported here.</p>
        <p>For each simulated subject, there were four blocks of 60 trials; signals randomly
          occurred on 25% of the trials, which resulted in 15 stop-signal trials per block. The
          delay between the start of the go process and the start of the stop process (SSD) was
          initially set at 150 plus RT τ (e.g., when RT τ was 250, the initial SSD was 400) and
          subsequently adjusted: After a signal-inhibit trial, SSD increased by 50; after a
          signal-respond trial, SSD decreased by 50. The start value was chosen in such a way that
          the race between go and stop would be close, but with a small initial head start for the
          stop process (the finishing time of the go process had a mean RT of 400 plus RT τ; the
          finishing time of the stop process was equal to SSD + mean SSRT = 150 + RT τ + 200 + SSRT
          τ). Because µ was not manipulated across conditions, we only used τ to determine start
          SSD.</p>
        <p>In the second set of simulations, we examined the effect of gradual slowing of RTs. RTs
          were again derived from an ex-Gaussian distribution, but RT µ increased linearly over
          trials. The start value of RT µ was again derived from a normal distribution with µ equal
          to 400 (<italic>SD</italic> = 25). The slope of the increase depended on a slowing factor,
          which could be 1, 1.5, or 2.5; these values were roughly based on the degree of slowing
          for individual subjects in one of our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612457390">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>). The slope of the
          increase was calculated as follows: (<italic>y</italic>2 −
            <italic>y</italic>1)/(<italic>x</italic>2 − <italic>x</italic>1), with
            <italic>y</italic>2 = RT µ(start) × slowing factor, and <italic>y</italic>1 = RT
          µ(start), <italic>x</italic>2 = 240 (the trial number of the last trial), and
            <italic>x</italic>1 = 1 (trial number of the first trial). When the slowing factor was
          1, the slope was 0 (i.e., <italic>y</italic>2 = <italic>y</italic>1, so no slowing). When
          the slowing factor was 1.5 or 2.5, the slope was positive, and RT µ increased. For
          example, with only six trials and the slowing factor equal to 1.5, RT µs would be µ(start)
          on the first trial, µ(start) × 1.1 on the second trial, µ(start) × 1.2 on the third trial,
          µ(start) × 1.3 on the fourth trial, µ(start) × 1.4 on the fifth trial, and µ(start) × 1.5
          on the sixth trial. In this second set of simulations, RT σ was 50 or 150, and RT τ was 50
          or 250.</p>
        <p>Finally, in the third set of simulations, the slowing factor was different for each
          subject to allow for individual differences in slowing. For each simulated subject, the
          slowing factor was derived from a uniform distribution with a minimum of 1 and a maximum
          of 3.</p>

        <title>Estimation and analyses</title>
        <p>For the first set of simulations, we estimated SSRT over all blocks using the mean method
          (SSRT = mean RT – mean SSD) and the integration method (SSRT = <italic>n</italic>th RT –
          mean SSD). For the second and third set, we also estimated SSRT for each block separately
          using the integration method and then took the average of these four block
              estimates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0956797612457390">3</xref></sup> Trials
          with an RT higher than 2,000 were considered to be missed responses (in real experiments,
          there is always a response deadline around this value). These missed trials were excluded
          when we estimated SSRT using the mean method; for the integration methods, RT for missed
          responses was set to 2,000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0956797612457390">4</xref></sup></p>
        <p>For each estimation method, we calculated the difference between the estimated SSRT and
          the actual SSRT; positive values indicated that SSRT was overestimated, whereas negative
          values indicated that SSRT was underestimated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612457390">Table 1</xref> reports the mean difference scores,

          (ANOVAs; see Tables S2, S4, and S6 in the Supplemental Material for overviews), we then

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>In the first set of simulations, the tracking procedure worked well and
        <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) was close to .50 for all RT σ and RT τ combinations (see
        Table S1 in the Supplemental Material). When we collapsed across all values of RT σ and RT
        τ, we found that the mean method overestimated SSRT; by contrast, the integration method
        tended to slightly underestimate SSRT.</p>
      <p>We used box plots of difference scores to examine the accuracy of SSRT estimates and to
        explore the estimation bias: a leftward shift of a box indicated underestimation; a
        rightward shift indicated overestimation. The plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612457390">Fig. 2</xref>) demonstrated that when RT σ and RT τ were
        small, the difference between the estimated and actual SSRTs was small for most subjects. An
        increase in RT σ led to more noisy estimates but did not induce a systematic bias (i.e., the
        box widened but was still centered around zero). Changes in RT τ, which influenced the right
        tail (positive skew) of the RT distribution, had a more pronounced effect on SSRT
        estimations. A comparison of the bottom- and top-row box plots shows that when RT τ
        increased, estimates became noisier and, more important, became biased. For the mean method,
        the rightward shift of the top-row boxes indicates that SSRT was overestimated when RT τ
        increased. The integration method had a small tendency to underestimate SSRT when RT τ
        increased, but this effect was less pronounced. Thus, the integration method seemed more
        robust and less biased than did the mean method. These conclusions are supported by
        significant main effects of estimation method and RT τ, and by an interaction between

      <p>The overestimation bias for large RT τs is problematic when SSRTs of different groups or
        conditions are compared. Often, RT distributions differ between groups or conditions. For
        example, a recent study showed that RT τ was approximately 251 ms for children with
        attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 162 ms for children without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612457390">Tiftein et al., 2011</xref>). Such RT τ group
        differences could influence the SSRT estimates. We further tested this by randomly selecting
        20 subjects in the condition in which RT σ was equal to 100 and RT τ was equal to150 and 20
        subjects in the condition in which RT σ was equal to 100 and RT τ was equal to 250. As
        expected, there was no difference between the true stop latencies in both conditions (208
        vs. 206, respectively), <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> = .750.
        However, there was a significant 31-ms difference between the estimated SSRTs (RT τ = 150:
        229 ms, RT τ = 250: 260 ms), <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 6.60, <italic>p</italic> = .014.
        Thus, when there are differences in RT τ, the mean method may lead to incorrect conclusions
        about group differences in SSRTs. Note that there was no difference between the SSRTs
        estimated using the integration method (RT τ = 150: 200 vs. RT τ = 250: 204),
          <italic>F</italic>(1, 38) = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = .798.</p>
      <p>In the second set of simulations, we tested how gradual slowing of RTs over trials
        influenced the SSRT estimates. Here, we used two variants of the integration method: (a) the
        variant that we used in the first set of simulations and that uses all trials to obtain a
        single SSRT estimate (henceforth, the experiment-wide integration method) and (b) a
        block-based integration method that estimated SSRT for each block separately (there were 60
        trials per block, 15 of which were signal trials) and then took the average of these four
        estimates.</p>
      <p>The box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0956797612457390">Figure 3</xref> show that
        the mean method overestimates SSRT when RT τ increases or when mean RT gradually increases
        over trials (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612457390">Table 1</xref>).
        By contrast, the experiment-wide integration method tended to underestimate SSRT, especially
        when the slowing factor increased (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0956797612457390">Fig.
          3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612457390">Table 1</xref>). The
        block-based integration method did not show such a consistent bias. These conclusions were
        supported by the ANOVAs reported in Table S4 of the Supplemental Material.</p>

      <p>We found that the mean method was strongly influenced by response slowing. One possible
        explanation for this finding is that the mean method assumes that the probability of
        responding approximates .50. However, we found that when the slowing factor increased,
          <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) tended to decrease: When the slowing factor was large,
        the tracking procedure could not keep up with the changes in RT, so
        <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) would be lower than .50 (see Table S3 in the Supplemental
        Material). Therefore, we reestimated SSRT using only those simulated subjects for which .40
        &lt; <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) &lt; .60; these values are based on the criterion
        discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612457390">Verbruggen, Logan, and

        when only the central estimates were included (see Figs. S3 and S4 in the Supplemental
        Material).</p>
      <p>The second set of simulations demonstrated that the mean method and experiment-wide
        integration method were influenced by response slowing. In a third set of simulations, we
        used a random slowing factor for each simulated subject to explore the correlation between
        slowing and the degree of over- or underestimation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0956797612457390">Figure 4</xref> shows that when RT τ was low and the

        the degree of slowing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0956797612457390">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0956797612457390">6</xref></sup> Researchers have argued that
        such negative correlations could be due to proactive suppression of motor output or changes

        that this negative correlation could be due to a bias in SSRT estimation. This bias was not
        observed when SSRT was estimated for each block separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0956797612457390">Fig. 4</xref>). As expected based on the previous sets of

      <title>Conclusions and Practical Guidelines</title>
      <p>In the present study, we explored to what extent the skew of the RT distribution and
        gradual slowing of response latencies influences the mean and integration SSRT estimates.
        The mean method is often used because it is very easy: SSRT can be estimated simply by
        subtracting the mean SSD from the mean RT. However, our simulations show that this approach
        overestimates SSRT when the RT distribution is skewed to the right (i.e., when RT τ is
        large) or when RTs increase gradually over the course of the experiment. We demonstrated
        that individual or group differences in RT skew or response slowing could result in spurious
        inhibitory differences. Unfortunately, such RT differences may occur frequently. For
        example, studies have shown that SSRT is longer for children with ADHD than for children
        without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612457390">Lijffijt, Kenemans,
          Verbaten, &amp; van Engeland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612457390">Oosterlaan &amp; Sergeant, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612457390">Schachar &amp; Logan, 1990</xref>). However,
        a recent study estimated that τ was much higher in children with ADHD than in children
        without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612457390">Tiftein et al.,
        2011</xref>). Thus, the mean method will overestimate SSRT differences between ADHD children
        and children without ADHD and possibly produce spurious differences. Thus, we argue that the
        mean method should be abandoned because it is overly susceptible to the shape of the RT
        distribution.</p>
      <p>The integration method fared better in the first set of simulations: There was a trend to
        underestimate SSRT slightly (approximately 4 ms), but there were no obvious group
        differences caused by changes in the shape of the RT distribution. This is consistent with a
        recent reliability analysis that used split-half reliability measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612457390">Congdon et al., 2012</xref>). However, the second and third
        set of simulations showed that the small underestimation bias for the integration method
        became more pronounced when there is gradual slowing of RTs across blocks. This
        underestimation bias may explain the previously observed negative correlations between SSRT
        and response slowing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612457390">Jahfari et
          al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612457390">Leotti &amp; Wager,
          2010</xref>). Thus, we have demonstrated that the experiment-wide integration method
        results in reliable and unbiased estimates unless subjects slow their RT gradually.</p>
      <p>The gradual slowing of RTs may be reduced by clear advance instructions (e.g., by stressing
        speed in the go task and explaining the staircase-tracking procedure) and by providing
        feedback after every trial (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612457390">Ridderinkhof et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612457390">Verbruggen et al., 2004</xref>) or after every block (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612457390">Verbruggen, Logan, &amp; Stevens, 2008</xref>). Thus, we
        argue that in standard stop tasks, researchers should provide clear instructions and
        implement feedback procedures to discourage excessive strategic slowing.</p>
      <p>Even when feedback is provided, slowing may still be observed in certain subjects (e.g.,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612457390">Verbruggen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612457390">Verbruggen, Logan, et al., 2008</xref>).
        Researchers can exclude those subjects who slow their responses substantially; our
        simulations suggest that the underestimation bias appeared when the mean of the normal part
        of the distribution doubled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0956797612457390">7</xref></sup> However, this may result in the exclusion of a large number of subjects in
        some experiments, which could induce an exclusion bias. Also, researchers may be
        specifically interested in the correlation between slowing and SSRT. Recently, several
        authors have argued that strategy adjustments may be an important aspect of successful stop
        performance and, more generally, impulse control in everyday life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612457390">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612457390">Bissett &amp; Logan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612457390">Leotti &amp; Wager, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612457390">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>). Feedback about
        slowing may not be provided when such strategic adjustments are examined. Furthermore,
        excluding subjects who slow substantially is not appropriate in such studies. The second and
        third set of simulations show that a block-based version of the integration method is less
        susceptible to bias from response slowing. When SSRT was estimated for each block separately
        (number of no-signal trials per block = 45; number of signal trials per block = 15) and then
        averaged, we obtained a reliable and unbiased SSRT even when there was substantial response
        slowing. Additional analyses (Figs. S5–S6 in the Supplemental Material) suggest that
        approximately 40 to 80 trials are required per block (25% of which are signal trials). If
        there are fewer trials, the estimates become too noisy; if there are more trials, the
        underestimation bias starts to emerge. We recommend that there are at least 50 signals in
        total. Thus, we feel that researchers should estimate SSRT for each block separately when
        strategic slowing is observed and subjects cannot be excluded.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that slowing could be interpreted as a violation of the <italic>context
          independence</italic> and the <italic>stochastic independence</italic> assumptions of the
        race model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612457390">Logan &amp; Cowan,
          1984</xref>). Context independence (also referred to as signal independence) refers to the
        assumption that the RT distribution is the same for no-signal trials and stop-signal trials.
        Stochastic independence refers to the assumption that trial-by-trial variability in RT is
        unrelated to trial-by-trial variability in SSRT. Gradual slowing of RT does not necessarily
        violate these assumptions: Because subjects cannot predict whether a stop signal will occur
        in the standard version of a stop task, they are expected to slow down on all trials
        (including no-signal trials). In other words, the assumptions of the race model hold as long
        as slowing occurs to a similar degree on both signal and no-signal trials. Note also that
        the race model does not make assumptions about the shape of the finishing-time
        distributions. Thus, skew should not influence the SSRT estimations. The results of the
        first set of simulations demonstrated that this was the case for the integration method.</p>
      <p>To conclude, our results demonstrate that the central SSRT estimates, which were previously
        thought to be most reliable, are strongly influenced by the right tail of the RT
        distribution and gradual slowing of RTs. Therefore, we recommend that researchers abandon
        the mean method to estimate SSRT and instead use the experiment-wide or block-based
        integration method to reliably estimate the latency of response inhibition.</p>

          <p>In some studies, SSRT has been estimated by subtracting the mean SSD from the median
            RT. This <italic>median</italic> method is a variant of the integration method that
            assumes that <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) is always exactly .50. This is rarely
            the case. Thus, the median method is usually a less accurate version of the integration
            method; therefore, it is not further considered in the main analyses. We report the
            results for the median method in Table S8 in the Supplemental Material. The table shows
            that when “subjects” did not slow and <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) was close to
            .50, the results were very similar to the results for the integration method (as
            expected). However, when slowing was implemented, SSRT was overestimated because
              <italic>p</italic>(respond|signal) was often lower than .50 (see Tables S3–S5). The
            overestimation bias was less pronounced than the bias observed for the mean method
            because the median is less influenced by the tail of the distribution than the mean
            is.</p>

          <p>Because there was an equal number of signal trials in each block, a block-based variant

          <p>We obtained very similar results when we implemented slowing differently. On each
            trial, we obtained an RT from a single ex-Gaussian distribution with constant
            parameters, µ(subject), σ, τ. This RT was then multiplied by the slowing factor. For
            example, if the slowing factor would have been 1.5 and there were three trials, the RTs
            would be RT(sampled) on the first trial, RT(sampled) × 1.25 on the second trial, and
            RT(sampled) × 1.5 on the third trial. The negative correlations and underestimation bias
            were still present for the standard integration method (if anything, the effects were

            this suggests that the experiment-based integration method will underestimate SSRT when
            subjects slow down. Finally, for the block-based integration method, the overall
            correlation was 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(398) = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> = .74, which
            suggests that the estimates are not influenced by slowing. We obtained very similar
            correlations between the degree of slowing and the difference between SSRT(estimated)
            and SSRT(true): For the mean method, the overall correlation was 0.29,
              <italic>t</italic>(398) = 5.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; for the integration
            method, the overall correlation was −0.21, <italic>t</italic>(398) = −4.36,
              <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; finally, for the block-based integration, the overall
            correlation was 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(398) = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = .66. This
            confirms that the observed correlations between slowing and SSRT were due to an
            estimation bias.</p>

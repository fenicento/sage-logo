<p>Germline testing for familial cases of myeloid leukemia in adults is becoming more common with the recognition of multiple genetic syndromes predisposing people to bone marrow disease. Currently, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments approved testing exists for several myeloid leukemia predisposition syndromes: familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML), caused by mutations in <italic>RUNX1</italic>; familial AML with mutated <italic>CEBPA</italic>; familial myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia with mutated <italic>GATA2</italic>; and the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, including dyskeratosis congenita, a disease of abnormal telomere maintenance. With the recognition of additional families with a genetic component to their leukemia, new predisposition alleles will likely be identified. We highlight how to recognize and manage these cases as well as outline the characteristics of the major known syndromes. We look forward to future research increasing our understanding of the scope of inherited myeloid leukemia syndromes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Familial cases of adult myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) are considered rare, but are likely to be more common than currently appreciated. Understanding the recognized syndromes is critical for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion. Familial MDS/AML can be divided into three groups: those for which Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved testing exists, those emerging from basic research and requiring validation in additional families or development of clinical testing, and those without an identified genetic basis. Examples of familial MDS/AML syndromes for which clinical testing is available include: familial platelet disorder (FPD) with propensity to AML, caused by mutations in <italic>RUNX1</italic>; familial AML with mutated <italic>CEBPA</italic>; familial MDS and acute leukemia (AL) with mutated <italic>GATA2</italic>; and the inherited bone marrow failure (IBMF) syndromes, including dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a disease of abnormal telomere maintenance, and Fanconi anemia (FA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2040620713487399">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2040620713487399">2</xref>). Clinical care of adult patients with a suspected inherited predisposition to MDS/AML is complicated by a paucity of clinical guidelines for both testing and clinical management of patients found to have a predisposing mutation. Recently, our group collaborated with others in the field to begin formulating such recommendations for adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2040620713487399">Churpek <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>]. For recommendations regarding pediatric patients, please refer to Seif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2040620713487399">Seif, 2011</xref>]. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the genetic basis and clinical presentation of the known adult familial MDS/AML syndromes, and propose guidelines to determine when genetic testing is indicated.</p>

<title>How to recognize and manage patients with a familial myeloid leukemia syndrome</title>
<p>To recognize which patients may have an inherited predisposition to myeloid leukemia, clinicians must take a complete family history and be familiar with the characteristics of familial MDS/AML syndromes. Certain features of the history or laboratory values may increase the likelihood of a particular syndrome over others in individual cases. In the next section, we review the clinical pathological characteristics of each syndrome. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2040620713487399">Figure 3</xref> shows a recently published model for detection of leukemia predisposition syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2040620713487399">Churpek <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>]. Consultation with a certified genetic counselor and the documentation of a complete family history are integral to this assessment.</p>

<p>The assembly of a family pedigree aids in developing a differential diagnosis to determine the most likely genetic syndrome in the family, allowing construction of a genetic testing plan appropriate for the patient’s clinical situation. Patients under consideration for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched relative warrant expedited genetic testing to rule out a familial MDS/AL predisposition syndrome and avoid use of stem cells from a relative carrying a mutation in the same predisposition gene. For these cases, testing of multiple genes at once, rather than sequential testing, is appropriate. During pretesting genetic counseling, patients and their families should receive education on the principles of human genetics and details about what is known about the specific hereditary syndromes being considered in their case. This information forms the basis of the informed consent process for genetic testing, ensuring that patients understand the risks and benefits of genetic testing, the possible testing outcomes, alternatives to genetic testing (such as screening tests without testing), and the potential impact of test results on patients and their families.</p>
<p>When genetic testing is sent for patients with MDS/AML, it is important to remember that blood is an affected tissue, and many of the genes mutated in the germline are also found mutated somatically, confounding the interpretation of genetic testing on blood or bone marrow samples. For this reason, we advocate genetic testing using skin fibroblasts for germline analysis. In practice, a skin biopsy is easily performed with minimal local anesthetic and a punch biopsy or a small shaving of skin collected at the site of the skin incision during a bone marrow biopsy. Skin fibroblasts are then grown <italic>in vitro</italic> in a CLIA-approved laboratory. In our experience, growing skin fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> takes a minimum of 2 weeks, but more often up to 4 weeks, and in some laboratories even longer, all depending on culture conditions and biopsy handling. This is a significant length of time that is added to the turnaround time for germline testing, and in certain clinical settings may not be acceptable when cases require expedited results for patient management decisions. In this situation, buccal swab or saliva samples, which can be obtained immediately, may be preferred. However, both buccal swab and saliva samples contain up to 50% contaminating lymphocytes, possibly confounding results.</p>
<p>All individuals who undergo genetic testing should have a follow-up plan for disclosure of genetic test results when they become available. A disclosure visit for either negative or positive results should ideally occur in a face-to-face setting and include post-testing genetic counseling focused on educating patients about the meaning of their test results, any additional testing if needed, the implications of the results for the patient’s health, and any screening or management recommendations based on the results or the family history.</p>
<p>In the event of a positive genetic test result, it is important to discuss the implications of these results for other at-risk family members and to inform patients of their duty to share this information with at-risk family members. Individual genetic counseling would also be recommended for these family members. Additional health implications should be discussed, such as the risk of nonhematologic malignancies associated with certain germline disorders, including telomere biology disorders (TBDs) or FA, as well as the implications for treatment sensitivity and the possibility of alternative treatment protocols for these individuals. All mutation carriers should be counseled to avoid exposure to known bone marrow toxins, such as smoking and heavy alcohol use. Other genetic issues, including recurrence risk and preimplantation genetic testing for potential parents, should be addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2040620713487399">Churpek <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>].</p>
<p>We recommend that all mutation carriers undergo a baseline bone marrow biopsy to assess for occult malignancy, as well as twice annual physical examinations and complete blood count (CBC) with differential testing. If there is a significant change from baseline, the CBC should be repeated 1–2 weeks later. If the change persists, a bone marrow evaluation should be repeated. If a mutation carrier develops a bone marrow malignancy, we recommend against using stem cells from any donor who also carries the familial MDS/AML predisposition mutation, since poor outcomes including poor engraftment, graft failure, and donor-derived leukemia have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2040620713487399">Buijs <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2040620713487399">Fogarty <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2040620713487399">Owen <italic>et al.</italic> 2008b</xref>]. For families with a clinical history consistent with a predisposition to MDS/AML, but who do not carry a mutation in one of the defined familial MDS/AML predisposition genes, the treating physician should consider the strength of the confirmed family history as well as the availability of unrelated donors and the urgency of the transplant when deciding whether or not to use an HLA-matched related donor.</p>
<p>In addition to genetic testing, phenotypic assays exist for the detection of some of the familial MDS/AML predisposition syndromes and are sometimes the preferred manner to detect underlying germline disorders. Telomere length testing detects TBDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2040620713487399">Alter <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>], including DC, for which genetic testing detects abnormalities in about 60% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2040620713487399">Walne <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2040620713487399">Young, 2012</xref>]. The diagnosis of FA is made through the diepoxybutane (DEB) breakage assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2040620713487399">Auerbach, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2040620713487399">Kee and D’Andrea, 2012</xref>]. When indicated, these phenotypic assays can be followed by additional testing to determine the precise genetic mutation present in most cases.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>FPD/AML is a rare Mendelian disorder characterized by clinical bleeding due to platelet dysfunction, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and a propensity to develop myeloid malignancies. Among the more than 30 families described with FPD/AML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2040620713487399">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2040620713487399">2</xref>), most carriers have a hemizygous mutation in the <italic>RUNX1</italic> gene, which encodes one subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor that controls genes essential for hematopoiesis. Within individual FPD/AML families, carriers of the same <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutation display heterogeneity in their degree of platelet dysfunction, with some family members having moderate thrombocytopenia and bleeding, whereas others have neither. In addition, some family members develop myeloid malignancies, although not always the same type, and other mutation carriers do not succumb to leukemia. Furthermore, different FPD/AML families have varying risks of progressing to myeloid malignancy, which likely reflects the fact that each family carries unique mutations that disrupt various domains within the protein.</p>
<p>As more families have been examined, a spectrum of <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutations has been identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2040620713487399">Figure 1(a)</xref>), and as noted above, the molecular characteristics of different mutations may account for some of the varying risk of leukemia. Currently, the reported <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutations resulting in FPD/AML include gene deletions or duplications, frameshift and nonsense mutations throughout the gene, and missense point mutations within the highly conserved RUNT domain at residues important for DNA binding or heterodimerization. Truncating mutations within the RUNT domain result in hypomorphic alleles, whereas those that truncate the protein at the extreme C terminus activate the baseline transcriptional activity of the protein. Although biochemically these mutations have opposing effects, interestingly they result in the same clinical syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2040620713487399">Churpek <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>]. The mechanisms that underlie progression to leukemia in <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutation carriers remain to be discovered, but proposed mechanisms include haploinsufficiency for tumor suppression, dominant-negative effects on normal <italic>RUNX1</italic> function, acquisition of a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in the nonmutated germline allele, and acquisition of cooperating mutations. Germline testing on individuals with suspected <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutations should include tests sensitive to deletions, duplications, and rearrangements, which may go undetected by standard sequencing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2040620713487399">Jongmans <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2040620713487399">Katzaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2040620713487399">Shinawi <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>]. These alterations may be detected through genomic arrays or multiplex ligation-probe dependent amplification analysis. Microdeletions of chromosome 21q22, a region containing <italic>RUNX1</italic>, are associated with growth and developmental delay, dysmorphic features, congenital heart defects, and platelet abnormalities with predisposition to MDS/AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2040620713487399">Izumi <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2040620713487399">Katzaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2040620713487399">Melis <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>].</p>

<title>Presentation</title>
<p>As described above, FPD/AML families may be identified by the presence of qualitative and quantitative platelet defects in a family with multiple individuals who have developed myeloid leukemias. Of note, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one case of lymphoma have also been described within these families. The variability seen within and among families makes this syndrome particularly difficult to diagnose. Not all families or family members demonstrate a low platelet count, and a clinical bleeding history can be difficult to elicit. For this reason, we recommend testing individuals for germline <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutations if more than two individuals in the family have been diagnosed with a myeloid malignancy, in particular when at least one individual is thrombocytopenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2040620713487399">Churpek <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2040620713487399">Owen <italic>et al.</italic> 2008b</xref>].</p>

<sec id="section8-2040620713487399">
<title>Management</title>
<p>The management of a patient with a germline <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutation and a bone marrow derived malignancy is dictated by the nature of the leukemia. However, the diagnosis of an underlying germline mutation raises the issue of using an allogeneic stem-cell transplant for consolidation therapy, since transplant is the only way to rid the bone marrow of the underlying predisposing allele. In this case, as we describe above, great care must be given to performing <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutation testing in HLA-matched relatives in a timely manner, and if none exists, to the use of an unrelated donor.</p>
<p>It is much more difficult to manage <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutation carriers who have not developed myeloid malignancies, since clinical guidelines for following these patients have only been discussed recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2040620713487399">Churpek <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>]. Because FPD/AML displays strong anticipation (the phenomenon in which members of younger generations present with disease at earlier ages than those of prior generations), close clinical follow up for members of the youngest generations in the family is particularly critical. Generally, we recommend performing a baseline CBC with differential and a bone marrow biopsy. It is also prudent to screen all first-degree relatives to identify those who are HLA identical before malignancy is diagnosed, since this information will expedite the clinical management of the affected individual. We recommend performing a CBC yearly, and repeating a bone marrow biopsy if there is any significant change in the peripheral blood counts.</p>

The familial form is associated with bi-allelic <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutation, generally with the first mutation present in the germline within the 5’ end of the gene, accompanied by acquisition of a second 3’ mutation within the leukemia.

<p>No specific genotype–phenotype correlations have been described with germline <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutations, and most patients’ leukemias have a normal karyotype. AML with a germline <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutation and a normal karyotype confers a favorable prognosis, with overall survival in the 50–65% range compared with 25–40% in normal-karyotype AML without a germline <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2040620713487399">Bienz <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2040620713487399">Fröhling <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2040620713487399">Marcucci <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2040620713487399">Preudhomme <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>]. Approximately 9% of patients with AML and 15–18% of patients with AML with normal karyotype have either a germline, or more commonly, somatic <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2040620713487399">Renneville <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>].

The familial and sporadic forms of the disease share similar pathologic features, including normal cytogenetic analysis, a preponderance of FAB subtypes M1 and M2, numerous Auer rods seen in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts, and aberrant CD7 expression on blasts demonstrated by flow cytometry. Genetic testing of the single exon comprising <italic>CEBPA</italic> is clinically available, with greater than 99% sensitivity for mutations within the coding region.

<title>Management</title>
<p>Management of cases of familial AML with mutated <italic>CEBPA</italic> may include the use of allogeneic stem-cell transplant, being the only modality capable of replacing the mutated allele within the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2040620713487399">Stelljes <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. However, given the relative favorable prognosis of familial <italic>CEBPA</italic> AML, the risks of allogeneic stem cell-transplant must be considered on an individual basis. Of note, patients with familial <italic>CEBPA</italic>-mutated AML may be at increased risk of developing additional malignant clones after cure of their initial leukemia, often with acquired <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutations distinctive from those found in the original leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2040620713487399">Pabst <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>]. Therefore, both longer and more frequent post-cure surveillance may be appropriate in patients with the familial form of disease.</p>
<p>Genetic counseling is a critical component of management since penetrance is nearly complete, as discussed above. Although thus far all reported patients also had an affected parent, <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in a proband and early death of a parent from other causes prior to development of AML could potentially confound diagnosis. In a proband with an apparent <italic>de novo</italic> germline mutation, confirmatory evaluation of parents should be done, including CBC, hematologic indices, peripheral blood smear and testing for the germline <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutation identified in the proband. Siblings of a proband with a germline <italic>CEBPA</italic> mutation are at 50% risk of carrying the mutation. Even when parents are clinically unaffected, siblings of a proband are still at increased risk due to the possibility of incomplete penetrance of a germline mutation in a parent or germline mosaicism in a parent (causing fewer than 50% of the germ cells to carry the deleterious mutation). Children of a proband each have a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Genetic counseling should be offered to individuals with known familial AML with mutated <italic>CEBPA</italic> ideally before pregnancy to determine genetic risk in their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2040620713487399">Churpek <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>].</p>

<title>Presentation</title>
<p>Several <italic>GATA2</italic> mutation-carrying pedigrees have been described that display no distinguishing phenotypic abnormalities other than early-onset familial MDS or AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2040620713487399">Hahn <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. These families displayed highly penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance of early-onset MDS or AML, resulting in poor outcomes unless successfully transplanted. The clinical characteristics of MDS/AML in these pedigrees is variable, with different FAB subtypes as well as variable cytogenetic abnormalities, including monosomy 7, trisomy 8, and trisomy 21.</p>
<p>Emberger syndrome is defined by primary lymphedema, confined to the lower extremities and genitals, with myelodysplasia progressing to AML. It may also present with a low CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, cutaneous warts, and sensorineural deafness. Emberger syndrome occurs both sporadically and heritably in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance. One series identified eight independent <italic>GATA2</italic> variants in 14 individuals with Emberger syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2040620713487399">Ostergaard <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. The cytogenetic abnormalities seen in these individuals also include monosomy 7, and their MDS often rapidly transforms to AML.</p>
<p>Recently described, the MonoMAC syndrome comprises severe monocytopenia and severe infections with nontuberculous <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>, typically <italic>M. avium</italic> complex (MAC). The phenotype may also include natural killer cell and B-cell lymphocytopenia, disseminated viral and opportunistic fungal infections, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and severely decreased circulating and tissue dendritic cells, as well as a predisposition to MDS/AML or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2040620713487399">Vinh <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>]. This syndrome has been associated with mutations in <italic>GATA2</italic> in at least 20 patients so far. In these patients, the infectious and pulmonary features of MonoMAC syndrome tend to predate the development of overt MDS by many years and are thought to arise from tissue macrophage dysfunction mediated by GATA2 deficiency.</p>
<p>Compared with patients with <italic>de novo</italic> MDS, patients with MonoMAC display a significantly younger average age of onset (33 years versus 70–80 years) as well as distinctive bone marrow features, such as hypocellularity, significant fibrosis, and multilineage dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2040620713487399">Hsu <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>].

<title>Background</title>
<p>Within the spectrum of IBMF syndromes, TBDs are associated with abnormal telomere maintenance and predisposition to MDS/AML. DC is the prototypical example of a TBD. Classic features of DC include the mucocutaneous triad of nail dystrophy, abnormal reticular skin pigmentation, and oral leukoplakia, as well as a predisposition to malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2040620713487399">Dokal, 2011</xref>]. Patients with DC have a high risk of MDS, with an observed expected ratio of 2663 (95% confidence interval 858–6215) and a mean age of onset of 35 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2040620713487399">Alter <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>]. Not all patients with a TBD demonstrate the classic features of DC, since both the genetic causes and clinical presentations of TBDs are heterogeneous. Patients may present initially with bone marrow failure, MDS, or pulmonary fibrosis, without demonstrating mucocutaneous features of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2040620713487399">Armanios <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2040620713487399">Yamaguchi <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>].

<p>TBDs affect regenerating tissues in which telomere maintenance is important.

The clinical diagnosis of DC is based on the presence of the major features of the disease, which include the mucocutaneous triad and bone marrow failure, as well as the presence of multisystem features of the disease: epiphora, learning difficulties/developmental delay/mental retardation, pulmonary disease, short stature, extensive dental caries, esophageal stricture, premature hair graying or loss, hyperhiderosis, or malignancy.

<p>Currently, 15 FA genes are associated with the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2040620713487399">Kee and D’Andrea, 2012</xref>], with <italic>FANCA</italic> demonstrating the highest prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2040620713487399">Wang, 2007</xref>]. FA genes function in repairing DNA crosslinks associated with the FA/BRCA pathway. Subtyping FA complementation groups is useful in the management of patients with FA, since certain groups, such as <italic>FANCA</italic>, demonstrate milder disease with later onset of bone marrow failure, whereas <italic>FANCG</italic> generally results in more severe hematologic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2040620713487399">Faivre <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>]. <italic>FANCD1</italic> is identical to <italic>BRCA2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2040620713487399">Wang, 2007</xref>], with homozygous mutations resulting in FA and heterozygous mutations leading to an increased susceptibility to breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2040620713487399">Howlett <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the clinical presentation and genetic causes are highly variable, in general, FA results in hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. DEB, a DNA crosslinking agent, is used in the DEB-induced chromosome breakage assay to diagnose FA. Mitomycin C may also be used in place of DEB in the assay. Peripheral blood from a patient with suspected FA is cultured and treated with DEB, which induces irreparable DNA crosslinking and chromosome breakage in FA cells visible in Giemsa-stained metaphase cells but is innocuous to wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2040620713487399">Auerbach, 2003</xref>].

<p>The proband presented with pancytopenia at age 20 and a bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2040620713487399">Figure 4(e)</xref>). Of note, the proband’s brother had also been diagnosed with AA at age 16. Based on the occurrence of two family members with AA, a workup for germline mutations leading to familial bone marrow failures syndromes was undertaken, including telomere length testing (which was normal) and <italic>SRP72</italic> mutation testing, which was positive for a mutation when performed on a research basis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-2040620713487399">
<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>SRP72</italic> encodes one of six protein subunits of the signal recognition particle (SRP), part of the cellular apparatus responsible for nascent protein processing and trafficking. By means of whole-exome sequencing, a mutation in <italic>SRP72</italic> was identified in a family with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of bone marrow failure and congenital neural deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2040620713487399">Kirwan <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>]. Three siblings in this family had AA and deafness, and an additional sibling with normal hearing had normal blood counts. The mother had MDS. All had normal karyotypes. Subsequent screening of 96 additional patients with bone marrow failure identified one more family in which both the index case and her mother had MDS and an <italic>SRP72</italic> mutation. In this family, however, neither affected individual had hearing loss, although the index case presented with possible labyrinthitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2040620713487399">Kirwan <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>].</p>
<p>To date, only these two pedigrees have been identified with <italic>SRP72</italic> mutations and AA/MDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2040620713487399">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2040620713487399">2</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to describe a particular phenotype associated with this mutation. However, as more patients are screened for the mutation, an association with hearing loss or other audiovestibular abnormalities may become evident, as in the case of <italic>GATA2</italic> mutation. As with other familial bone marrow failure syndromes, attention to possible inheritance of seemingly unrelated abnormalities will be important to elucidate the phenotype.</p>

<sec id="section31-2040620713487399">
<title>Presentation</title>
<p>Since only a small number of families with <italic>SRP72</italic> mutations have been identified to date, it is difficult to describe a consistent presentation, but bone marrow failure may precede the development of a myeloid bone marrow malignancy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-2040620713487399">
<title>Management</title>
<p>As with the other syndromes, no special initial management of the myeloid malignancy is undertaken. However, subsequently, if a germline <italic>SRP72</italic> mutation is found, consideration should be given to the use of allogeneic stem-cell transplant using a nonmutated donor.</p>

<title>Thrombocytopenia 2 (ANKRD26; OMIM 610855; ANKRD26 is composed of 34 exons on chromosome 10p12.1)</title>
<sec id="section34-2040620713487399">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Thrombocytopenia 2 (THC2) is an inherited thrombocytopenia with mild thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendency with normal <italic>in vitro</italic> platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2040620713487399">Noris <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. In 78 people from 21 families known to have THC2, 18 mutations were identified within a 19 base-pair region of the <italic>ANKRD26</italic> 5’ untranslated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2040620713487399">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2040620713487399">Noris <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2040620713487399">Pippucci <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. Expression studies showed that these mutations resulted in increased gene expression, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism of action. Among 105 people with confirmed or suspected <italic>ANKRD26</italic> mutations, 10 developed hematologic malignancies, including seven with acute leukemias, five of which were myeloid and two of which were undefined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2040620713487399">Noris <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. The overall incidence of development of hematologic malignancies was 240 out of 100,000, and of acute leukemia was 167 out of 100,000, both elevated over expected levels.</p>

<sec id="section35-2040620713487399">
<title>Presentation</title>
<p>To date, patients with <italic>ANKRD26</italic> mutations are recognized by their familial inheritance of thrombocytopenia. Although there is a suspicion that these mutations may lead to an increased risk of hematologic disease, additional families need to be studied to be confident about this relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-2040620713487399">
<title>Management</title>
<p>The management of hematologic malignancies in these patients is according to the diagnosis. No additional treatment measures need to be instituted. As discussed above, if a firm causative relationship is established between <italic>ANKRD26</italic> mutations and the development of hematopoietic diseases, consideration should be given to the use of allogeneic stem-cell transplant.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we advocate that all physicians caring for patients with MDS/AML become familiar with the inherited predisposition syndromes underlying the development of the malignancy in certain families. Recognition of these syndromes is crucial to proper clinical management of patients with an inherited susceptibility and for genetic screening of additional family members. Although currently CLIA-approved testing exists only for inherited mutations in <italic>RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2</italic>, and the IBMF syndromes including DC, we look forward to the development of additional clinical tests as more inherited syndromes are identified.</p>
<p>We recognize that the anticipated rapid incorporation of next-generation sequencing into clinical practice may change our diagnostic approach, if full exome, transcriptome, and genome sequencing become standard practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2040620713487399">Biesecker <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2040620713487399">Shyr and Liu, 2013</xref>]. For the moment, if physicians exhaust CLIA-approved genetic testing for a patient with a high suspicion for an inherited leukemia syndrome, further testing occurs in the research setting. However, many experimental protocols are now written with exchange of medically relevant information back to participating individuals, allowing patients access to the results of research-based testing. We encourage all physicians who care for these patients to refer patients for appropriate genetic counseling, testing, and if appropriate, research studies that could lead to the identification of additional predisposition alleles.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Metacarpal shaft fractures are common injuries that frequently unite with some shortening of the metacarpal. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of metacarpal shortening on digital flexion force. The index metacarpal of six cadaveric upper limbs was incrementally shortened. The flexion force produced at the end of the finger was recorded using a small load cell. At full extension, there was no significant change in flexion force produced regardless of the amount of shortening. However, at 50% aggregate flexion the loss of force became statistically significant at a shortening of 7.5 mm or more. At full digital flexion, the loss of force became statistically significant at shortening of 5 mm or more. At increasing amounts of finger flexion, progressive metacarpal shortening produces proportionally greater loss of fingertip flexion force. From this study it appears that metacarpal shortening of up to 5 mm should give minimal loss of finger flexion force.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metacarpal fractures account for 18% of all below-elbow fractures in the United States, with a peak incidence in the third decade for men and second decade for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412461589">Chung and Spilson, 2001</xref>). Comminuted and spiral metacarpal fractures can displace in multiple planes leading to angulation, shortening, and rotation. Guidelines recommending acceptable limits for angulation and rotation are available, however the limits for shortening remain controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412461589">Henry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412461589">Stern, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The goal of the current study is to determine the effect of metacarpal shortening on finger flexion strength by evaluating digital flexor tendon function in a cadaveric model via biomechanical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412461589" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Six fresh-frozen cadaveric limbs, disarticulated at the elbow, were allowed to warm to room temperature. Each limb was free from prior surgery, trauma or obvious musculoskeletal disease. In each specimen, the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon to the index finger was identified and sutured with No. 5 Ethibond (Ethicon, Inc.; Somerville, NJ) using a Krakow-type stitch. Two 5 mm Steinmann pins were inserted in the radial diaphysis to mount the forearm in the testing jig. Forearm rotation was controlled by placing a 2 mm K-wire across the proximal radioulnar joint. Another 2 mm K-wire was driven up the middle finger metacarpal, across the carpus, and into the distal radius to stabilize the wrist in neutral.</p>
<p>Prior to performing the metacarpal shortening osteotomy, we modified a six-hole 2.4 mm limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC/DCP) (Synthes, Inc.; West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA). The pre-existing holes were burred out in sets of three to create two oblong holes so the plate could slide longitudinally relative to the screws.</p>
<p>The index metacarpal in each of the six cadaver limbs was exposed through a standard dorsal approach. The modified plate was positioned and the holes for the screws drilled. A 15 mm segment of bone was resected from the mid-diaphysis of the metacarpal with an oscillating saw using a prefabricated stainless steel 15 mm guide pinned in place with a size 0.062 K-wire. We made six spacer blocks from titanium rods surrounded by polyethylene. These ranged from 2.5 mm to 15 mm thick in 2.5 mm increments. The titanium protruded approximately 2.5 mm from each end of the blocks and was designed to fit securely in each end of the metacarpal intramedullary canal. The native length of the metacarpal could therefore be restored by using the 15 mm spacer block, be maximally shortened 15 mm by not using any spacer, and intermediate lengths be tested with the other spacers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412461589">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates the metacarpal fixed with the 7.5 mm spacer block and modified LC/DCP plate.</p>

<p>Cadaver limbs were individually mounted in a custom-built testing jig designed to be used within the mechanical testing and simulation (MTS) machine. The FDP tendon suture was attached to the load cell on the MTS machine, which pulled on the tendon and measured the force required. The end of the index finger was attached to another load cell that was positioned at the end of the finger and attached via a suture through the distal phalanx and a loop tied over a button. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412461589">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates how force was measured.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1753193412461589-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>The index fingers were tested in three finger positions: full extension; 50% of total aggregate flexion; and at full flexion. Flexion of 50% was determined by measuring with the fingertip position midway between full extension and full flexion. The index finger of each of the six cadaver limbs was flexed/extended through a full range of movement six times (cycles). The first five cycles served to precondition the tissues and the data was collected on the last cycle. This method was repeated for each of the seven different metacarpal lengths for each of the specimens. The order of testing the spacers was randomized. Additionally, the testing jig allowed for the repositioning of the hand so that the relationship of the finger remained in the same position relative to the load cell even when the metacarpal length was changed.</p>
<p>For each specimen at each of the seven metacarpal lengths, the FDP tendon force simulated for testing ranged from zero to approximately 32 N. We selected this value because it is within the range of force normally applied by a finger and would not exceed the strength of our construct. The resulting finger flexion force was measured at approximately every half Newton of FDP tendon force. Graphs of finger flexion force versus FDP tendon force were generated for each of the seven metacarpal lengths and the slopes of the lines calculated. Statistical analysis comparing the changes in slope and the differences in finger flexion forces at 25 N of FDP tendon force were performed by calculating differences of least squares means. A <italic>p</italic>-value of less then 0.05 was considered to be significant.</p>

<p>A representative plot generated from the MTS data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412461589">Figure 3</xref>. The values recorded during flexion were slightly greater than those seen in relaxation secondary to hysteresis. Therefore, only the pulling phase of the hysteresis loop was used in the data analysis.</p>

<p>Differences of least squares means testing for each of the three positions tested found finger flexion force was least affected with the finger in full extension. In extension, the change in the slope did not become significant until 12.5 mm of shortening was reached (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008) and finger flexion force produced at 25 N of FDP tendon force did not show a significant difference, even with 15 mm of shortening (<italic>P</italic> = 0.9144). At 50% aggregate flexion, shortening was found to have an effect on both slope (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0029) and finger flexion force produced at 25 N of FDP tendon force (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0013), both becoming significant at 7.5 mm of metacarpal shortening. With full flexion, a significant effect was noted at 5 mm of metacarpal shortening for both slope (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0048) and finger flexion force produced at 25 N of FDP tendon force (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0013).</p>
<p>As the metacarpal shortening increased, there was a decrease in both the slope of the plotted data and finger flexion force produced at 25 N of FDP tendon force. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412461589">Table 1</xref> presents the percentage decrease in slope and in finger flexion force at 25 N of FDP tendon force at 50% aggregate flexion and full flexion at metacarpal shortenings that were found to be statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There have been many clinical studies on metacarpal fractures, but none has assessed objectively how much shortening is acceptable. The authors variously make no mention of shortening as an outcome measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412461589">Freeland et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412461589">Greene et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412461589">Jahss, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412461589">Lewis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412461589">Meyer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412461589">Swanson, 1970</xref>), mention shortening but present no data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412461589">Edwards et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412461589">Hastings, 1987</xref>), or determine an acceptable limit of shortening but provide no rationale for their determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412461589">Burkhalter and Reyes, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412461589">Butt, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412461589">Gropper and Bowen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412461589">Littler, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412461589">Workman, 1964</xref>). Reported acceptable limits vary from 0 to 10 mm.</p>
<p>Metacarpal shortening often produces a mild cosmetic deformity, with loss of the normal prominence of the metacarpal head. The functional effect of shortening on the extrinsic flexor and extensor groups and the intrinsic musculature has received little attention. There are few studies reporting on the biomechanical effects of metacarpal shortening. Low and colleagues evaluated the effect of apex dorsal angulation and shortening of cadaver index and little finger metacarpals on flexion and extension forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412461589">Low et al., 1995</xref>). Flexion force decreased and extension force increased as apex dorsal angulation increased and was significant beyond 30° of angulation. With shortening, both flexion and extension forces decreased and became significant beyond 3 mm of shortening. There was no difference between the index or little fingers, which were the only ones tested. Because it is a cadaveric study, it does not account for compensatory mechanisms that take place <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a follow-up study from the same group, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412461589">Pereira et al. (1998)</xref> investigated the extrinsic tendon forces needed to obtain full flexion and extension of the index finger in eight fresh “normal” cadaver hands that underwent increasing amounts of shortening and angulation of the metacarpal with fixed tendon excursion. The intact metacarpal served as the control and forces were calculated with increasing shortening and angular deformity and expressed as a percentage of the native finger. The force needed to extend the finger increased with increasing apex dorsal angulation and decreased with increasing bone shortening. The force needed to flex the finger decreased with both increased dorsal angulation and shortening. Apex dorsal angulation had a greater effect than shortening on both flexion and extension forces. The effect of fracture shortening on the extensor tendon mechanism in nine fresh-frozen cadaver hands was evaluated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412461589">Strauch et al. (1998)</xref> by performing shortening osteotomies of the index and little finger metacarpals. They found an average of 7° of extensor lag at the metacarpophalangeal joint for every 2 mm of metacarpal shortening. Clinically, the ability of the metacarpophalangeal joint to hyperextend may compensate for the interphalangeal joint extensor lag produced by metacarpal shortening. Additionally, they theorize about the effect of metacarpal shortening on the flexor tendon mechanism. As flexors would be relatively slackened, the expected effect would be reduced power.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412461589">Birndorf et al. (1997)</xref> evaluated the effect of increasing apex dorsal angulation at the little finger metacarpal neck on the flexor digitorum profundus mechanical efficiency in bringing the finger from full extension to full flexion. Twelve fresh frozen cadaver hands were used and ratios were calculated using the native hand as the denominator and allowing each hand to serve as its own control. They found a significant decay in flexor system efficiency when the angulation exceeded 30° with an increase in tendon excursion, load, and work requirements.</p>
<p>In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412461589">Meunier et al. (2004)</xref> investigated the effect of metacarpal shortening on the interosseous muscle function in nine cadaver hands. Interosseous muscles have a high fibre-to-muscle length ratio, indicating that they function optimally over a short range of lengths and thus they are theoretically more vulnerable to metacarpal shortening. The ring finger metacarpal was translated proximally in 2 mm increments in relation to a stationary middle finger metacarpal. Assuming a standard muscle length–tension relationship, a linear decrease in interosseous power with proximal translation of the metacarpal was found. At 2 mm, an 8% loss in power generation was measured by 10 mm, the muscle was measured to have only about 55% of its optimum power compared with its native position.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the effect of metacarpal shortening on finger flexion force. We designed a model to test this effect. The entire flexor tendon mechanism, consisting of the superficial flexor, the deep flexor, and the lumbrical systems are all relatively lengthened by the same distance following metacarpal shortening. This presumably reduces finger flexion force. We have confirmed this in a cadaveric model. Both increased shortening and increased digital flexion resulted in progressively greater losses of flexion force. In this model, shortening as little as 5 mm produced statistically significant losses.</p>
<p>This study is in agreement with prior studies evaluating metacarpal shortening. All have found that shortening produces a significant effect on hand function with involvement of the flexor, extensor, and interosseous systems. A shortcoming of cadaver studies is that the dynamic muscle–tendon unit rebalancing that occurs after injury cannot be evaluated and considered. The intermetacarpal ligaments may limit shortening even in cases with segmental bone loss. Thus, extrapolating the results of these studies for recommending clinical intervention requires careful consideration and further evaluation. Studying the middle or ring fingers may have been closer to <italic>in vivo</italic> circumstances, since the ring finger is more important for power grasp, but this model is technically easier to execute with a border digit. Clinical studies evaluating metacarpal fracture malunion and their relationship to pinch and grip strength would lend further insight into determining limits on metacarpal fracture shortening. However, the current study, as well as prior work, suggests that maintaining metacarpal length within 5 mm of normal is important.</p>

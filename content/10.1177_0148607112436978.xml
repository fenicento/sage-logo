<abstract>
<p>Use of acid-suppressive therapy (AST) to prevent stress gastropathy in the intensive care unit has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. The primary indications for such use of AST include need for mechanical ventilation, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, severe burn, and head trauma. Despite this limited list of indications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) often are overprescribed for purposes of stress prophylaxis. Decreased mucosal blood flow with subsequent tissue ischemia is thought to be the mechanism responsible for stress-induced gastropathy. Subsequent activation of inflammatory and vasoconstrictive mediators determines the severity of the gastropathy. Numerous basic science studies suggest that enteral nutrition (EN) can improve mucosal blood flow and reverse the generation of these inflammatory mediators. Clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of EN vs acid-suppressive medications, however, have shown variable results (and there are no randomized controlled trials to date). In hypersecretory states (such as head trauma and burns), AST should be given, even in patients who are tolerating EN. In the absence of a hypersecretory state, pharmacologic AST may be avoided or discontinued in patients who are tolerating EN. Stress prophylaxis medications also should be discontinued in patients who do not have a clear indication for their use. Overt bleeding in a patient receiving EN for stress prophylaxis should prompt the initiation of a PPI. Randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy of EN for stress ulcer prophylaxis are needed. Protocols should be developed to alert healthcare teams to consider discontinuation of AST, especially when tolerance of EN is achieved.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis is overused in the intensive care unit (ICU) based on existing data. Clear indications do exist for use of these agents, and such drugs should be used only in those circumstances. Clinicians need to be aware that enteral nutrition (EN) may provide effective stress ulcer prophylaxis for most patient populations in the ICU and may be an effective strategy that is grossly underused by intensivists. Incorporation of EN as a base strategy for stress ulcer prophylaxis may provide the patient and clinician with a number of additional unforeseen benefits, including a potential reduction in risk for <italic>Clostridia difficile</italic> pseudomembranous colitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia. EN may also provide more efficient allocation of healthcare resources and cost-containment due to reduced use of pharmacologic agents, in addition to the obvious benefit of greater adequacy of nutrition therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress-induced gastrointestinal bleeding remains a persistent and controversial clinical problem for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Which patients should be placed on acid-suppressive therapy (AST), using primarily proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor blockers (H<sub>2</sub>B) to prevent stress-induced gastropathy, remains debatable. Purported indications for AST in the ICU include placement on mechanical ventilation, coagulopathies, burns, head trauma, and acute hepatic failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112436978">1</xref></sup> Despite little evidence supporting AST use in non-ICU patients, the practice is common in hospitalized patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112436978">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112436978">3</xref></sup> Patients who are started on AST for stress prophylaxis are often continued on therapy when they are transferred out of the ICU and then discharged on these medications despite having no indication or condition requiring AST. The use of powerful AST medications in hospitalized patients has been linked to numerous adverse complications, including pneumonia, <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, osteoporotic hip fracture, and decreased bioavailability of medications such as clopidogrel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112436978">4</xref></sup> In addition to the increased risk of complications, there is a large cost burden to the healthcare system associated with AST. AST, specifically PPIs, account for a large proportion of pharmaceutical expenditures in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112436978">5</xref></sup> One of the top-grossing prescription medications in the United States is esomeprazole, earning an estimated $6 billion in U.S. sales in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112436978">6</xref></sup> ICU patients who receive early enteral nutrition (EN) may not necessarily require AST, as EN increases splanchnic blood flow and should prevent mucosal ischemia. Because the standard of care in the ICU includes early enteral feeding for critically ill patients, reductions in the need for AST may decrease complications and reduce cost of care. In this review, we discuss the disease burden and physiology of stress gastropathy and the protective effects of EN on the stomach during stress. We review the data supporting the use of EN as stress prophylaxis in the ICU and make recommendations for AST in patients who are receiving EN.</p>

<title>Disease Burden of Stress Gastropathy</title>
<p>Although overt bleeding occurs infrequently, stress gastropathy is common in ICU patients, with most patients having gross evidence of endoscopic mucosal damage within 3 days of admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112436978">1</xref></sup> The incidence of stress-related mucosal bleeding in the ICU varies in the literature, with older more retrospective studies reporting a higher incidence than more recent prospective studies. These more recent reports also suggest that the stress-induced mucosal damage may not be as clinically significant as previously thought, as most lesions heal quickly without serious sequelae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112436978">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A large prospective cohort study of 2252 ICU patients was performed to determine the risk factors for stress-related mucosal bleeding and the incidence of clinically important bleeding following admission to the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112436978">7</xref></sup> Patients were excluded if they had overt gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (hematemesis, gross blood per nasogastric tube, coffee-ground emesis, hematochezia, or melena) 48 hours prior to or within 24 hours of admission. Other exclusion criteria included previous gastrectomy, facial trauma, brain death, death within 24 hours, and preterminal prognosis. AST was discouraged except in patients who had head injuries, burns, overt GI bleeding 3 days to 6 weeks prior to admission, or endoscopic evidence of peptic ulcer disease in the preceding 6 weeks. Clinically important bleeding was defined as overt GI bleeding complicated by hemodynamic instability, based on preset criteria. The preset criteria were defined as one of the following within 24 hours after the onset of bleeding: a spontaneous decrease of more than 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, an increase of more than 20 beats per minute in heart rate or a decrease of more than 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure measured on sitting up, or a decrease in hemoglobin level of more than 2 g per deciliter and subsequent transfusion, after which hemoglobin did not increase by a value defined as the number of units transfused minus 2 g per deciliter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112436978">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the 2252 patients included in the study, 674 received AST, with the majority of these patients receiving H<sub>2</sub> blockers. Of those patients receiving AST, 27% had no clear indication or no indication listed. Of the 2252 patients, 100 (4.4%) had overt bleeding episodes, with 87% of these patients receiving AST. In the patients with overt bleeding, 33 had clinically important bleeding (1.5%), and 23 of these patients received AST. Of the 33 patients with clinically important bleeding, there were 16 deaths (0.71%). The authors performed multiple regression analysis to identify the risk factors for clinically important GI bleeding. The only independent risk factors identified were respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours and coagulopathy defined as platelet count less than 50,000 or international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5. The calculated odds ratio (OR) for these independent risk factors were 15.6 for respiratory failure and 4.3 for coagulopathy, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112436978">7</xref></sup> Of the 847 patients with either one of these risk factors, 31 had clinically significant bleeding (3.7%). By contrast, of those individuals without either of these risk factors, only 2 of 1405 (0.1%) had clinically significant bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112436978">7</xref></sup> Interestingly, by regression analysis, EN was also found to be a risk factor (OR = 3.8). However, when multiple regression was applied, the OR for enteral feeding causing clinically significant bleeding was reduced to 1.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112436978">7</xref></sup> Other potential independent factors that did not significantly increase risk that were not statistically significant independent risks included sepsis, liver failure, renal failure, and use of glucocorticoids. The study also highlights the problems with earlier retrospective analyses, which often led to an overestimation of the incidence of bleeding from stress gastropathy. The major conclusions from this study were the identification of 2 independent risk factors (mechanical ventilation and coagulopathy) and the fact that the incidence of clinically significant bleeding (at 1.5%) was much lower than previously suggested.</p>
<p>In a multicenter, prospective cohort study involving 874 patients, logistic analysis showed that anti–<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> immunoglobulin A concentrations, prolonged nasogastric intubation, alcoholism, and acute hepatic failure were independently correlated with the development of acute GI bleeding in an ICU setting. Of note, treatment with heparin, warfarin, and/or corticosteroids was shown not to be independently associated with acute GI bleeding in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112436978">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other studies have also shown that both respiratory failure and coagulopathy are associated with increased risk of GI bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112436978">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112436978"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112436978">11</xref></sup> The commonly accepted risk factors for clinically relevant stress gastropathy are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112436978">Table 1</xref>. Large prospective studies have indicated that severe head trauma, large area burns, mechanical ventilation, and coagulopathy are the only definitive indications for AST in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112436978">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112436978">7</xref></sup> Patients without these risk factors are unlikely to develop clinically important bleeding and should not receive AST.</p>

<title>Mechanism of Stress Gastropathy</title>
<p>Severe physiologic stress caused by processes such as mechanical ventilation, burns, and acute hepatic failure leads to several abnormalities of the proximal GI tract, including stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD), motility disturbances, and mucosal edema related to hypoalbuminemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112436978">12</xref></sup> Although gastric acid is essential to injury, the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to stress gastropathy center on splanchnic hypoperfusion and reperfusion injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112436978">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112436978">14</xref></sup> Local mechanisms (such as the mucosal microcirculation, continuous generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGI<sub>2</sub>, an alkaline tide, continuous cell renewal from mucosal progenitor cells, and mucus-bicarbonate-phospholipid barrier) protect the gastric mucosa from ulcerogenic and necrotizing agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112436978">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112436978">15</xref></sup> Disturbances in mucosal blood flow seen in severe physiologic stress lead to an attenuation of these natural mucosal defenses and, in the presence of acid, result in SRMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112436978">16</xref></sup></p>

<p>Several studies have demonstrated the presence, described the importance, and elucidated the mechanisms leading to ischemia/reperfusion injury of the proximal GI tract in critical illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112436978">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112436978"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112436978"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112436978"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112436978"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112436978">22</xref></sup> In a study of head trauma, those patients with endoscopic lesions were shown to have reduced gastric blood flow compared with similar patients without endoscopic evidence of SRMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112436978">21</xref></sup> Animal studies have demonstrated splanchnic hypoperfusion and resultant gastric mucosal injury that are dependent on the level of systemic hypotension, the amount of gastric acid secreted, and the degree of reperfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112436978">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112436978">18</xref></sup> Patients with severe sepsis and those patients placed on mechanical ventilation demonstrate significant reductions in gastroduodenal blood flow and subsequent increases in mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112436978">22</xref></sup> Numerous basic science studies have demonstrated that despite normalization of central hemodynamics following fluid resuscitation, there is a progressive vasoconstriction in the arterioles of the splanchnic circulation that may contribute to multiple-organ dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112436978">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112436978"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112436978"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112436978"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112436978">27</xref></sup> Finally, mechanical ventilation alone results in splanchnic hypoperfusion via decreased cardiac output, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, and a dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112436978">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although clinically apparent ischemia and reperfusion appear to drive the pathophysiology of SRMD, subsequent cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activation, endogenous nitric oxide (NO) and endothelian-1 production, and oxidative stress appear to play critical roles in the development and severity of SRMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112436978">1</xref></sup> These mechanisms are complex and remain poorly understood. An example of such complexity is the role of endogenous NO in SRMD. NO production has been demonstrated to be both protective and pro-ulcerogenic in mouse models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112436978">28</xref></sup> Although constitutive NO synthetase protects gastric mucosa by several mechanisms (eg, increased ghrelin production), inducible NO synthetase (iNOS) is induced by ischemia/reperfusion and leads to oxidative stress via NO-derived reactive compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112436978">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112436978">29</xref></sup> Similar to endogenous iNOS expression and subsequent deleterious NO production, endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictive peptide, is increased in SRMD and may play a role in mucosal ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112436978">30</xref></sup> Prostaglandins produced via the COX-2 pathway, on the other hand, have been demonstrated to play an important role in the protection and healing of gastric mucosa in SRMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112436978">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112436978">32</xref></sup> Ischemia/reperfusion and resultant hypoxia induce COX-2 expression. Attenuation of this mechanism has been shown to significantly affect the degree of injury and healing during the ischemic process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112436978">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Oxidative stress also appears to play a role in at least the reperfusion phase of SRMD. Animal studies have demonstrated a correlation between measures of oxidative stress (eg, activation of superoxide dismutase, decreased glutathione levels, and inactivation of gastric peroxidase) and the degree of mucosal damage resulting from cold-restraint stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112436978">33</xref></sup> Allopurinol, an inhibitor of the formation of superoxide radicals, has significantly attenuated gastric lesions produced by ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112436978">34</xref></sup> Lipid peroxidation has also been shown to be involved in SRMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112436978">35</xref></sup> Finally, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)–sensitive transcription factors (such as nuclear factor–κB [NF-κB]) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (such as p38 MAPK) may play key roles in the dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines thought to be essential in SRMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112436978">36</xref></sup></p>

<title>AST</title>
<p>A variety of agents have been used for prophylaxis against stress gastropathy, including antacids, sucralfate, misoprostol, H<sub>2</sub>Bs, and PPIs. H<sub>2</sub>Bs were the most effective agents in preventing clinically important bleeding prior to the introduction of the PPI omeprazole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112436978">37</xref></sup> Both intravenous (IV) cimetidine and omeprazole are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for AST for stress prophylaxis. Recent trends suggest that the rate of PPI use for AST in the ICU has increased and quite possibly has surpassed use of H<sub>2</sub>Bs. PPI use is costly, and there is evidence that they are inappropriately used in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>The inappropriate prescribing practices for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the inpatient hospital setting are well described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112436978">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112436978"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112436978">36</xref></sup> The clinical and financial burden associated with the inappropriate use of PPIs in the inpatient setting is staggering. What is becoming more prevalent is the continuation of PPIs despite a lack or resolution of risk factors for stress gastropathy. These medications are then often continued after discharge from the hospital. A chart review in 1997 of 123 patients admitted to the coronary care unit or the ICU found that 51% did not have a documented indication for AST. Of these patients, 43% were discharged home on oral AST medications without clear guidelines for duration of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607112436978">38</xref></sup> A subsequent chart review of general medical patients by Nardino et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607112436978">39</xref></sup> in 2000 showed that of 226 patients admitted to the hospital, 65% were inappropriately started on AST. Of these patients, 55% were discharged home on this therapy. A 2005 chart review found that of 324 patients admitted to a general medicine floor, 60% were inappropriately started on AST, with 34% of these patients continuing such medications upon discharge. PPIs accounted for 84% of cases using AST medications, H<sub>2</sub>Bs accounted for 15%, and 1% of patients were discharged on both medications. These patients were followed up for 6 months. At 3 months following discharge, 80% of patients continued these medications, and at 6 months, 50% of patients continued these medications despite appropriate follow-up with their primary care physician.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607112436978">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recent chart reviews have shown an improvement in appropriate use of stress ulcer prophylaxis. A 2006 chart review showed that of 1769 patients admitted over a 4-month period, only 22.1% were inappropriately started on stress ulcer prophylaxis. However, of the patients inappropriately initiated on stress ulcer prophylaxis, 54% were discharged home on these medications, illustrating an ongoing tendency for unjustified prescribing practices. Of the agents used for AST in this study, an overwhelming 89.4% of cases involved pantoprazole (a PPI), whereas ranitidine (an H<sub>2</sub>B) accounted for only 8.3%. On the basis of this information, an analysis was performed on the cost of inappropriate use of AST. The study found that the inpatient cost of therapy totaled $11,024, whereas the outpatient cost of therapy totaled $16,924 over the 4-month period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607112436978">41</xref></sup> Extrapolating the cost totals from these studies over an annual time period across the entire United States provides some indication of the overwhelming allocation of resources that might occur from inappropriate and unjustified prescribing practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607112436978">41</xref></sup> These studies illustrate not only the overuse of AST in both the ICUs and general medicine wards but also the inappropriate continuation of medications upon discharge. The implementation of EN for stress ulcer prophylaxis would help limit the continuation of AST from the ICU to the ward to the outpatient setting, thereby limiting cost while avoiding the potential side effects of chronic AST.</p>

<title>Protective Effects of EN</title>
<p>The pathophysiology of stress gastropathy involves decreased gastric blood flow and mucosal ischemia. Subsequent alterations in mucosal integrity then facilitate acid injury and bleeding. EN has been shown to prevent mucosal ischemia through its effect on splanchnic blood flow, and thus it may be considered for use as a stress ulcer prophylaxis agent. Numerous basic science studies have examined the effect of EN on gastric and small intestinal blood flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112436978">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0148607112436978">77</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0148607112436978"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0148607112436978"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0148607112436978">80</xref></sup> The first of these studies examined the acute effects (2 hours postgavage) of either a control diet (Boost; Nestlé Health Science, Vevey, Switzerland) or an immune-enhancing diet (Impact; Nestlé Health Science) on whole-organ blood flow in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0148607112436978">77</xref></sup> The authors demonstrated that both Boost and Impact caused a significant increase in blood flow to the antrum and duodenum at 30 minutes postgavage (compared with the baseline values).

<p>A randomized controlled trial in burn patients examined the effects of L-arginine supplementation on gastric blood flow, oxygenation, and serum NO content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0148607112436978">81</xref></sup> A total of 47 patients with burns greater than 50% total body surface area were admitted to the ICU and randomized to receive early EN (within 12 hours) with varying amounts of L-arginine or EN with no supplemental L-arginine. Patients who received the L-arginine supplementation had lower amounts of NO in the serum at 72 hours than the other groups. L-arginine supplementation increased gastric blood flow and improved oxygenation compared with control groups. There were no significant differences in mean arterial blood pressure in any of the groups. These results suggest that EN, specifically L-arginine supplementation, improves gastric blood flow and oxygenation while reducing circulating inducible NO, all of which would potentially reverse the consequences of stress gastropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0148607112436978">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a result of decreased blood flow to the stomach during stress, the integrity of the mucosal wall may be compromised, allowing for acid contact with the submucosa and risk for clinically significant bleeding. EN formulas are typically alkaline, with a pH ranging from 5.5–7.0. The effects of EN on intragastric pH in the ICU have been variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0148607112436978">82</xref></sup> A study of 95 patients with ICU stays longer than 5 days were prospectively studied using variable strategies including intragastric EN and AST for stress ulcer prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0148607112436978">83</xref></sup> Results demonstrated that gastric pH was independently increased by both intragastric EN (OR, 4.54) and AST (OR, 2.04), suggesting that EN could increase gastric pH presumably via its alkaline nature.

Although results overall from numerous small retrospective studies that evaluated EN as a possible strategy for stress prophylaxis have been conflicting, a few have shown benefit in preventing significant GI bleeding in different patient populations.</p>
<p>One of the first studies to show that EN may offer a protective benefit from significant GI bleeding was done in the early 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0148607112436978">95</xref></sup> In this retrospective single-center study, ICU patients on mechanical ventilation who were receiving EN were compared with patients receiving antacids or cimetidine (an H<sub>2</sub>B). Three treatment categories were identified: (1) prophylactic antacids, (2) prophylactic cimetidine (H<sub>2</sub>B), and (3) EN without AST. A total of 43 patients met criteria for admission into the study (n = 20 antacids, n = 9 cimetidine, n = 14 EN). GI bleeding was defined as a positive guaiac hematest on 3 consecutive nasogastric aspirates, frankly bloody nasogastric aspirate, hematemesis, or melena. There were no significant differences in ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, or duration of mechanical ventilation between the 3 groups. However, the rates of significant GI bleeding were different. Patients receiving the H<sub>2</sub>B cimetidine had an incidence of significant GI bleeding of 77.7%, whereas those receiving antacids had an incidence of 70.0%. No bleeding occurred in 14 patients receiving EN.</p>
<p>From 1971–1976, a group undertook a prospective trial of antacid therapy with or without EN in burn patients and followed “clinically evident” Curling ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0148607112436978">96</xref></sup> A clinically evident Curling ulcer was defined as upper GI bleeding that resulted in a 2-g/dL drop in hemoglobin, resulted in a need for transfusion, or led to perforation of the upper GI tract. Patients with greater than 40% surface area burn, admitted within 24 hours of the burn and who were “potentially salvageable,” were entered into the study (n = 109). During the first 3 years of the open protocol, patients were divided into 3 treatment groups by subjective risk: (1) severely burned patients with poor prognosis anticipated to develop Curling ulcers were placed on antacids hourly until autografting was complete; (2) severely burned patients with a better prognosis, at lower risk for Curling ulcer, were given EN at 3000 kcal/d; and (3) indeterminate patients were placed on antacids early postburn and later switched to EN until autografting was complete. After the third year, the protocol was simplified so that all patients were given the third combination regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0148607112436978">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relative to prior studies, the group achieved improved outcomes with a dramatic reduction in the incidence of clinically evident Curling ulcers. Of the 109 “potentially salvageable” patients, only 3 had clinically evident Curling ulcer. All 3 of these patients received the combination of antacid followed by the EN formula. The occurrence of clinically evident Curling ulcer in only 3 patients was less than the anticipated number of 14 in the “potentially salvageable” group based on percentages from prior studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0148607112436978">96</xref></sup></p>

For the subsequent 2 years, the protocol changed and 273 patients were treated with early EN only for stress prophylaxis. In this study, an upper GI bleed was defined as blood present on aspiration via nasogastric tube, gross hematemesis, or melena. A clinically significant bleed was defined as having in addition either a fall in hemoglobin of more than 3 g/dL, clinical shock, the need for blood transfusion, or requirement for operative intervention. The AST group had 23 total bleeds in 21 of 253 patients (6 with serious hemorrhage occurring in 5 patients, 17 defined as minor events in 16 patients). In the EN group, there was a statistically significant reduction in the number of patients with GI bleeding. In 273 EN patients, 9 events occurred (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), with 7 events being a minor bleed and 2 events being a serious GI hemorrhage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0148607112436978">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>A subsequent retrospective study in patients anticipated to stay in the ICU more than 72 hours compared different prophylaxis regimens and outcomes with respect to GI bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0148607112436978">98</xref></sup> Bleeding was defined as gross blood present in the gastric aspirate, hematemesis, or melena. In one group, antacids were administered to patients until a goal gastric aspirate pH of greater than 3.5 was reached (n = 186). In a second group where the goal pH was not reached by antacids alone, cimetidine was added for combination therapy (n = 28). In a third group where there was a contraindication to antacids, patients received cimetidine alone (n = 66). And in a fourth group, AST was discontinued when they were started on EN (n = 18).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0148607112436978">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>Seven risk factors for GI bleeding, determined at admission, included acute respiratory failure, shock, acute cardiac failure or arrhythmias, major surgery in the previous 72 hours, acute renal failure, coma, and sepsis. At baseline comparison, there was no significant difference between groups with regard to number of risk factors for bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0148607112436978">98</xref></sup> Results showed evidence of GI bleeding in 10 of 186 (5%) antacid-only, 10 of 66 (15%) cimetidine-only, 7 of 28 antacid and cimetidine (25%), and 10 of 18 (56%) EN patient groups. All bleeders in the EN group had 2 or more risk factors at the time of their bleed. The authors cautioned against using EN as the only source of stress prophylaxis in the presence of 2 or more risk factors for bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0148607112436978">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>In some studies, EN not the primary focus of the investigation, but a close analysis of the data indicates EN may have served as an effective stress prophylaxis agent. In a retrospective analysis of medical ICU stress prophylaxis over 4 years, the use of AST decreased from 71% to 21%. The rate of EN utilization during this same period increased from 51.1% to 79.1%. Importantly, the incidence of endoscopically proven stress-related ulceration remained unchanged despite significantly fewer patients receiving pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0148607112436978">99</xref></sup> A later prospective study by the same group determined that instituting a stress ulcer prophylaxis protocol reduced AST from 70% to 26%, whereas the rates of major GI bleeding were equivocal. Although the authors did not report the percentage of patients receiving EN, the use of EN was an indication for AST discontinuation in the protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0148607112436978">100</xref></sup> Taken together, these studies indicate the possible role of using EN in place of AST for stress prophylaxis without the risk of increased GI bleeding.</p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis reviewed 56 randomized controlled studies comparing H<sub>2</sub>B with placebo, 3 of which also provided patients with adequate EN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0148607112436978">101</xref></sup> Primary end points were incidence of clinically significant bleeding as defined by the study authors or use of endoscopy. Secondary end points were HAP and mortality. Of the 56 studies analyzed, 17 met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0148607112436978">101</xref></sup> In all patients, both with or without EN, H<sub>2</sub>B reduced bleeding risk (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.76; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .002). Three studies with adequate EN in the control group vs adequate EN with H<sub>2</sub>B showed no effect on the risk of GI bleeding but favored the use of EN alone (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.43–3.7). By itself, H<sub>2</sub>B therapy had no impact on mortality (OR, 1.03). However, in patients with EN alone compared with EN with H<sub>2</sub>B, there was a higher mortality in the dual-treatment group compared with the control group (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.04–3.44; <italic>P</italic> = .04).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0148607112436978">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0148607112436978">103</xref></sup> The incidence of HAP was reported in 9 studies, 2 of which provided adequate EN without H<sub>2</sub>B therapy. Analysis of all 9 studies together showed patients on H<sub>2</sub>B therapy had no increased risk of HAP (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.89–2.61; <italic>P</italic> = .12). However, in the 2 studies where EN was used in the control group vs H<sub>2</sub>B combined with EN, there was increased risk of HAP in patients receiving both treatments (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.20–6.56, <italic>P</italic> = .02). The authors’ conclusions were that in patients with adequate EN, additional stress ulcer prophylaxis with AST is not compulsory to reduce the risk of GI bleeding. In fact, adding AST when a patient is tolerating EN may increase the risk of HAP and mortality. Despite this meta-analysis and the prior studies, no randomized controlled trial has ever compared EN (alone as stress ulcer prophylaxis) with AST.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0148607112436978">101</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A number of small human trials and several animal studies indicate that EN provides protection against stress gastropathy. An adequately powered, randomized study is needed to evaluate the efficacy of EN vs AST for stress ulcer prophylaxis. In the absence of a hypersecretory state such as burns or head injury, EN may provide adequate stress prophylaxis, and AST may not be required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112436978">Figure 2</xref>). There does not appear to be a difference between intragastric vs postpyloric EN with regard to clinically significant stress ulcer prophylaxis. AST should be used in the setting of such hypersecretory states, even in patients who are tolerating EN. If overt bleeding should occur in a patient receiving EN for stress prophylaxis, a PPI should be given. Physicians should be aware of the growing body of literature demonstrating an association between AST and adverse side effects such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, and <italic>C difficile</italic>–associated diarrhea. An overuse of AST results from 2 clinical scenarios, one where stress prophylaxis is not clearly indicated and the other where appropriate therapy is continued after discharge from the ICU for inappropriate reasons. When these factors are taken into consideration, the cost of AST becomes excessive, contributing adversely to the burden of allocation of healthcare resources. For these reasons, protocols should be developed to alert healthcare teams to use AST only when indicated and consider discontinuation when appropriate, especially once EN tolerance is achieved. Clearly further research in the form of randomized controlled trials is needed on this important topic.</p>

<caption><p>Algorithm for acid-suppressive therapy (AST) use in critical illness. Severe head trauma, large area burns, mechanical ventilation, and coagulopathy are the only definitive indications for AST in the intensive care unit (ICU). Discontinuation of AST should be considered in mechanical ventilation and coagulopathy once enteral nutrition is being tolerated. AST should be continued throughout ICU care in patients with hypersecretory states such as severe head trauma and large area burns. In all patients, AST should be discontinued once the indication for it has resolved. EN, enteral nutrition.</p></caption>

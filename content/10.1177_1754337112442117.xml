<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to construct a finite element model of a golf ball and an impact simulation model between the ball and a club, and to devise a method for the construction of simulation models by investigating the factors affecting the behaviour of the ball during and after impact. A ball model with hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity was constructed using solid elements, and the relationship between the material properties and the ball behaviour at impact was revealed by varying several material constants of the ball model. A finite element model of a club with elasticity was created from a computer-aided design surface model of a commercially available driver. The club head and shaft were modelled using solid and shell elements, respectively. The effects of initial conditions at impact on the rebound behaviour of the ball, that is, the velocity, angle and spin rate, were investigated from impact simulations by varying the impact points of the ball and the postures of the club. Then, methods for the construction of simulation models were proposed based on these relationships. Impact experiments were also conducted to obtain the ball behaviour. The results simulated using the models, constructed by the proposed methods, closely matched the experimental results.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Golf equipment has been changed by the application of innovative technologies over the last 30 years. The construction and performance of driver heads (number 1 wood), in particular, have strongly been influenced by the use of titanium alloys, which have a good strength-to-weight ratio. The introduction of titanium allows the head to be designed to have a larger and thinner impact face and larger volume. Flexing the large, thin face of a driver head provides kinetic energy to the ball after impact by reducing its deformation and the associated viscoelastic energy loss during impact between the clubhead and the ball. As a result, the effect gives a higher coefficient of restitution (CoR) to the driver. Driver heads with a higher CoR and larger volume have contributed to increases in ball driving distance and improvements in ball trajectory.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that advanced technology has taken the skill out of playing and enabled players to lower their score easily, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the United States Golf Association have placed an upper limit for driver CoR. Furthermore, the upper limits for the volume and moment of inertia (MoI), as well as CoR, for driver heads are included in the current rules. Thus, the development of golf equipment has become closely involved with regulations.</p>
<p>The initiation of regulations was a turning point in the development of driver heads, and the following direction has become increasingly important in the design of higher performance clubs which meet the rules. The current design and development of clubs has so far focused mainly on the launch conditions of the ball after impact, most notably the launch angle, spin rate, and launch velocity. The launch conditions depend on the interactions between the mechanical properties of the clubhead and those of the ball. It is, therefore, important to understand precisely which clubhead properties affect the behaviour of the ball during and after impact.</p>
<p>The finite element (FE) method is among the most effective ways to meet these requirements of the golf impact problem. FE modelling for impact is also expected to be useful to understand the impact mechanism in detail and to efficiently develop high performing equipment using a wealth of information on the dynamic behaviour, such as impact force and ball deformation, which is neither simply nor easily obtainable by experiment. Due to several advantages of FE analysis (FEA), this modelling has been widely used to replicate the dynamic behaviour of other sports balls, such as a tennis ball<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337112442117">1</xref></sup> and a hockey ball.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337112442117">2</xref></sup> Thus, FE models for a golf impact, which can precisely simulate impact behaviour, are also required for aiding in the designing of equipment with increased performance.</p>
<p>There have been studies in the past which have treated the golf impact problem using FE models. Early studies utilised simple models, such as a two-dimensional FE model, to identify the CoR and spin rate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337112442117">3</xref></sup> and a ball model consisting of elastic solid elements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337112442117">4</xref></sup> to investigate influences of mechanical properties of the clubhead on the rebound behaviour of the ball after impact. Three-dimensional models with viscosity properties were developed to demonstrate the benefits of two-piece and multilayer construction balls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337112442117">5</xref></sup> Also, effects of the mechanical properties of the ball on the mechanics of the ball impact have been investigated using FE ball models, which were given the characteristics of a hyperelastic material and a linear elastic material,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337112442117">6</xref></sup> and those of hyperelastic and viscoelastic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337112442117">7</xref></sup> These previous studies propose that more precise and sophisticated ball modelling, such as a finer meshing of the FE model and more accurate material properties, are necessary to simulate the actual behaviour of the ball. Additionally, studies using detailed FE models were conducted to examine the effects of different clubhead designs on the rebound behaviour of balls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754337112442117">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337112442117">9</xref></sup> The studies suggest that more experiments are required to construct finer models and to enhance the reliability of the results obtained from their simulations.</p>
<p>These situations lead to a high requirement for making it possible to build an accurate FE impact model in as short a time as possible in order to design high-performance clubs following the availability of newly developed balls. We have worked on constructing FE models for a golf impact which can precisely express the impact behaviour, in particular, the rebound angle and the spin rate as well as the rebound velocity of the ball, and on developing a method for creating FE models.</p>
<p>This article describes the construction of the simulation models: (1) an FE model of a golf ball; and (2) an impact model between the developed ball model and an FE model of a club. First, the FE model of a three-piece ball with both hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity was constructed, and the process for constructing the model was devised by investigating the relationship between the material properties of the ball model and the impact behaviour of the ball. Second, an impact model was developed, and a method for constructing the model was proposed based on the influence of initial conditions at impact on the rebound behaviour of the ball. Then, impact experiments were also conducted to obtain the behaviour of the ball and club at a typical golf impact and to validate the accuracy of simulation models. Finally, using the proposed method, the simulation results, which were obtained from the identified model to be able to express impact behaviour measured from experiments, were shown.</p>

<title>Impact experiments between ball and targets</title>
<p>Two kinds of impact experiments were conducted: (1) collisions of a ball with steel targets; and (2) collisions of a ball with a club under a typical range of golf impact speed. Results obtained from these experiments were used for the validation of constructed FE models of the ball and club.</p>

<title>Collisions with steel targets</title>
<p>Impact experiments were conducted to obtain the dynamic properties of the golf ball, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337112442117">Figure 1</xref>. A three-piece ball was fired from an air gun, under strain-free and non-rotational conditions, and collided with steel targets: a circular bar and a thick flat plate. The target bar, which had a length of 1.80 m and a diameter of 0.03 m, was used for the normal impact tests, and the ball collided with the end surface of the target. The fixed target plate was used for the oblique impact tests, and the impact angle between the incidence of the ball and the target was changed by varying the angle at which the plate was set up on the ground. The impact velocities of the ball were varied at 25, 35 and 45 m/s. The oblique tests were conducted at the impact angles of 10°, 20° and 30° in consideration of the range of the loft angle of commercially available clubs. Five trials were performed for each of the experimental conditions.</p>

<p>The impact load histories, ball outer diameter deformation histories, and ball velocities of incidence (<italic>V</italic><sub>in</sub>) and rebound (<italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>) were obtained from the measured data for the normal impact tests. The velocities (<italic>V</italic><sub>in</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>), and rebound angle (α) and ball spin (ω) after impact were obtained from the measured data for the oblique tests. The impact load for the normal test was obtained from the time responses of the strain gauge affixed to the steel circular bar based on the one-dimensional theory of wave propagation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754337112442117">10</xref></sup> The behaviour of the ball incident on, and reflected off, the target was recorded using a high-speed video camera (MEMRECAMfx K4, nac Image Technology), which was synchronised with a data acquisition device for the strain using the signal detected when the ball passed through the laser sensor placed before impact. The deformation and the movement (<italic>V</italic><sub>in</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>, α and ω) of the ball were ascertained from images, which were tracked at a frame rate of 20,000 frames/s and a shutter speed of 10<sup>−5</sup> s. The deformation was calculated as the decrease in ball diameter during impact, that is, the difference between the diameter and the distance from the target surface to the point farthest from it on the circumference of the ball. Velocities were calculated using the position of the ball’s centre against time. The rebound angle was calculated as the angle between post-impact ball velocity and the horizontal. The ball spin was calculated by assessing the time taken for a rotation of the vector joining dot markers added to the ball’s surface. A positive value of spin (only positive post-impact spin values were recorded in this study) corresponds to backspin. This analysis only gave a spin value and simple direction (topspin and backspin), not spin-axis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1754337112442117">Table 1</xref> shows the ball rebound behaviour for the experiment of an oblique impact at a velocity of 35 m/s, as an example of the results.</p>

<title>Collisions with a golf club</title>
<p>An experiment was conducted in order to produce a typical impact between a ball and a club and to measure the behaviour of the club and ball during and after impact. The ball was fired from an air gun and collided with the face of a club, of which the grip of club was immobilised at the lie angle of the clubhead. The club consisted of a commercially available driver head and a steel shaft. The head was made from titanium alloy (Ti–Al6V4) and had a mass of 197.7 g and a volume of 458 cm<sup>3</sup>. A steel (Ni–Cr–Mo steel) shaft, which had a mass of 104.5 g and a length of 1100 mm, was used, as its mechanical properties could be measured experimentally and determined precisely for the construction of an FE model.</p>
<p>The behaviour of the ball and club were recorded using a high-speed video camera, and the rebound behaviour of the ball was ascertained in the same way as in the above-mentioned experiments. The impact velocities of the ball varied between 30, 40 and 50 m/s. Five trials were performed for each of the experimental conditions. The impact position was at the sweet spot (SS) of the clubhead. The SS is the location on the clubface in which the energy transfer during impact is most efficient, and it is also geometrically defined as the foot of a perpendicular drop from the centre of gravity (CoG) of the clubhead to the clubface. It is, however, difficult to obtain its position directly and precisely from a real clubhead, because the geometry of the clubface in general has a curved surface shape. Thus, it was found by comparing the results of <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> with changes in the impact point of the ball relative to the clubface. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1754337112442117">Table 2</xref> shows the experimental results of the rebound behaviour from collisions of the ball with the club.</p>

<title>Description of FE ball model</title>
<p>An FE model of a three-piece ball, which consisted of an outer cover, a mantle layer and a core, was constructed using eight-node solid elements, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337112442117">Figure 2</xref>. The outer diameters of the individual layers of the ball model were determined by measuring those of a real ball, which was used in the impact experiments. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1754337112442117">Table 3</xref> shows the outer diameters of the individual sections and the numbers of the nodes and elements for the ball model. In this model, modifying the mesh, that is, the size and shape of elements was put above introducing a higher-order element as a means for meshing which affected the accuracy of the simulation results, in order to avoid increasing the computational load due to the use of a higher-order element in a nonlinear dynamical analysis.</p>

<p>The material model of the cover, which was made of ionomer resin, is expressed as a hyperelastic model, whereas the material models of the core and mantle, which were made of polybutadiene rubber, are expressed as a viscoelastic model with hyperelasticity. In this study, the Mooney–Rivlin model was used for the hyperelastic model to represent material nonlinearity, such as a rubber material, and a three-element model was used for the viscoelastic model. In this study, the commercial FE code LS-DYNA (ver. 971, Livermore Software Technology Corporation) was used for the simulations.</p>

<p>It is necessary to determine the material constants making up the hyperelastic and viscoelastic models in order to express the material models for each section of the ball. Also, for identification of the constants, it is necessary to grasp effects of the constants on the ball behaviour at impact, because they are neither simply nor easily obtainable by experimental methods. Therefore, impact simulations were conducted to investigate the effects by varying the individual constants which composed the material models of the ball.</p>
<p>Rebound behaviour was analysed from normal and oblique impact simulations against a rigid target at a ball velocity of 35 m/s using the ball model. The impact load histories, deformation of the ball histories and <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> were obtained from the normal impact simulations, while the results of <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>, α and ω were obtained from the oblique impact simulations at an angle of incidence of 20°. In addition, friction between the ball and the impact face was expressed as Coulomb friction, and the friction coefficient was found to be 0.3 from a range of values measured by previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754337112442117">12</xref></sup> by investigating effects of the coefficient on the ball rebound behaviour.</p>

The results indicate that the impact load is significantly affected by the value of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> of the core. The most notable effects of altering <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> are that the maximum load tends to increase with the <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> of the core, and the time to reach its maximum value tends to decrease with increasing <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub>. The deformation history also tended to be strongly influenced by the value of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> of the core in the same way, as results for impact load and maximum deformation tended to decrease as <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> increased. On the other hand, the values of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> of the mantle and cover tend to have a small effect on the load histories (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337112442117">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Effects of viscoelasticity</title>
<p>Impact simulations were performed by applying a viscoelastic model to the core and mantle in order to investigate the effects of viscoelasticity on the behaviour of the ball. The three-element model is expressed as the standard linear solid model, which combines the Maxwell model (material parameters, <italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub> and β<sub>1</sub>) and a spring (material parameters, <italic>G</italic> and <italic>SIGF</italic>) in parallel. The function for representing stress relaxation, due to the viscous effect, is defined as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1754337112442117">equation (4)</xref> using the Prony series, and this is characterised in the input by the shear modulus, <italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub>, and decay constant, β<sub>1</sub>. The value of <italic>G</italic> should be 250–1000 times greater than <italic>SIGF</italic> in LS-DYNA, and the values of <italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>G</italic> are estimated by determining the values of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> and the relation between <italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>G</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1754337112442117">equation (5)</xref>. In this study, the value of <italic>G</italic> was 500 times greater than <italic>SIGF</italic>, and that of <italic>G</italic> was 0.4–1 times smaller than <italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub>. The viscoelastic model was expressed by estimating the values of <italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>G</italic> and <italic>SIGF</italic> from that of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub>, and by inputting that of β<sub>1</sub> directly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337112442117">Figure 5</xref> shows the effects of changing β<sub>1</sub> for the core (in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1754337112442117">Table 4</xref>) on the impact load histories, deformation histories and <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> for the normal impact simulations, with the viscoelastic constants of the mantle and the hyperelastic parameters for each section kept constant (values in parentheses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1754337112442117">Table 4</xref>). The time to reach the maximum impact load tends to increase with the β<sub>1</sub> of the core, and its maximum value is slightly affected by the value of β<sub>1</sub>, unlike the significant differences observed in the results of changing <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> for the hyperelastic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337112442117">Figure 3</xref>). The deformation history, in particular, during unloading, is affected by the value of β<sub>1</sub>, and the maximum deformation and the deformation history during unloading tends to increase with that of β<sub>1</sub>. The results of <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> are also influenced by the value of β<sub>1</sub> and tend to increase with that of β<sub>1</sub>. Moreover, the other viscoelastic constants of the core also had an effect on the same behaviour of the ball, that is, the impact load, deformation history and <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>. Meanwhile, the effects of parameters for the mantle on the ball behaviour also denoted the same trend of those of the core, although those of the mantle were smaller than those of the core. Thus, the material model with visco-elasticity can express the energy dissipation due to a collision, and the results depend mainly on the viscoelastic properties of the core.</p>

<title>Process developed for construction of material model</title>
<p>A method for constructing the material model of the ball is proposed based on the relationships between the material constants and the behaviour of the ball. The material constants which make up the hyperelastic and viscoelastic models are determined by making a comparison of the results between the simulation and the experiment for the same impact conditions.</p>
<p>First, the normal impact simulations are conducted. The value of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> of the core is determined by focusing on the histories of the impact load and ball deformation, in particular, during loading. The viscoelastic parameters of the core are determined by focusing on the time to reach the maximum impact load, the maximum deformation, the deformation history during unloading and the result of <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>. Second, the oblique impact simulations are conducted. The value of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> of the cover is determined by focusing on the results of α and ω. Finally, the values of <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> and viscoelastic parameters of the mantle layer are adjusted so that the simulation results for rebound behaviour are closer to the results of the experiment.</p>

The simulation results for <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> closely match the experimental results, and the simulated results of α and ω also agree with the experimental results, in their tendency to increase with impact angle. However, the simulated and experimental results for α and ω do not quantitatively match as closely as those for <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> in all impact angles and, in particular, the results at the impact angle of 30° tend to be less-accurate than those of other angles. This trend suggests that the model cannot accurately express the impact behaviour at a high impact angle. It is estimated that the impact at higher angles leads to the ball sliding and rolling on the target surface in addition to ball deformation during impact, and that this complicated interaction depends on a frictional behaviour between the ball and the impact face and a deformation behaviour of the ball during impact.</p>

</fig>
<p>The constructed model is thought not to be able to represent the complicated behaviour at higher angles with sufficient accuracy. One possible reason for this low accuracy may be that friction characteristics are described only by one coefficient under all impact conditions. Therefore, one of the solutions to improve this may be for frictional characteristics to be expressed in more detail, such as using a time history of a friction coefficient during impact instead of the constant value in the current model. However, to accurately construct an alternative contact condition between the ball and the target will be challenging. In addition, the material properties identified by the proposed method are not a unique solution, but one result of the combination of material constants which can express the ball behaviour. The values of the constructed model (in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1754337112442117">Table 5</xref>) were determined with particular emphasis on the accuracy of the rebound velocity and energy dissipation rather than that of the spin, in view of requiring a precise estimation of the CoR due to a setting of its upper limit in the current rules. Thus, different combinations of values of material constants also could be obtained focusing on the accuracy of other behaviour within a range of material properties which an elastomer could have. The combinations may have the potential to improve the accuracy of the spin rate while minimising the reduction of the rebound velocity. As seen from the above, it is considered to be necessary to explore the possibility of refinements in the friction condition and material constants for the simulations according to the accuracy required from the model.</p>
<p>To summarise the accuracy of the indentified model, the simulation results generally match the experimental results for a standard golf impact. It can be said, therefore, that the model constructed by the proposed method can express the behaviour of the ball for a range of impact angles from 0° to 20°.</p>

The material model of the head was expressed as a linear elasticity. The material properties, Young’s modulus, Possion’s ratio and density, were 115 GPa, 0.3 and 4500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively.

<title>Simulations of a ball colliding with a club</title>
<p>Initial conditions, that is, the impact point of the ball relative to the clubface and the posture of the club relative to the ball, must be decided in order to accurately produce impacts using FE models under the same conditions as those of the experiments.</p>
<p>Using the SS of the clubhead is suitable for adjusting the initial conditions. It is, however, difficult to obtain its position precisely from the clubhead model for the same reason noted above in the impact experiment against the club, and thus it is hard to identify the conditions using the position of the SS. In the simulations, therefore, the initial conditions were determined using the position of the CoG, which could be precisely evaluated from the model, and the relative position between the clubhead and the ball, which could be identified using the photograph taken by the high-speed video camera in the impact experiment, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337112442117">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<p>It is necessary to grasp the effects of the initial conditions on the post-impact launch conditions for the ball to develop a procedure for constructing the impact model. Therefore, impact simulations were carried out using the constructed FE models by varying the impact points on the clubface and the postures of the club, respectively. Then, a process for adjusting the initial conditions was proposed based on the trends found from the simulations with different conditions.</p>

<title>Effects of the initial conditions on rebound behaviour of a ball</title>
<p>Rebound behaviour of the ball was analysed from the FEAs of the collision between the ball and the club by varying the club impact points and the postures of the club, that is, the impact angle between the incidence of the ball and the clubface, respectively. These simulations were performed at a ball velocity of 40 m/s.</p>
<p>The impact point varied from the sole to the crown of the impact face. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1754337112442117">Figure 10</xref> shows the results of the rebound behaviour from the FEAs with different club impact points. In these figures, the horizontal axis represents the distance between the CoG of the clubhead and the centre of the ball along the <italic>y</italic>-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337112442117">Figure 9</xref>. ‘0’ indicates that the coordinate value of the <italic>y</italic>-axis for the CoG is equal to that of the ball centre, while positive and negative values mean that the impact points are situated on the crown and sole rather than the CoG, respectively. Then, the impact angle was varied by rotating the club around the axis parallel to the <italic>x</italic>-axis through the CoG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337112442117">Figure 9</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1754337112442117">Figure 11</xref> shows the results of the rebound behaviour from the FEAs with different impact angles.</p>

<p>The results of <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> remain approximately constant, regardless of any variations in the impact points and angles. This indicates that the result of <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> is more greatly affected by the geometry of the driver head, such as volume or MoI. The results of α and ω, in contrast, depend on the initial conditions, and tend to vary linearly with changes in both the impact points and impact angles. The value of α tends to increase by 0.6° mm<sup>−1</sup>, and that of ω tends to decrease by 60 r/min mm<sup>−1</sup>, when the impact point varied from the sole to the crown of the clubface, whereas the values of α and ω tend to increase by 2° and 200 r/min per degree, respectively, with the impact angle.</p>

<title>Process for construction of impact model</title>
<p>A method for constructing an impact model is proposed based on the trends of the change and its magnitude of rebound behaviour with initial conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337112442117">Figure 9</xref>. The initial conditions are determined by comparing the results of the FEAs to those from experiments under the same conditions.</p>
<p>First, the straight line connecting the CoG and the ball centre is set parallel to the <italic>yz</italic> plane, and the club model is rotated around the axis parallel to the <italic>y</italic>-axis through the CoG so that the angles of incidence and rebound of the ball are parallel to the <italic>yz</italic> plane. Second, in the <italic>yz</italic> plane, the positions of the sole and hosel of the head model are compared with those of the head in the photograph, and the model is rotated around the <italic>x</italic>-and <italic>z</italic>-axes so that the positions of the model agree with those of the photograph. Finally, the position of the ball along the <italic>y</italic>-axis is determined by comparing the positions of the clubhead and ball between the model and the photograph.</p>

<title>Validation of the accuracy of impact model</title>
<p>The simulated rebound behaviour of the ball were analysed using the impact model constructed based on the proposed process, and the accuracy of the model was confirmed by comparing the results of the FEAs to those of experiments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1754337112442117">Figure 12</xref> shows the results for <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>, α and ω for both the experiment and the FEAs. The simulation results for <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub> closely match the experimental results for a range of impact velocities. The simulation results for α and ω agree qualitatively well with the experimental results, although the simulated and experimental results for α and ω do not quantitatively match as closely as do those for <italic>V</italic><sub>out</sub>. These trends indicate that the simulation results of rebound behaviour from the constructed impact model cannot be expected to obtain any more quantitative accuracy than those from previous ball models. In other words, it turns out that the impact model is constructed to allow for the precise estimation of the impact behaviour between the ball and club, except for the aforementioned factors leading to low accuracy. This suggests the possibility that the quantitative accuracy of the impact model may be increased with an increase in that of the ball model.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>An FE model of a golf ball with both hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity was constructed. The process for constructing the model was developed on the basis of the relationship between the material properties and the behaviour of the ball during impact, which was revealed by the results simulated with changes in several material constants for the ball model. The results show that hyperelasticity of the core significantly affects the behaviour of the impact load and the ball deformation for a normal impact, whereas hyperelasticity of the core and cover affect the rebound angle and spin rate for an oblique impact. In addition, viscoelasticity heavily influences the behaviour of the ball deformation and the rebound velocity.</p>
<p>An impact model between the developed ball model and an FE model of a club was constructed using the proposed method for adjusting the initial conditions at impact based on the influences of the conditions on the rebound behaviour of the ball. The trends indicate that it is important to represent not only the higher fidelity of geometry and material properties, but also that of initial conditions, in order to accurately estimate and evaluate the behaviour of the ball, most notably the rebound angle and spin, as well as the rebound velocity.</p>
<p>The results for the rebound behaviour of the ball simulated using the models, constructed by the proposed methods, could accurately represent the experimental results. The methods are applicable to the quick identification of the material constants for the ball model and the initial conditions for impact between the ball and the club. It is also expected that the knowledge of the effects on ball behaviour of the mechanical properties for each section of the ball, may be applicable to the development of new design concepts for a multilayered ball. The approach for impact modelling may be suitable for the examination of club performance and the development of clubs with increased performance which satisfy the restrictions of club properties.</p>

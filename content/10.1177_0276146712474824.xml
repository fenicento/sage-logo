<abstract>
<p>The US housing market involves a network of specialized actors servicing the buying and selling of homes. In the years leading to the housing bubble, this network underwent a significant evolution in response to environmental changes. Prior to the bubble, traditional actors such as local banks, savings and loans, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac predominated. During the bubble, new actors such as mortgage brokers, investment banks, and institutional investors came to displace the traditional ones. Attention is drawn to the activities of new players in the housing market, to the changed roles of traditional players, and to inactivity among regulators. This article presents an overview of system dynamics in terms of the market actors involved and their interrelationships, which culminated in the bursting of the housing bubble. Although many features of this case are unique, some general lessons for marketing systems can be drawn. Marketing systems can come to be dominated by actors formerly in supporting roles; new system structures can fail to serve customers well; and unfounded assumptions can cloud business and policy decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>What is usually referred to as <italic>the</italic> US housing market is in reality a system of multiple, specialized, and interconnected markets. As in market systems generally, would-be buyers are connected with would-be sellers; however, housing has some characteristics not typical of most other market systems. For one thing, the transaction typically involves a number of specialized agents to provide financing, ensure legality of ownership, and so forth. Houses themselves are not identical, thus requiring subjective judgments as to value. A house is the largest financial commitment most consumers make and is not a frequent transaction; consequently the buyers have limited experience. It is for these reasons a highly complex market situation.</p>
<p>The US marketing system under consideration here was originally a network of interconnected markets, that is, the system represented shared participation of multiple types of market actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712474824">Layton 2008</xref>). In this case, the actors include sellers, buyers, bankers, real estate appraisers, mortgage lenders, and real estate agents, among numerous others. To this network, environmental changes induced an evolutionary dynamic and in the process several participants who had previously not been actors (e.g., investment bankers) or who had played only minor roles (e.g., mortgage brokers) grew significantly in importance. That the market was experiencing a bubble was not widely recognized. Both new and established market participants seemed to expect continuously increasing house prices so that higher prices contributed to the urgency to buy, rather than acting as an inhibition.</p>
<p>US home prices rose 67 percent in the eight years to 2006. While some individuals were able to benefit from the increase, many more recent buyers as well as existing homeowners suffered severe financial distress in the subsequent crash of demand and prices. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>) estimates the fall of house prices destroyed nearly $11 trillion in household wealth. Catastrophic as the bursting bubble was to homeowners, problems were not confined to the housing market itself. Marketing systems are open systems, interacting with other spheres of activity such as political, legal, and regulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712474824">Wilkie and Moore 1999</xref>). Many people lost their jobs and their savings in the ensuing economic recession, which has proven to be the most severe with the weakest recovery since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>This article analyzes a particular market system during a time of dynamic change and draws some general lessons for market systems. The purpose is to evaluate the operations of the US housing market system during a cycle of expansion and contraction, with a view toward examining features that may apply to other market networks. The system entered a crisis mode and, in a limited way, some aspects of the situation may generalize to other crises. The limitation stems from the fact that financial crises are highly varied and include such types as inflation cries, currency crises, sovereign debt crises, and banking crises, as well as asset bubble crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146712474824">Reinhart and Rogoff 2009</xref>). The next section outlines the interconnected set of markets that are typically involved in the US housing market. These are described in their approximate pre-boom state. The section following gives an overview of the market dynamics that resulted in systemic changes to the market network and led to the subsequent crash. This is followed by an evaluation in terms of the market and regulatory failures and a discussion of implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0276146712474824">
<title>The Market Network</title>
<p>In terms of sets of transactions, four market groupings related to US housing may be distinguished: primary, real estate facilitation, mortgage, and mortgage facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0276146712474824">Figure 1</xref>). First, the<italic> primary</italic> market to be considered is the exchange between a home seller and a homebuyer, that is, the basic supply and demand factors in housing. Sellers include both existing homeowners and new home builders. Buyers include first time homeowners, previous homeowners changing residence, purchasers of second homes, and property speculators. A salient aspect of marketing systems is the set of flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712474824">Fisk 1967</xref>), which may be represented in several alternate forms. In this section, markets are characterized in terms of flows, specifically flows of material, contact, and contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712474824">Dixon and Wilkinson 1989</xref>). Flows of material are obviously required to build houses, but the following focuses on flows of contact and contract. Of these, flows in the <italic>primary</italic> market involve mainly contract, specifically, transfer of ownership and transfer of money.</p>

</fig>
<p>Second, the sale/purchase of a home is a complex exchange as compared with most other consumer purchases, and typically requires the services of a number of specialized agents in order to complete the transaction. The <italic>real estate</italic> <italic>facilitation</italic> market comprises a number of different services. Several types, such as real estate agents, lawyers, and title-search firms, are not directly involved in conditions surrounding the crisis and will not be further examined here. One type of facilitator, appraisers, does seem to have aggravated the crisis and will be discussed below. Facilitators are primarily involved in contact flows: information, which is instrumental to the conveyance of ownership.</p>
<p>Third, few home buyers have the financial wherewithal to purchase a home outright, but most sellers wish to be paid in full at the time of the sale. The resultant requirement for a loan to complete the transaction creates a need for a specialized type of facilitation: the <italic>mortgage</italic> market. In the <italic>mortgage</italic> market, demand comes from homebuyers and supply comes from financiers. Traditionally, local banks and savings and loan (S&amp;L) associations issued such mortgage loans. Clearly, this market involves the flow of finance. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146712474824">Cox, Goodman, and Fichandler (1965</xref>) point out, the need for financing is closely connected with the issue of time. The fact that the lender will not be completely repaid for a considerable length of time creates risk for the lender. Thus, flows in the mortgage market involve contracts, promises to repay, and money, which engage the risk of nonrepayment. Changes leading to the displacement of the traditional lending arrangement involving local financial agents proved to be a major factor in the crisis and are discussed below.</p>
<p>Fourth, the mortgage business is itself a relatively complex undertaking, which requires its own specialized functions. Thus, there is a <italic>mortgage facilitation</italic> market to augment the lending function. Some of these facilitating functions, such as servicing the loan or assessing credit risk, could be undertaken by either the local lender or by market agents. Other functions, such as mortgage insurance or brokering, are typically done by agents. One particular function, repurchasing mortgages, had involved giant government-sponsored entities, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), who made a market in mortgages. Fannie and Freddie’s traditional role was to supply liquidity to local lenders by buying qualified mortgages so that the local lenders could make additional loans. The <italic>mortgage facilitation</italic> market primarily involves flows of contact (information) but in its more extended forms can involve flows of contract (money) and risk as well. Changes in this market also proved to be a major factor in the crisis.</p>
<p>Traditional modes of operation in the networked housing market had produced a fairly stable equilibrium in the decades after World War II. However, changes in the US housing market during the boom years leading up to 2006 had wide-ranging ramifications for balance in the housing market network. In particular, the amplification of risk is a key element, and flows of accurate information are critical to the evaluation and mitigation of risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0276146712474824">
<title>Network Dynamics</title>
<p>Two environmental changes affected the housing market network, giving impetus to the US housing boom and subsequent bust. One was a joint political/industry effort to broaden the base of home ownership to include more lower-income and minority households. Programs such as the joint government–industry National Partners in Homeownership of 1994 set goals for higher levels of homeownership and identified tactics to achieve them. The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) agency was the lead federal agency in this initiative and was directed to promote homeownership and eliminate housing discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>). Among other tactics, HUD directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to adopt lower standards for the mortgages they bought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>). Such initiatives to boost home ownership were supplementary to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977, which was aimed at reducing discrimination in lending. Whereas the later initiatives are widely thought to have contributed to the housing crisis, opinions are somewhat divided on whether the CRA played a similar role. Most conclude that the CRA did not directly contribute to the crisis, so much as provide justification to promoters and supporters of the subsequent initiatives. Lending standards did not noticeably deteriorate until the 1990s.</p>
<p>Efforts to broaden homeownership received the imprimatur of powerful elites, from a series of presidents to Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan to Representative Barney Frank, among others. Initiatives to boost homeownership were also given a strong impetus from lobbyists representing the homebuilding and banking industries. Broadly based political forces were being influenced, in part, by market insiders who stood to benefit from them—a classic instance of the political economy of marketing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712474824">Arndt 1981</xref>). The exercise of power by insiders was not limited to demand stimulation but will also be seen below to affect banking regulation. Pushed by the dual political and business stimulus, homeownership rates rose from 65 percent to 69 percent between 1997 and 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712474824">Shiller 2008</xref>). This represents an increase of approximately four million households. In other words, demand in the <italic>primary</italic> housing market received a substantial boost from the political side.</p>
<p>The other environmental change was a significant shift in the financing of mortgages. It had long been common practice that mortgages were issued by local banks or S&amp;L associations. These agencies often held the loans on their own books, which furnished them with a keen interest in the prospects for repayment. Holding the loans, however, had the effect of limiting their ability to make additional loans. Consequently, from the 1980s, it was becoming more common for banks and S&amp;Ls to sell mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. At about this time, laws restricting interstate banking were changed, allowing regional and national banks to take up a role in formerly localized markets.</p>
<p>Increasingly, mortgage brokers of regional and national scope, rather than local lenders, originated mortgages. In addition to the expansion of market scope, significant structural changes in the <italic>mortgage</italic> and <italic>mortgage facilitation</italic> markets occurred, as discussed below. Because interest rate yields were lower on many alternative instruments, institutional investors found the yields on pooled mortgages attractive. Subsequently, many mortgages were securitized and sold to institutional investors, of national and international scope. In this way, the mortgages of individual homeowners came into the possession of large banks and hedge funds that had no direct knowledge of the home or its owner. Ultimately, high investor demand for securitized subprime mortgages gave an important impetus to the boom and bust cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0276146712474824">
<title>Demand Dynamics in Primary and Mortgage Facilitation Markets</title>
<p>The housing bubble in the United States involved fundamental alterations proceeding from these two environmental changes, involving financing and risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146712474824">Figure 2</xref>). As noted above, the US housing market is in reality a nexus of markets. In this highly interconnected network, change in one sector may have consequences throughout the network. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146712474824">Layton (2007</xref>) points out, impetus for change occurs when markets fail to offer what customers want. In this case, demands at two different points in the market system had profound effects, both within and beyond the system.</p>
<p>In the first set of demands, from the <italic>primary</italic> market, more potential homebuyers had wanted to buy homes than were able obtain approval for a mortgage. That is, actual home sales were lower than effective demand. This was an imbalance of long-standing, one which US government initiatives to boost homeownership were meant to rectify. For many years, the <italic>mortgage</italic> market had been functioning as a gatekeeper to home ownership, in addition to its role in providing finance. By denying credit to underqualified potential buyers, local banks and S&amp;Ls performed a quality assurance function.</p>

</fig>
<p>By the 1990s, policy directives of the federal government encouraged mortgage lenders to relax their standards in order to provide mortgages to individuals who would not previously have qualified. These were the so-called subprime borrowers, and the loans made to them became known as subprime mortgages. Demand for homes by the newly increased number of buyers helped to extend a bubble in house prices that had begun with low mortgage interest rates. For reasons of macroeconomic policy, the Fed lowered interest rates significantly and kept them low.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0276146712474824">1</xref></sup> Importantly, the track record of continuous price increases stimulated an expectation of continued price increases in the future, which contributed to further increases in house prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146712474824">Nakajima 2011</xref>). This led both borrowers and lenders to assume that subprime loans could be easily refinanced in the future.</p>
<p>In the second set of demands, from the <italic>mortgage</italic> market, institutional investors sharply increased their demand for securitized mortgages, particularly subprime securities. Because of low yields on more traditional fixed-income investments and higher yields on mortgage securities, investor demand for the latter grew substantially. Especially attractive from the standpoint of higher yields were securitized subprime mortgages, and demand for these escalated dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146712474824">Galbraith 2008</xref>). Stresses arose within the network because demand for securitized mortgages was greater than the supply of financially eligible borrowers. “Securitization was fast becoming the beast that needed constant feeding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>, 143). In this way, the demand of investors coincided with government policy in encouraging lending to underqualified buyers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0276146712474824">
<title>Investment Banks as Channel Captains</title>
<p>In order to increase the supply of securitized mortgages, the intermediation of investment banks was required. Indeed, investment banks came to play a pivotal role in stimulating and directing the activities of mortgage originators so as to supply the demand of institutional investors. The result was the development of an essentially new structure in the <italic>mortgage</italic> market: a channel of distribution in which the investment banks acted in the role of channel captains. What was earlier a facilitation market intended to increase the liquidity of local banks became a channel to supply securities to institutional investors. Note that the other three markets did not evolve in this manner.</p>
<p>In this channel, new types of actors came to play much more central and critical roles than previously. Loans were issued to borrowers by mortgage brokers, a practice which came to be dominated by national level firms such as Countrywide, New Century, Wells Fargo, and National City. These originators did not hold the mortgages on their own books, but sold them to others, developing a new “originate-to-distribute” model of lending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146712474824">Lerner and Tufano 2011</xref>). Thus, issuance of mortgages came to be dominated by mortgage brokers acting more like <italic>facilitators</italic> than traditional lenders. These brokers initiated a series of transactions that ultimately placed ownership of the loans in the hands of institutional investors around the world. In effect, the institutional investors ceased to be facilitators who supplied finance and became the mortgage holders themselves. That is, their role shifted from the <italic>mortgage facilitation</italic> market to the <italic>mortgage</italic> market, while loan originators made a switch in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Within the channel that had become the <italic>mortgage</italic> market, mortgage brokers not only modified their role, but expanded markedly in the process. In the course of the housing boom, brokerages hired over 200,000 new employees as mortgage sellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). These employees had either no or only limited experience in mortgage lending and were incentivized by sales commissions and fees. Since the firms had no plans to hold the mortgages themselves, the brokers made little effort to ensure that repayment was likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712474824">Shiller 2008</xref>). Loan officers were told in no uncertain terms that quantity was more important than quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In a change from past practice, the brokers made use of advertising and direct marketing campaigns to attract additional borrowers not infrequently using bait-and-switch tactics. Brokers received higher fees and commissions for subprime loans, and thus steered borrowers toward those products. In the boom years, these “nontraditional” loans accounted for over half of new mortgages. Brokers made more money putting borrowers into risky loans than safe ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). Abusive and predatory lending practices were especially a concern for minority and low-income homebuyers, involving high rates and high fees—especially on second mortgages and refinancings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The supply of mortgages thus generated were bundled and securitized by investment banks such as Goldman Sachs Group, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers. Investment banks not only sought to connect supply and demand but also were the architects of the securities involved. Securitized mortgages are a complex mix of thousands of individual mortgages, which are pooled into groups that, in turn, are subgrouped into “tranches” with different levels of risk. Investors in packaged mortgage securities rely on the opinion of securities ratings agencies (about which, more below) to judge the quality of the securities. Each level was assigned a rating by one of the securities rating agencies and sold to investors with different yield/risk preferences. Levels with riskiness too high to be sold directly to investors were repackaged into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and rerated by the agencies. Remarkably, many tranches of the CDOs were rated higher than their original rating in the first packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). Here again, in the <italic>mortgage facilitation</italic>, market quantity was paramount and quality secondary. Investor demand was so strong that the investment banks could not keep up with it. Consequently, the banks made another noteworthy financial invention: “synthetic” CDOs, which contained no actual mortgages, but instead were securities that tracked the performance of CDOs that did contain them.</p>
<p>In parallel with the investment banks, Fannie and Freddie—who traditionally made a secondary market in mortgages—began to also securitize them and sell these to institutional investors on a large scale. Altogether some $1.6 trillion in mortgages of dubious quality were purchased or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>). Like the investment banks, Fannie and Freddie also worked with mortgage brokers, such as Countrywide, to facilitate their supply of subprime mortgages. Rather than limiting their role to supplying liquidity to local lenders, Fannie and Freddie became full competitors of the investment banks. Indeed, Fannie Mae led the way in relaxing lending standards, which was soon followed by private lenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>). Continued demand for subprime securities by institutional investors stimulated a further lowering of lending standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0276146712474824">
<title>Maladaptation in the Bubble</title>
<p>The development of a new channel in the housing market network was accompanied by a number of distortions. In the <italic>mortgage</italic> market, incomplete information and misinformation created major problems for borrowers and, eventually, for investors. Many subprime loans were granted without documentation of the borrower’s ability to pay (aka “liar’s loans”) and incomplete documentation (aka “Alt-A” loans). So-called affordability products included interest-only loans, negative amortization loans, and adjustable rate mortgages. Many carried steeply increased rates after two or three years of initially low “teaser” rates and some had steep balloon payments. The quality of subprime loans began to deteriorate as early as 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146712474824">Demyanyk and Hasan 2009</xref>). Unbeknownst to borrowers, many of these loans were on much worse terms than had been offered to other borrowers. Few would be able to keep up payments in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712474824">Sherman 2011</xref>). Such nontraditional loans were targeted mainly toward low-income individuals, many of who did not understand their terms and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>). Lenders, of course, well knew the terms and the likely consequences but were taking advantage of the information asymmetry that came to characterize the market.</p>
<p>Pressures emanating from the <italic>mortgage</italic> market compromised the professional independence of one type of actor in the <italic>real-estate facilitation</italic> market. Some appraisal agencies began to knowingly inflate estimates of home values. Fees and commissions paid to mortgage brokers increased along with the price of the property involved and, as a result, appraisers were pressured by the brokers to put artificially high valuations on properties. A survey from 2003 indicated that 55 percent of appraisers felt pressure to inflate values; by 2006, 90 percent reported such pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). The HUD had changed rules that formerly required appraisers to be independent of mortgage brokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>). Indeed, some brokers opened their own appraisal subsidiaries to deliver the desired results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Information asymmetries also affected banking and securities regulators. Lack of transparency in the mortgage securities market led regulators to believe that risk had been diversified, when in fact it had been concentrated in the financial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). The extent of leverage was often hidden, through derivatives positions, off-balance sheet entities, and “window dressing” of financial reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). Overall, distortions in the flow of information through the housing market may be classified as belonging to the category of “market dysfunctionalities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146712474824">Layton and Grossbart 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Pooled and securitized mortgages are complex instruments, making their quality difficult for investors to assess. Ultimately, the task fell to securities ratings agencies (known as NRSRO’s for nationally recognized statistical rating organizations): S&amp;P, Moody’s Investors Services, and Fitch Inc. As is the case with several sectors of the <italic>mortgage facilitation</italic> market, mortgage securities became an increasingly important source of income and profit for ratings agencies. For instance, Moody’s rating of structured finance products represented nearly half of revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Evaluating the riskiness of securities in which mortgages have been bundled, packaged, and repackaged is an intricate task. Experience is crucial to the assessment of potential risks, but the rating agencies had little track record. Working in concert with the investment banks who pay the fees for the ratings service ratings of the quality of subprime securities proved to be unrealistically high. Of the mortgage securities rated AAA (the highest rating) in 2006, 83 percent were later downgraded. The failures of the ratings agencies were an especially pivotal breakdown in the view of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC (2011</xref>, xxv): “The three credit rating agencies were key enablers of the financial meltdown. The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval.”</p>
<p>Actors in the facilitation market also underestimated the riskiness of the securities. Insurers of mortgages seem to have purposely held insufficient reserves against the foreclosures that might, and eventually did, overtake subprime borrowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146712474824">Laing 2011</xref>). Securities insurers such as American International Group (AIG) wrote credit default swaps (CDSs), essentially insurance against default, on CDOs, and other mortgage securities, holding insufficient reserves against default. The CDSs enabled expansion of the mortgage securitization pipeline. With the CDSs written by AIG and others, banks needed fewer reserves against holding CDO’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). Absent a market in CDSs, the market for CDOs could never have become as large as it did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146712474824">Brown and Hao 2012</xref>). These actors and these products had formerly played no role in the housing market.</p>
<p>Many of the actors in the <italic>mortgage</italic> market, such as investment banks, finance companies, and hedge funds are known collectively as “shadow banks.” The compensation packages for chief executives in these firms provided incentives to push highly profitable, but risky deals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146712474824">Bicksler 2008</xref>). They failed in controlling the risk and in providing information to investors and regulators. In this respect, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC (2011</xref>, xvii) concluded, “ … financial institutions made, bought, and sold securities they never examined, did not care to examine, or knew to be defective”. Further, it has become clear that the institutional investors who bought the securities failed to understand in adequate detail the nature of the products that they bought, resulting in their overreliance on securities ratings agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712474824">Shiller 2008</xref>). Where there should have been transparency and information in <italic>mortgage</italic> markets, there was instead either a lack of information or misinformation, leading to a buildup of enormous levels of risk. Throughout the boom cycle, no indication exists that any of the actors attempted to improve transparency or enforce higher standards among other members of the market network.</p>

<title>Bursting the Bubble</title>
<p>The increased level of demand in the <italic>primary</italic> market for houses was not sustainable in the long run because of deterioration in loan portfolios. In the short run, however, there were numerous opportunities to profit, and not just for businesses in the network. Due to changes in federal tax laws, sellers of a primary residence could cash out at high prices with no capital gains liability. Markets were riddled with misinformation. By mid-2006, home prices had started to decline and foreclosures were rising, but investment banks still created and sold an additional $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). Toward the end of the boom, some subprime loans went delinquent within months of issuance.</p>
<p>When housing prices entered their decline stage, the assumption of continuously rising prices became demonstrably false, and the system began to falter. Home sellers were stuck with homes for which neither they nor anyone else could get a loan; mortgage brokers were stuck with mortgages which investment bankers no longer wanted; investment banks were stuck with mortgage securities which investors no longer wanted; and investors were stuck with distressed or nonexistent collateral. In the crash, even prime borrowers found themselves “underwater”—their homes were worth less than the amount they owed on their mortgages. Foreclosure was the outcome for many borrowers, both prime and subprime. With rising foreclosures adding to an oversupply of housing, house prices continued to spiral downward.</p>
<p>Losses and economic instability in markets around the world followed close on the US housing crash. Contrary to what seems a common misconception, the house price bubble did not start in the United States and then spread outward. Between the mid-1990's and 2003, house prices in Australia, Britain, Ireland, and Spain, among others, were up 50 percent or more, while US prices were up only 30 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712474824">
<italic>The Economist</italic> 2003</xref>). Low interest rates, lack of other investment opportunities, and speculation were worldwide phenomena. Among developed nations, only Germany and Japan avoided large price increases. Nor did the US market initiate the decline in house prices: prices in Australia and Britain had peaked a year earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0276146712474824">
<italic>The Economist</italic> 2005</xref>). What <italic>did</italic> originate in the United States and radiate outward was a cascade of losses on subprime securities, creating immense strain on banks and other financial institutions around the world.</p>
<p>An old adage says that forewarned is forearmed. Many doubt that financial crises are reliably predictable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146712474824">Reinhart and Rogoff 2009</xref>). Indeed, in 2000, housing expert Robert Shiller described house price increases as “tiny” in comparison with equities price increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146712474824">Shiller 2000</xref>). Soon, however, a few sources began to predict future troubles. In 2003, <italic>The Economist</italic> warned of frothiness in numerous housing markets. It noted several symptoms which typically accompany a bubble: house prices were a hot topic of conversation at social gatherings, the belief that “this time is different,” and the expectation of a continued rise in prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712474824">
<italic>The Economist</italic> 2003</xref>). Two years later, “We have been warning for some time that the price of housing was rising at an alarming rate all around the globe, including in America … How the current housing boom ends could decide the course of the entire world economy over the next few years” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0276146712474824">
<italic>The Economist</italic> 2005</xref>, 11). We now know how the boom ended.</p>
<p>The contagious inrush of many buyers, new-era thinking, and the expectation of ever-rising prices are typical of bubbles, including the dotcom bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146712474824">Shiller 2000</xref>) and the classic South Sea Bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146712474824">Mackay 1841</xref>). The trick to spotting bubbles when the majority does not appears to be twofold. First, one needs to take a long-term perspective by ignoring current enthusiasms and looking back over the repeated cycles. Second, one must view the data realistically, unalloyed by thoughts about market exceptionalism (“this time is different”). Perhaps of greater significance is the distinction between predicting a bubble and preventing one. As discussed below, policy makers may discount predictions of trouble until it is too late to do much about it.</p>

<title>Market Failure</title>
<p>Competitive markets are widely seen as desirable arrangements for purposes of exchange, as opposed to alternatives such as command or monopoly. However, it is also widely recognized that markets are not without faults. The housing market, which seemed so buoyant and beneficent in 2005, had turned into an economic and social disaster by 2007. This section and the next section employ the “failures framework” developed by James Carman and Robert Harris.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146712474824">Harris and Carman (1983</xref>) identify and discuss several basic types of market failure, two of which are most relevant for the present analysis. These two, which are interdependent and interactive to a degree, are (1) imperfect information and (2) presence of externalities. As emphasized above, information was a particularly prevalent problem throughout many sectors of the evolved housing market network. Harris and Carman identify several subcategories of information failure, four of which are relevant here. First is information asymmetry, which negatively impacted the decisions made by both subprime borrowers and institutional investors. Second is misinformation, which negatively impacted borrowers who were subject to misleading sales pitches and bait-and-switch tactics. Third is lack of information, which seems to have hampered regulators’ evaluation and appreciation of the extent of risk in the housing market. Fourth is bounded rationality, which resulted in an inappropriate use of the information that was available. This affected nearly all parties involved but seems to have been a particularly critical problem with respect to the securities ratings agencies.</p>
<p>Information problems compound the bounded rationality condition of the actors so affected and prevent them from achieving their best interests via marketplace transactions. These problems appear to have been acute for institutional investors, ratings agencies, regulators, and many borrowers. It is worth noting that the actions of two types of market players do not seem to have been impaired by information problems: mortgage brokers and investment bankers. In fact, these two types of market actors, who had been outsiders but rose to prominence during the boom years, appear to have been the source of information problems for others.</p>
<p>Second is the market failure caused by negative externalities. Because the subprime mortgage market was so extensive, the ramifications of its collapse were far-reaching in scope and impact, affecting many nontransacting parties. The bursting of the housing bubble negatively impacted all homeowners, not merely recent or subprime borrowers. Among prime homeowners, the collapse of house prices caused widespread distress, including loss of equity and immobility. Fear in credit markets stimulated a liquidity crisis that negatively affected banks unconnected with mortgage securities as well as innumerable nonfinancial firms. The housing crash was directly tied to the financial crisis that had profoundly negative economic and social consequences around the world.</p>
<p>Financial markets, because of their high degree of interconnection, are particularly prone to produce widespread externalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712474824">Frankel 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146712474824">Lerner and Tufano 2011</xref>). Financial firms do not price into their activities the costs their losses might impose on society as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146712474824">Prasch 2011</xref>). That is, the costs are uncalculated exchange outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146712474824">Mundt 1993</xref>). Securitized mortgages and associated derivatives gave the appearance of diversifying risk, when in fact risk had been concentrated at key points in the financial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). Like numerous other authors, Harris and Carman’s prime example of a negative externality is pollution. The ripple effects of the housing crash beyond the housing market might well be considered a form of financial pollution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0276146712474824">
<title>Regulatory Failure</title>
<p>Just as markets may be imperfect, regulations designed to protect consumers and others may also be imperfect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712474824">Harris and Carman (1984</xref>) outline a number of regulatory responses to market failures. These are remedies devised by governments, typically initiated at the federal level, which are intended to improve the functioning of markets in terms of competitiveness, efficiency, or fairness. In the housing crisis, governmental and government-sponsored attempts to aid at-risk borrowers included refinancing and temporary suspension of payments for the unemployed. The government also supported consumer advocacy of mortgage terms, but such efforts were deemed too small make much of a difference in the crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146712474824">Shiller 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present case, remedies involving improved information disclosure or standardization of mortgage contracts would seem appropriate responses. However, legislative attempts to remedy the failure thus far appear unpromising. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act did not address the “too-big-to-fail” syndrome among large banks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146712474824">
<italic>The Economist</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712474824">Morgenson and Rosner 2011</xref>). It also left undisturbed the significant amounts of leverage used in mortgage securities and improved transparency in derivatives markets to only a limited extent. The remedies did not go far enough: financial innovations were at the heart of the crisis, but the US government has failed to restructure the financial system in ways that would reduce the likelihood of a similar crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146712474824">Stiglitz 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712474824">Carman and Harris (1986</xref>) assess different types and consequences of regulatory failure. For example, a type of bureaucratic failure may exist when two agencies have overlapping or ill-defined jurisdictions. In the housing market, this occurred in the oversight of actors in the shadow banking system. There was uncertainty as to whether the Federal Reserve or the Federal Trade Commission held supervisory authority over the sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). However, for reasons outlined below, whether jurisdictional certainty would have led to more effective oversight is unclear.</p>
<p>A second issue concerns design of the regulations themselves and, in particular, the differential influence of interest groups on the content and implementation of regulation. Politicization of the design process may lead to regulatory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712474824">Carman and Harris 1986</xref>). Lobbyists working on behalf of the market actors subject to regulations can lead to “capture” of the legislators and/or regulatory agencies involved. Through extensive lobbying efforts the financial industry, especially the shadow banking system, was instrumental in weakening regulatory constraints and heading off newly proposed regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>). The use of power to attempt to control the market system, in the political economy sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712474824">Arndt 1981</xref>), was evident. Between 1999 and 2008, members of the financial industry reported $2.7 billion in lobbying expenses, while individuals and Political Action Committees (PACs) contributed over $1 billion to lawmakers’ reelection campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A peculiar type of regulatory failure, not listed by Carman and Harris, played a significant role in the crisis. Lack of interest in performing their regulatory role, for ideological reasons, is not commonly noted among the shortcomings of regulators. In this case, however, existing mortgage regulations were not applied, and supervision was lax by intent rather than inattention or oversight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146712474824">Kregel 2011</xref>). Regulatory inaction helped to undermine lending standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146712474824">Epstein 2012</xref>). This apparent lapse occurred as the result of a conviction that markets are self-regulating entities and that self-correction mechanisms are more efficient than governmental interference in markets. In the words of the Commission, “The sentries were not at their posts, in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self-correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively police themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>, xviii).</p>
<p>It should be noted that during the boom the Fed was, in fact, fully empowered to restore and enforce prudent lending standards, but did not do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712474824">FCIC 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712474824">Shiller 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146712474824">Stiglitz 2010</xref>). A strong belief in the self-regulating quality of markets precluded the perceived need to restore previous standards. A corollary to the ideology of self-regulating financial markets is that asset bubbles simply do not happen. Up through 2005, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan discounted the idea of a bubble in housing prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146712474824">Starr 2012</xref>). The Fed was not alone in its support of the housing market: powerful political and industry figures, as well as other federal agencies, were also so aligned. However, the Fed did have primary responsibility in this area.</p>
<p>The intellectual underpinning of the self-regulating markets thesis is based upon the work of Friedrich von Hayek, who proposed that the price system coordinates the decisions of dispersed individuals, each of whom need have only a partial knowledge of the whole. In this way, thousands of decision makers effectively interact to arrive at an efficient summary of available, but dispersed, information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146712474824">Hayek 1945</xref>). However, Hayek’s perspective envisioned conditions closer to perfect competition and highly rational decision makers, rather than the conditions of oligopoly and bounded rationality prevalent in the housing crisis. Since virtually no markets are perfectly competitive and populated by perfectly rational decision makers, virtually no markets are fully self-correcting. Ideologies and prior beliefs about the behavior of markets and market actors have a framing effect on the thinking of observers that distorts perceptions of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146712474824">Redmond, 2013</xref>). This framing effect tends to persist until the discrepancy between perception and reality becomes impossible to ignore. The US housing crisis is an example <italic>par excellence</italic> of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Carman and Harris developed the failures framework in the 1980s, based partly on economic theory and partly on a pragmatic understanding of market behaviors. While it will continue to be a powerful tool for understanding markets, two developments since that time indicate that the framework might benefit from renewed attention. First is the increased emphasis on marketing systems and globalization in the macromarketing literature. The failures framework anticipates single markets but networked systems appear to present additional modes of market failure and additional challenges for regulation. Second is the magnified role of market ideology in policy and regulatory decisions. Failure to exercise extant regulatory authority is one problem; failure to adopt clearly needed regulations is another. The belief in self-regulating markets, which would seem to have been discredited in the market crash, is still held to be valid among many bankers and politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146712474824">Prasch 2012</xref>). In consequence, the government has failed to restructure the financial system in ways that would reduce the likelihood of a similar crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146712474824">Stiglitz 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0276146712474824">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The US housing market is a system of interconnecting markets that has undergone large-scale dynamic change. Being dynamic, the market responded to changes, but also caused them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146712474824">Dixon 1984</xref>). That is, society affected the marketing system and the marketing system affected society. In this case, demand for housing and demand for investments resulted in a systemic response that altered fundamental properties of the system. The altered system, in turn, amplified risks in ways not fully appreciated within or outside the market, resulting in crisis.</p>
<p>Overlapping systems can interact in a number of ways, and the type of overlap is important to understanding system behavior. Depending on whether they are competitive or supportive, the overlaps may constrain or encourage behaviors. For instance, food systems and ethanol systems overlap in that they both use corn as an input and are competitive at that point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712474824">Burkink and Marquardt 2009</xref>). In the case of housing, the overlap was money, and the multiple points of overlap were supportive. Money flowed from pooled mortgages to individual mortgages to house purchases. However, the overlaps were not merely supportive, but had an amplifying effect. The apparent success of the earlier subprime securities caused a demand for more, and then for even more, while continuously lowered lending standards amplified primary housing demand.</p>
<p>The housing market is a complex system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146712474824">Mittelstaedt, Kilbourne, and Mittlestaedt (2006)</xref> identify three classes of antecedent factors that contribute to market heterogeneity and complexity: formal, informal, and philosophical (or ideological). Examples all three are found in the housing crisis. Formal antecedents include securities contracts and changes in capital gains taxation; informal ones include incentives to push loans among mortgage brokers and competitiveness among investment banks; ideological include the ideal of home ownership and the belief in self-correcting markets. The housing market was complex prior to the boom, but these factors combined to make the market complicated to the point of instability. Market systems do not necessarily become more complex over time, but conceivably increased complexity serves the interests of certain market actors. In the case of housing, investment banks were aided by a lack of transparency when dealing with customers, regulators, and rating agencies.</p>
<p>Changes in the system alter traditional relations among market actors and produces social impacts beyond the marketplace. A loan is a contract, whereas a security is property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712474824">Frankel 1991</xref>). That is, a loan creates a relationship between a borrower and lender, but a tradable security is simply a commodity, leaving institutional investors with no stake in a relationship and no interest in working with struggling borrowers. Societal development is a concern of macromarketers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146712474824">Peterson 2006</xref>). The health of social institutions plays a key role in future developments in the economic, political, and social spheres. The housing bust has left many questioning the place of homeownership as a central value in the American Dream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146712474824">Redmond 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-0276146712474824">
<title>Systems Performance</title>
<p>Market systems exist to serve the needs of sellers and buyers. How well did this system work? In addition to considerations of market failure noted above, three points may be observed regarding market dynamics.</p>
<p>First, the market did what market systems are fundamentally supposed to do. The system responded on the supply side to meet changing conditions of demand for both housing and investments. In the <italic>primary</italic> market, homeownership reached record levels; in the <italic>mortgage</italic> market, huge amounts of securitized mortgages were delivered. In order to accomplish this, the mortgage market was transformed into a large-scale channel of distribution.</p>
<p>Second, the roles played by various actors in the marketing network raise questions of balance. The term facilitation would seem to imply a supporting role, in contrast to the main value adders in terms of primary supply and demand of a commodity. Nevertheless, the question must be asked: did the mortgage market come to dominate the US housing market? Considering the driving role of finance in this market, the answer would seem to be yes. Meeting the demands of institutional investors for higher yields created great turmoil in the housing market and displaced experienced actors. In this case, the tail did wag the dog.</p>
<p>Finally is the key question of how well the system served its two main customer groups (i.e., home buyers and securitized mortgage investors). Virtually, no one involved in the housing market seemed to feel as though they had any particular duty to protect the home buyer/mortgage borrower. Real estate agents typically act in the interests of the seller; mortgage originators dissembled and engaged in predatory lending; appraisers inflated prices; and government regulators looked the other way. As a result, many borrowers were drawn into unsuitable transactions. At the opposite end of the channel, institutional investors were also on the wrong end of inopportune transactions. Investment banks sold toxic products that the ratings agencies were unable to spot. The twin sources of demand drove the market dynamics, but neither was well served by their suppliers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0276146712474824">
<title>Caveats for Systems</title>
<p>While a number of developments in the US housing market network are specific to that system, some appear generalizable to complex market systems that are subject to cyclical behavior. The following points are interrelated to a substantial degree.</p>
<p>Beware an influx of new market actors, particularly those lacking a track record in the business. In the present case, many new actors acquired powerful roles but had little appreciation of the possibility for adverse conditions, especially involving price declines and the attendant escalation of risks. Newer actors were principally actuated by greed, held very short-term orientations, and had little regard for the well-being of customers. Unrestrained by formal or informal institutions or by the expectation of long-term relations, these actors set up a systemic crisis and many of them have now withdrawn altogether. In principle, this is a question of system boundaries: who is inside the system and who is outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146712474824">Layton 2007</xref>)? The boundaries in this case proved to be all too permeable.</p>
<p>Beware the creation of new market structures, especially when these serve to connect previously unconnected networks. This is a particular concern when a new structure appears relatively rapidly and involves large volumes of business. Here, a new channel connected the housing market with financial markets in a way that unleashed an unprecedented flow of money into housing. This connection bypassed the traditional quality assurance providers in the housing market; consequently the flow of money became a destructive force in the market.</p>
<p>Beware the effects of assumptions and ideologies. Often stated but infrequently scrutinized assumptions about the behavior of others eventually leads to strategic missteps. Because homeownership is beneficial for some does not imply that it is equally good for all. Market ideologies, on the other hand, seek to imbue markets with qualities they do not possess or at least not in a sufficiently pure and strong form. In the case of financial markets, the depth and breadth of the acceptance of the self-correcting markets thesis amounted to group think (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146712474824">DeMartino 2011</xref>). Market systems are no more self-regulating than markets themselves. The solution is not necessarily changing the system, but properly regulating its activities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146712474824">Meade and Nason (1991</xref>, 72) proposed that macromarketing comprises the study of the “growth, evolution and design” of marketing systems. In the case of the US housing crisis, we see the results of system growth and evolution in the absence of design. The US housing market did not enter into a violent boom/bust cycle of its own accord. It was flooded with money from a formerly separated market. Politicians and industry lobbyists encouraged this flow; regulators failed to stop it. The housing system simply could not cope with the demands of the finance participants. Market participants and regulators failed to gain a clear idea of how rapidly the market was approaching widespread foreclosure and default. The essential problem should have been clear, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146712474824">Layton (2007</xref>, 237) observes: “The need for effective regulation of marketing system growth and change is widely recognized.” Apparently, not widely enough, and thus the continuing need for a broader dissemination of macromarketing scholarship.</p>

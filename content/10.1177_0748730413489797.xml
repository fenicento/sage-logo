<abstract>
<p>Phase resetting by light is an important feature of circadian rhythms, and the current <italic>Drosophila</italic> model focuses on light-mediated degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). PERIOD (PER) is the binding partner of TIM and a major repressor of the molecular clock, but direct evidence of PER in phase resetting is lacking. Because light sensitivity of the <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> short period mutant strain is strongly enhanced compared with wild-type strains, we assayed the importance of PER degradation for light-induced phase shifting. The <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> protein (PERS) is markedly less stable than wild-type PER, in tissue culture and in flies, and PERS as well as PER is stabilized by TIM in both systems. Consistent with this finding, light-induced TIM degradation appears to trigger PER degradation. Moreover, TIM degradation is similar in the clock neurons of both strains, suggesting that it is not strongly affected by PERS and does not dictate the difference in the light response. In contrast, there is a dramatic quantitative difference between PER and PERS degradation in these neurons, indicating that PER degradation dictates the enhanced amplitude of the light-induced phase response. The data indicate that TIM inhibits PER degradation and that PER degradation follows light-mediated TIM degradation within circadian neurons; PER degradation then dictates qualitative as well as quantitative features of light-mediated phase-resetting.</p>

<p>Circadian clocks control the physiology and behavior of most eukaryotes and even some prokaryotes. This endogenous clock keeps ticking with a period of about 24 h even without temporal input from the environment. The circadian mechanism of <italic>Drosophila</italic> includes a transcriptional feedback loop, which controls the cycling expression of multiple clock genes including <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>). The transcription of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> is activated by a heterodimer of 2 basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC). The mRNA levels of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> peak in the early night, and their proteins (PER and TIM), accumulate to peak levels in the middle to late night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730413489797">Hardin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730413489797">Marrus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0748730413489797">Sehgal et al., 1995</xref>) in fly heads. PER and TIM then enter the nucleus, where they inhibit the transcriptional activity of CLK:CYC and as a consequence their own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730413489797">Darlington et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730413489797">Nawathean and Rosbash, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748730413489797">Saez and Young, 1996</xref>). A similar feedback loop operates in mammals.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> mutant strain is 1 of 3 original <italic>per</italic> alleles isolated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730413489797">Konopka and Benzer in 1971</xref>. Its free running locomotor activity rhythm is striking, about 5 h shorter than wild-type (wt) strains. The <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> mutation is a serine to arginine missense mutation at amino acid 589 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730413489797">Bargiello et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0748730413489797">Yu et al., 1987</xref>). The region surrounding position 589 is intimately related to the DOUBLETIME (DBT) kinase. This is an important PER modifying enzyme and a casein kinase I family member, which affects circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730413489797">Kloss et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748730413489797">Preuss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730413489797">Price et al., 1998</xref>). The recent study by Edery and colleagues indicates that the normal phosphorylation of the 589 serine by DBT inhibits the rate of phosphorylation at other key sites and therefore delays the daily PER degradation program. The S589N mutation in the <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> protein (PERS) prevents this phosphorylation and therefore causes premature phosphorylation at the other key sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730413489797">Chiu et al., 2011</xref>). All features of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> cycling, including those of PERS abundance and phosphorylation, are advanced in these flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730413489797">Edery et al., 1994</xref>). Also significantly advanced is <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> mRNA cycling, which suggests premature PERS transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730413489797">Hardin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730413489797">Marrus et al., 1996</xref>). It is unknown whether all these advances are due to a primary effect of the mutation on PER half-life.</p>
<p>Another complication is that PER and TIM form a heterodimer, in artificial systems as well as in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730413489797">Gekakis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748730413489797">Zeng et al., 1996</xref>). Although the function of the PER-TIM complex is uncertain, considerable data indicate that TIM and the PER-TIM complex are necessary for the nuclear entry of PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730413489797">Hunter-Ensor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748730413489797">Saez and Young, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748730413489797">Vosshall et al., 1994</xref>). This is despite the fact that other experiments indicate that PER and TIM enter the nucleus independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730413489797">Meyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730413489797">Nawathean and Rosbash, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the observation that PER is more unstable without TIM in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730413489797">Price et al., 1995</xref>), it is believed that PER is stabilized within the PER-TIM complex. Perhaps it protects PER from phosphorylation by DBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730413489797">Cyran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730413489797">Kloss et al., 2001</xref>), or perhaps the complex is more accessible to stabilizing phosphates like protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730413489797">Fang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748730413489797">Sathyanarayanan et al., 2004</xref>). It is also unknown whether these possibilities might help explain the difference between PERS and PER.</p>
<p>Possibly relevant to the PER-TIM complex is the sensitivity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian rhythms to light. A short light pulse in the early night causes a phase delay of fly locomotor activity rhythms, whereas a late night light pulse causes a phase advance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748730413489797">Saunders et al., 1994</xref>). These are general features of the phase-response curve (PRC) of many circadian systems including those of mammals. The current model in flies is based on light-mediated degradation of TIM: Light triggers a conformational change of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blue light photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) within circadian neurons. This causes formation of a CRY-TIM complex and then rapid TIM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730413489797">Busza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730413489797">Ceriani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730413489797">Emery et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730413489797">Hunter-Ensor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748730413489797">Stanewsky et al., 1998</xref>). In the early night, a light pulse therefore causes premature TIM degradation, which delays the TIM accumulation profile and leads to a phase delay. A late night light pulse accelerates the TIM degradation profile and therefore causes a phase advance. However, this model does not explain why there is little or no phase response to a light pulse during the middle of the night between the delay and the advance zone regions of the PRC. This is the so-called “crossover region” of a PRC. Relevant to this issue is the PRC of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies, which was found long ago to have relatively little light-insensitivity, that is, little or no crossover region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748730413489797">Saunders et al., 1994</xref>). Another manifestation of this enhanced light sensitivity of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> is that these flies lose rhythmicity at an intensity of constant light too low to affect wt flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730413489797">Konopka, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748730413489797">Saunders et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we addressed the effects of PERS and used it as a tool to further understand the mechanism of light-mediated phase shifting and oscillator synchronization. The degradation rate of PERS is faster than that of PER, and PERS as well as PER is stabilized by TIM. This is true not only in flies, as previously shown, but also in tissue culture. A similar distinction takes place after a light pulse in clock neurons; that is, PERS disappeared faster than PER. This explains the previously described, dramatically different PRCs of wt and <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies. The data indicate that PER degradation dictates qualitative as well as quantitative features of light-mediated phase-resetting and oscillator entrainment and should be added to the classical cell-autonomous phase-resetting model.</p>

<title>PERS Degradation Is More Rapid Than PER and Is Inhibited by TIM</title>
<p>Previous work has shown that the mRNA levels of the cycling genes <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> accumulate earlier in <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> than in wt flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730413489797">Hardin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730413489797">Marrus et al., 1996</xref>). We observed essentially identical early accumulation of <italic>tim</italic> pre-mRNA (data not shown), consistent with the expectation that the phase of clock gene mRNA cycling is predominantly transcriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748730413489797">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). Because PER is a critical repressor of CLK-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730413489797">Allada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748730413489797">Takahashi, 2004</xref>), it is possible that this earlier transcription rise is due to a more rapid turnover of PERS relative to PER in the late night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730413489797">Marrus et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, expression and turnover occur concurrently, making it difficult to measure definitively the relative turnover rates in vivo. To address this issue, we expressed both PER and PERS in S2 cells under the control of a heat-shock promoter. Following transcriptional activation by heat shock, the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) was added, and PER and PERS levels were then determined over a time course of 6 h with anti-PER Western blots.</p>

<p>PERS decreased dramatically within the first 2 h after addition of CHX. The half-life of PERS is about 4 h shorter than that of PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating that the stability of PERS is substantially lower than that of PER in this system. In flies, TIM forms a very stable heterodimeric complex with PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748730413489797">Zeng et al., 1996</xref>) and also appears to stabilize PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730413489797">Ko et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730413489797">Nawathean and Rosbash, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730413489797">Price et al., 1995</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the difference in apparent degradation rate between PER and PERS is only detectable after about ZT18, a time in the night when TIM starts to disappear during a normal circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730413489797">Meyer et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">B</xref>).

<p>To determine whether TIM can affect the degradation of PERS in the S2 cell system, we co-expressed a heat shock-inducible TIM with PER or PERS, and the degradation rates were assayed by Western blot as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1D</xref>). The presence of TIM substantially extended the half-lives of PERS as well as PER. TIM appeared to affect the 2 proteins similarly, as neither one decreased significantly until 6 h after the addition of CHX.</p>
<p>We also verified that TIM interacts directly with PER/PERS in S2 cells. TIM and V5 tagged PER or PERS were expressed, PER/PERS was immunoprecipitated (IP) by anti-V5, and TIM was detected by Western blotting with an anti-TIM antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1E</xref>). The association of PER/PERS and TIM occurred rapidly, within 2 h of expression, and there was no noticeable difference between PER-TIM and PERS-TIM complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Rapid Turnover of PERS in Clock Neurons Following a Light Pulse at ZT18</title>
<p>Light-induced phase shifting is linked to clock protein degradation. The current paradigm begins with a light-induced conformational change of CRY. This triggers CRY-mediated degradation of TIM, and the rhythm phase is then either delayed or advanced. The phase changes after light pulses at different circadian times are represented by a phase-response curve (PRC). It is characterized in wt flies by a Type 1 PRC, which has modest delays and advances as well as a substantial crossover region (little or no phase shift) in the middle of the night between the delays and advance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413489797">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>PERS causes a Type 0 light pulse PRC. A 10-min light pulse was delivered to the entrained flies at the indicated times during the night. The phase shift caused by the light pulse is shown as spots. The blue trend line indicates a Type 1 curve for wt flies, which has a gradual shift between the delay and advance zones. The <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies have a Type 0 curve (red), which suddenly switches from the delay zone to the advance zone. The <italic>per<sup>01</sup>, elav::per<sup>S</sup>9M</italic> flies also have a Type 0 curve (green).

<p>Some strains like <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> have a discontinuity PRC (also called Type 0 PRC), with more dramatic delays and advances as well as the absence of this distinct crossover region in the middle of the night; these PRCs have an abrupt shift from prominent delays to prominent advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730413489797">Konopka, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748730413489797">Saunders et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413489797">Fig. 2</xref>). A Type 0 PRC is also characteristic of the short period <italic>doubletime<sup>S</sup></italic> strain, which like <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> undergoes more rapid PER degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730413489797">Bao et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> flies rescued by <italic>elav-</italic>driven UAS-<italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> (<italic>per<sup>01</sup>, elav::per<sup>S</sup>9M</italic>) also have a Type 0 PRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413489797">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that it is likely due to the shorter half-life of PERS relative to PER rather than any transcriptional features of the gene. In <italic>per<sup>01</sup>, elav::per<sup>S</sup>9M</italic> flies, the delay-advance crossover point is also about 2 h delayed compared with <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies, which presumably reflects the approximately 2 h longer period of <italic>per<sup>01</sup>, elav::per<sup>S</sup>9M</italic> flies compared with <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies. Although different periods in <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> and wt flies might affect the time of crossover in their PRCs, this experiment was performed to determine what type of PRC (0 v. 1) they displayed. The data suggest that the PRC is influenced by PER degradation as well as CRY-mediated degradation of TIM.</p>
<p>The difference between the wt PRC and the <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> PRC is most dramatic at ZT18 in the middle of the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413489797">Fig. 2</xref>). As mentioned above, it is notable that ZT18 is the starting point of spontaneous TIM degradation as assayed biochemically in both wt and <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> fly head extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, PERS is more unstable than PER without TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1C</xref>), and a 10-min light pulse is known to cause rapid TIM degradation in circadian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730413489797">Hunter-Ensor et al., 1996</xref>), especially in the late night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0748730413489797">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). This predicts that there might be a difference in PERS v. PER degradation within circadian neurons subsequent to a light pulse.</p>
<p>To address this possibility, we assayed the effect of a 10-min ZT18 light pulse on PER and PERS levels as well as TIM levels by immunohistochemistry within PDF-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730413489797">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730413489797">4</xref>). One hour later at ZT19, PER levels in wt flies were not noticeably reduced compared with the no-light pulse control; this was also the case even 4 h after the light pulse, at ZT22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730413489797">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730413489797">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730413489797">B</xref>). In contrast, PERS levels were dramatically lower 1 h after the light pulse, even less than those detected at ZT1 under standard LD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730413489797">Fig. 3B</xref>). TIM levels were reduced similarly in both genotypes and to a lesser extent than PERS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730413489797">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730413489797">4B</xref>). The most obvious TIM degradation occurred in nuclei, where PER and/or TIM contributes to transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730413489797">Darlington et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730413489797">Nawathean and Rosbash, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748730413489797">Saez and Young, 1996</xref>). The dramatic difference in PER v. PERS disappearance after a ZT18 light pulse is almost certainly relevant to the huge phase advance of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies at this time relative to virtually no phase shift of wt flies.</p>

In contrast to the ZT18 light pulse result, PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730413489797">Fig. 5A</xref>) as well as TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730413489797">Fig. 5B</xref>) has similar levels in the 2 genotypes 1 h after this light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730413489797">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730413489797">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730413489797">D</xref>).

<p>A prediction of this PER degradation view is that a light pulse will only trigger a decrease in PERS in <italic>per</italic>/<italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> heterozygous flies during the middle of the night period. This is because the substantial residual levels of wt PER after the light pulse should minimize the magnitude of the phase shift. The result shows that the <italic>per</italic>/<italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> heterozygous strain has a Type 1 PRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413489797">Fig. 2</xref>) with almost no phase shift at ZT18. This indicates that the PRC effect of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> is recessive and suggests that residual PER levels after the light pulse indeed determine the magnitude of the phase shift. As the free-running period of this heterozygous strain is 21.3 h (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748730413489797">Table 1</xref>), it suggests that the Type 0 PRC of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies is not attributable to the short period or the advanced phase of the molecular cycles. The data further suggest that PER multimers do not play an important role in light-induced PER turnover (see Discussion).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here that PER is stabilized by TIM in tissue culture cells as well as in flies and that PER degradation occurs subsequent to TIM degradation. Importantly, the degradation rate of PERS is more pronounced than that of wild-type PER, both in tissue culture cells and following a light pulse in clock neurons. The results explain the previously described, dramatically different phase response curves of wt and <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies. PER degradation rates therefore dictate qualitative as well as quantitative features of light-mediated phase-resetting and should be added to the standard cell-autonomous model of <italic>Drosophila</italic> phase shifting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0748730413489797">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<label>Figure 6.</label>
<caption><p>Current model to explain light-induced PRC. The current model to explain light pulse phase responses focuses on the degradation of TIM. The cycling of TIM occurs predominantly at night and includes 2 steps: climbing the slope (accumulation) and descending the slope on the other side (degradation). A light pulse causes the process to rapidly fall off the slope to trough levels. In the early night the process will restart from the beginning, which causes the delay, whereas in the late night the process will continue to the next cycle, thereby advancing the phase (A). Given this model, a plot of the change in phase, the PRC curve, will be Type 0 (B). To date, this type of PRC is only found in mutants that cause unstable PER (<italic>per<sup>S</sup>, doubletime<sup>S</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730413489797">Bao et al., 2001</xref>] and <italic>per<sup>01</sup>, elav::per<sup>S</sup></italic>), so we speculate that the process affected by the light pulse is PER degradation. Between ZT17 and ZT18, TIM is degraded by the light pulse, releasing PER for subsequent degradation. Since the degradation rate of PERS is faster than that of PER, at ZT17 PERS levels decrease to normal ZT12 levels and the clock is delayed. At ZT18, PERS is also degraded faster, which causes the accumulated PERS pool to decrease more quickly such that it resembles wt PER levels several hours later, which allows the clock to advance. For wt flies, PER cannot achieve the level of ZT12 or ZT24, so the flies only achieve a mild shift.</p></caption>

<p>The earlier start of mRNA cycling and earlier disappearance of PERS protein had suggested that the half-life of PERS is shorter than that of wild-type PER and responsible for earlier transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730413489797">Marrus et al., 1996</xref>). Because transcription had not been directly measured, and because PER synthesis and degradation do not occur at completely distinct phases of the circadian cycle, we turned to tissue culture cells in which the start point of protein degradation can be precisely determined. PERS indeed turns over more rapidly in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1C</xref>). This more rapid degradation then inspired an assay in flies using constitutive overexpression of PERS. It had been shown that constitutively expressed PER can endow <italic>per</italic> null flies with an approximately 24-h rhythm, indicating that cycling <italic>per</italic> transcription is not necessary for rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730413489797">Cheng and Hardin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0748730413489797">Yang and Sehgal, 2001</xref>).

The driver <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> is pan-neuronal and believed to promote constitutive gene expression with no relationship to the molecular clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730413489797">Robinow and White, 1988</xref>), and overexpression of UAS<italic>-per<sup>S</sup></italic> with this driver also gives rise to a short period phenotype. We suspect that TIM levels and therefore the cycling of TIM are limiting for PER levels. This is because PERS becomes unstable as TIM levels decrease. So PERS cannot accumulate even when overexpressed. This makes more rapid PERS degradation an even more likely explanation for the short period phenotype of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies. Presumably other transcriptional targets of circadian feedback are sufficient for near normal rhythmicity.</p>
<p>The S2 cell experiments also showed that the well-described PER-TIM interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748730413489797">Zeng et al., 1996</xref>) can stabilize PERS as well as PER in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1D</xref>). This result explains why the different degradation rates of PER and PERS are apparent in fly head extracts only after TIM begins to disappears at ZT18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413489797">B</xref>). As this is a time of maximal difference between the PRCs of wt and <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies, we suspected that the very rapid TIM degradation subsequent to a light pulse might unmask the difference between PER and PERS degradation. Consistent with an important contribution of PER degradation to light-mediated phase shifting is the Type 0 PRC of the UAS-<italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic>-rescued <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> flies, which is very similar to the <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> PRC and completely different from a wt Type 1 PRC.</p>
<p>Although a light pulse causes a similar decrease in TIM staining in wt and <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> central clock neurons at ZT18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730413489797">Fig. 4</xref>), PER staining was dramatically different in the 2 genotypes: It was stable in wt flies but rapidly decreased in <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies after a light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730413489797">Fig. 3</xref>). We therefore conclude that the magnitude of PER degradation can determine quantitative as well as qualitative features of light-mediated phase shifting, including the Type 1 and Type 0 PRCs of wt and <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> genotypes, respectively. It is notable that PERS is also more sensitive to low levels of constant light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730413489797">Konopka et al., 1989</xref>), suggesting that the lengthened periods of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies under these conditions are due to decreased PERS levels.</p>
<p>A subsequent immunostaining experiment was done at ZT21, when a light pulse causes a similar modest phase advance in both wt and <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413489797">Fig. 2</xref>). At this time, both PER and PERS staining decreases to a similar extent 1 h after the ZT21 light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730413489797">Fig. 5</xref>). Perhaps the accumulating PER modifications during the night endow the wt protein with a faster degradation rate subsequent to light-mediated TIM degradation at ZT21 than at ZT18. Alternatively, the major difference between PERS and PER degradation may occur earlier in the night. By ZT21, light-mediated degradation of residual PERS may be similar to light-mediated degradation of PER.</p>
<p>The cell-autonomous model of light-mediated phase shifting and its sole reliance on TIM degradation has changed only modestly since it was introduced in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730413489797">Ceriani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730413489797">Hunter-Ensor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730413489797">Koh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730413489797">Myers et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730413489797">Peschel et al., 2009</xref>). The early night is the accumulation phase of the PER-TIM cycle, so light-mediated TIM degradation at these times sets back this accumulation and therefore leads to phase delays. For example, the approximate 3-h phase delay caused by a light pulse at ZT15 sets back the circadian program to roughly ZT12. The late night is the decreasing or degradation phase of the PER-TIM cycle, so a light pulse at this time causes premature or more pronounced degradation and advances the cycle. The magnitude of the phase shifts caused by late night light pulses suggests that they advance the circadian program to the expected lights-on time of ZT0 or that they mimic premature dawn. Therefore, advances as well as delays appear to shift the clock to the 2 light transitions, lights-on (dawn) and lights-off (dusk), respectively. The fact that the early night phase delays and the late night phase advances of <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> are quasi-normal despite the enhanced PERS degradation further suggests that ZT12 and ZT0 are important stopping points for the clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413489797">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730413489797">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>It is notable that these 2 times are still relevant when <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> flies experience light pulses in the middle of the night. Indeed, our results also offer a partial explanation for the crossover region of a normal Type 1 PRC, the time in the middle of the night when a light pulse causes little or no phase shift of wt flies. This region of the PRC is much more responsive in <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic>, indicating that the enhanced degradation rate of PERS can transition the PER-TIM program more dramatically, up to 6 h from the crossover point back to ZT12 and forward to ZT0. However, the crossover region of a wt Type 1 PRC, the transition point between delays and advances, still awaits a cogent explanation. It is likely that features of the fly brain circadian network are relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748730413489797">Stoleru et al., 2007</xref>); that is, the cell-autonomous model may be insufficient to explain this feature of <italic>Drosophila</italic> light-mediated phase shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0748730413489797">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). For this reason, most of our analyses were restricted to the phase advance region. It may be more cell-autonomous than the phase delay region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0748730413489797">Tang et al., 2010</xref>), making the immunohistochemistry focus on PDF cells more relevant to the resulting phase shifts.</p>
<p>A recent study on the crystal structure of PER showed that PER can form PER-PER homodimers via their PAS domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748730413489797">Yildiz et al., 2005</xref>). Interrupting this dimerization with mutations within this domain dramatically inhibits these molecular interactions as well as behavioral rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730413489797">Landskron et al., 2009</xref>). This indicates that PER dimerization may contribute to the molecular clockworks. Unfortunately, the study did not address the region surrounding the <italic>per<sup>S</sup></italic> serine 589. Although this mutation may therefore affect PER dimerization, we show here that <italic>per/per<sup>S</sup></italic> heterozygous flies have a Type 1 PRC despite a free-running period of 21.3 h. This continuous PRC suggests that substantial PER levels must remain after the light pulse despite relevant PER-PER dimers in the heterozygous fly, that is, PER-PER, PERS-PERS, and PER-PERS.</p>
<p>It is still unclear what accounts for the enhanced degradation rates of PERS compared with PER, especially after a light pulse at ZT18 within PDF cells. Possibly relevant is the advance of the time-dependent phosphorylation events that occur on PERS relative to PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730413489797">Chiu et al., 2011</xref>). In this view, light simply unmasks PER and PERS by causing TIM degradation.</p>

<abstract>
<p>In the epilogue to this special issue, a hierarchical antagonistic process model is offered as a collective framework to explain the antecedents and consequences of verbal aggression described in the five preceding articles. The model proposes that the general traits of motivation to argue and verbal aggressiveness are second-order factors exerting top-down influence on more statelike subsidiary motives and attitudes. A test of the model (<italic>N</italic> = 743) found support for the proposed four-step process: Argumentation training increased motivation to argue, motivation to argue increased ability to argue, ability to argue increased self-esteem, and self-esteem decreased verbal aggressiveness. However, the indirect negative effect of motivation to argue on verbal aggressiveness was offset by a much larger direct positive effect. Belief systems theory was used to identify potential mediators of this positive effect and to explain other aspects of the verbal aggression process.</p>

<p>The surge in research on verbal aggression reflects an acknowledged necessity to manage this vital social problem. Most aggressive language can be traced back to the stressors that trigger hostility, where hostility drives destructive word choice. The first four studies in this special issue explore how stress induces verbal aggression. Underlying conflict between cultures motives genocidal language (Donohue, this issue), political tension between major parties leads to legislative bickering (Bull &amp; Wells, this issue), parental verbal aggression fuels the verbal aggressiveness of their children, in part by fostering hostility (Tafoya &amp; Hamilton, this issue), and distressing situations elicit rude language between strangers (Ickes et al., this issue). By contrast, the final study of this special issue and this epilogue concern an intervention that is purported to <italic>inhibit</italic> verbal aggression. This intervention entails the motivation and ability to argue. The program of research that advocates this intervention, falling under the banner of argumentativeness theory, has been criticized on methodological grounds (Levine, Kotowski, Beatty, &amp; Van Kelegom, this issue) and substantive grounds (this epilogue).</p>
<p>Argumentativeness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X11425038">Rancer, Kosberg, &amp; Silvestri, 1992</xref>) proposes that argumentation training increases argumentativeness, argumentativeness decreases verbal aggressiveness, and verbal aggressiveness increases verbal and physical aggression. The most immediate cause of verbal aggression, then, should be verbal aggressiveness. The intention to verbally aggress is a specific type of attitude known as a behavioral intention. Levine et al. (this issue) establish that among the few studies linking verbal aggressiveness to observed verbal aggression, the correlation is small at best. Their finding calls into question the predictive validity of the Verbal Aggressiveness Scale (VAS). Several explanations for the weak link between verbal aggressiveness and verbal aggression have been offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X11425038">Infante, Rancer, &amp; Wigley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X11425038">Kotowski, Levine, Baker, &amp; Bolt, 2009</xref>; Levine et al., this issue). It may be that the constraints imposed on behavior by experimental settings discourage verbal aggression from all but the most belligerent individuals. New studies should be conducted in naturalistic surroundings, away from university laboratories, to determine if the victims of aggressive language may be more willing to escalate conflict with invectives. One important question for future researchers is to determine the effect of a more general attitude toward verbal aggression on verbally aggressive behavior. Perhaps a more general attitude will show a stronger correlation with verbally aggressive behavior than the more specific intention to verbally aggress, as indicated by VAS scores.</p>

<title>Competing Models</title>
<p>Argumentativeness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X11425038">Infante, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X11425038">Rancer &amp; Avtgis, 2006</xref>) has few equals as an impetus for empirical research in the field of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1996</xref>). The theory revolves around the key concepts of <italic>argumentativeness</italic> and <italic>verbal aggressiveness</italic> and the scales that measure them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425038">Blickle, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X11425038">Blickle, Habasch, &amp; Senft, 1998</xref>). The two concepts have been used in hundreds of studies, although the construct validity and predictive validity of their measures have been assiduously questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X11425038">Beatty, Rudd, &amp; Valencic, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X11425038">Boster &amp; Levine, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X11425038">Boster, Levine, &amp; Kazoleas, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X11425038">Chory-Assad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X11425038">Dowling &amp; Flint, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425038">Hamilton, Buck, &amp; Chory-Assad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X11425038">Levine, Beatty, &amp; Limon, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The premises of argumentativeness theory have been largely derived in a variable analytical fashion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1996</xref>) rather than through deductive-nomological explanation. As a consequence, the propositions of the theory do not necessarily show logical consistency. Indeed, the theory contains fundamental contradictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>; Levine et al., this issue). The conflicting propositions have given rise to competing models and vigorous debate. The deficient argumentative skill (DAS) model represents argumentativeness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X11425038">Infante, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425038">Infante, Chandler, &amp; Rudd, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X11425038">Infante, Trebing, Shepherd, &amp; Seeds, 1984</xref>). The hierarchical antagonistic process (HAP) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>) represents belief systems theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X11425038">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X11425038">Rokeach, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X11425038">1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261927X11425038">1968</xref>). The debate on theory has turned on three main issues. First, what are the psychological underpinnings of the two models? Second, what is the dimensionality of the argumentativeness and verbal aggressiveness scales? Third, how do the two scales relate to similar constructs and to aggressive behavior?</p>

<title>The Deficient Argumentative Skill Model</title>
<p>The DAS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982</xref>) proposes that the motivation to approach arguments (ARGap) is independent of the motivation to avoid arguments (ARGav). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante and Rancer (1982)</xref> reported that ARGap and ARGav were uncorrelated (<italic>r</italic> = .07) as evidence for their proposition. To account for this independence between motives, the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X11425038">Infante et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982</xref>) drew heavily on the achievement motivation theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425038">Atkinson (1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425038">1974)</xref>. Steeped in the tradition of the fantasy analytic Thematic Apperception Test of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261927X11425038">McClelland, Atkinson, Clark, and Lowell (1953)</xref>, achievement motivation theory claims that approach and avoidance motives are independent. The Thematic Apperception Test is used to measure need for achievement (nAch), which is supposed to be uncorrelated with test anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425038">Atkinson, 1964</xref>). In achievement motivation theory, nAch scores and test anxiety scores are used to predict a person’s performance on task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425038">Atkinson, 1964</xref>). Within the DAS model, nAch corresponds to ARGap and test anxiety corresponds to ARGav.</p>

<title>The Dimensionality of the Argumentativeness Scale and VAS</title>
<p>Like achievement motivation theory, the DAS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982</xref>) claims that the independently operating motives can be used to predict performance. The DAS model does this by subtracting ARGav scores from ARGap scores. Unlike achievement motivation theory, however, the DAS model proposes that the independent motives are components of a more general trait. Specifically, ARGap and ARGav are subordinate to general trait motivation to argue (ARGgt).</p>
<p>The DAS model claims that verbal aggressiveness is a general predisposition that does not consist of subordinate structures, although the VAS has been shown to consist of two factors that represent positively worded and negatively worded items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>). Thus, the difference between the positive and negative wording in the VAS items is assumed to be an artifact rather than a conceptual difference between the two sets of items (see Levine et al., this issue, for a larger discussion on VAS artifacts).</p>

<title>Antecedents and Consequences</title>
<p>The DAS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261927X11425038">Infante et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X11425038">Rancer, Avtgis, Kosberg, &amp; Whitecap, 2000</xref>) contains four main propositions. First, argumentation training is supposed to increase argumentativeness. The size of this effect depends on both the duration and the quality of the training program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261927X11425038">Rancer, Whitecap, Kosberg, &amp; Avtgis, 1997</xref>). The effect of argumentation training on ARGgt for short and weak instruction shows small effects (ρ = .07), but long and strong instruction shows very large effects (ρ = .66). Second, male sex is supposed to increase both argumentativeness and verbal aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1996</xref>). Meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>) indicates that male sex does indeed increase ARGgt (<italic>r</italic> = .15) and general trait verbal aggressiveness (VAGgt; ρ = .13).</p>
<p>Third, the overall effect of argumentativeness on verbal aggressiveness is supposed to be negative, a claim that has been uncontrovertibly refuted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>). Argumentativeness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X11425038">Rancer et al., 1992</xref>) proposed that ARGgt would increase <italic>confidence in argumentative skill</italic>, a variable that is conceptually similar to self-perceived <italic>ability to argue</italic>. In turn, the theory posits that <italic>confidence in argumentative skill</italic> should increase self-esteem, with self-esteem decreasing VAGgt. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton and Mineo (2002)</xref> found support for these argumentativeness theory claims, estimating that <italic>confidence in argumentative skill</italic> increases self-esteem by .56, with self-esteem decreasing verbal aggressiveness by −.09, but they also found that a direct positive effect of ARGgt on VAGgt that overwhelmed the small inhibitory effect mediated by <italic>ability to argue</italic> and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Fourth, VAGgt is supposed to increase aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>). Attitude toward verbal aggression should increase acts of both verbal aggression and physical aggression. Meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>) indicates that VAGgt increases physical aggression (<italic>r<sub>M</sub></italic> = .48, <italic>SD</italic>ρ = .12), although the amount of variation across studies was large.</p>

<title>The Hierarchical Antagonistic Process Model</title>
<p>The HAP model is partly based on latent trait theories of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X11425038">Allport, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X11425038">Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X11425038">Briggs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425038">Cattell, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X11425038">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261927X11425038">Thurstone, 1934</xref>). A latent trait is the source of surface traits that are more specific to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X11425038">Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425038">Cattell, 1950</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X11425038">1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X11425038">Saulsman &amp; Page, 2004</xref>). The model proposes that the individualistic affect system and the cooperative affect system produce affect-specific variation in responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>). Superstructures within the hierarchy exert top-down influence on substructures that are more statelike and affect specific, characterized as having less inertia, having more sensitivity to situational pressure, and being closer to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425038">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>). The proposed HAP model found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425038">Figure 1</xref> contains path coefficients obtained from earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Hierarchical Structures</title>
<p>On motivation to argue, the general trait (ARGgt) influences the subsidiary motives of ARGap and ARGav. That is, scores on the first-order factors ARGap and ARGav would indicate smaller facets of personality, whereas scores on the second-order factor of ARGgt would indicate the more global source traits. Scores on ARGgt are computed as the sum of the set of subordinate ARGap and ARGav scores, where the strength of relationship between ARGgt and its facets ARGap and ARGav is indicated by the respective part–whole correlations. Similarly, the global attitude toward verbal aggression influences the subsidiary attitudes of verbal destructiveness and verbal collaborativeness. ARGap and verbal destructiveness scores manifest the “dark side” selfish emotions of the individualistic affect system, whereas ARGav and verbal collaborativeness scores manifest the “light side” prosocial emotions of the cooperative affect system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Motivation to argue</title>
<p>A meta-analysis that summarized decades of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>) indicated that the .07 value reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante and Rancer (1982)</xref> was more than six standard deviations away from the correlation obtained by all other researchers (<italic>r<sub>M</sub></italic> = −.41). The substantial negative correlation observed between ARGap and ARGav, coupled with a pattern of parallel, externally consistent correlations with other constructs led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton and Mineo (2002)</xref> to conclude that the results across studies support the existence of the second-order factor ARGgt.</p>
<p>Yet the claim of independent motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982</xref>) clashes with the claim that a second-order factor, ARGgt, exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>). The substantial negative correlation between ARGap and ARGav (<italic>r</italic> = −.41) cannot be reconciled with the DAS model claim that approach and avoid motives are independent. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425038">Blickle (1995)</xref> noted, achievement motivation theory does not provide a valid explanatory mechanism for the observed negative correlation between ARGap and ARGav. The HAP model, by contrast, does provide an explanation for the observed negative correlation: ARGgt increases ARGap (ρ = .87) and decreases ARGav (ρ = −.89), accounting for much of the spurious correlation between the two subsidiary motives. The HAP model proposes that ARGap and ARGav are “causally independent” of one another in that ARGap does not influence ARGav or vice versa.</p>

<title>Emotional involvement with arguing</title>
<p>Emotional involvement with arguing (ARGei) is calculated as the sum of the ARGap and ARGav subscales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>). Those who score low on ARGei are “apathetic” in that their motives are emotionally ambiguous and undifferentiated. They do not care enough to either approach or avoid arguments. Those who score high on ARGei are “conflicted” in that their motives are emotionally ambivalent; the prospect of arguing arouses them. They are torn between the need to approach and avoid arguing. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425038">Figure 1</xref> proposes that ARGei increases ARGap (ρ = .52) and ARGav (ρ = .50).</p>
<p>ARGei cannot, unfortunately, be used in conjunction with its two subsidiary motives to predict criterion variables such as self-esteem, which is supposed to mediate the effect of motivation to argue on verbal aggressiveness. Either ARGei or ARGap and ARGav must be used because ARGei is perfectly colinear with its subsidiary motives. With the trait–state distinction in mind, ARGgt and ARGei should better predict other personality traits (e.g., self-esteem), whereas ARGap and ARGav should better predict situation-specific arguing behavior (e.g., the extent to which people argue when placed in a context that encourages them to do so).</p>

The VAS was intended to be unidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>). However, the VAS was found to contain two subscales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X11425038">Chory-Assad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X11425038">Levine et al., 2004</xref>). Meta-analytic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X11425038">Hamilton, Buck, Chory, Beatty, &amp; Patrylak, 2008</xref>) indicate that the <italic>verbal destructiveness</italic> and <italic>verbal collaborativeness</italic> subscales have a strong negative correlation (<italic>r</italic> = −.53). The hierarchical model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425038">Figure 1</xref> provides an explanation for that observed negative correlation: VAGgt increases <italic>verbal destructiveness</italic> (ρ = .77) and <italic>verbal collaborativeness</italic> (ρ = −.85), which explains a large portion of the spurious correlation between the two subsidiary attitudes.</p>
<p>Aggression is intentional behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X11425038">Geen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261927X11425038">Zillman, 1979</xref>) that can take the form of damage to victims (assault) or their property (indirect aggression). VAGgt measures general attitude toward verbal aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X11425038">Levine et al., 2004</xref>), so it should show a strong correlation with general measures of aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X11425038">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X11425038">Kim &amp; Hunter, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X11425038">1993b</xref>). The behavioral alternative to aggression is affection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261927X11425038">Walters, Pearce, &amp; Dahms, 1957</xref>), so the HAP model posits that behavioral measures (from physical aggression to affection) should correlate more highly with the statelike <italic>verbal destructiveness</italic> and <italic>verbal collaborativeness</italic> measures than with VAGgt (see the curved arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425038">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Verbal engagement in conflict</title>
<p>Emotional involvement during an exchange of opinions can generate both destructive and collaborative utterances. Opinionated language in the midst of such exchanges can be expressed as the acceptance or rejection of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X11425038">Rokeach, 1956</xref>). The tendency to be more involved in opinionated exchanges, as opposed to withdrawing from them, can be conceptualized as <italic>verbal engagement in conflict (VEC)</italic>. Estimating this involvement as VEC entails summing scores on the <italic>verbal destructiveness</italic> and <italic>verbal collaborativeness</italic> subscales (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425038">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>). Those who score low on VEC are “apathetic” in that they are withdrawn from conversations. Their attitudes are characterized by a disinterest in verbal behavior—both destructive and collaborative. <italic>Involved moderates</italic> were high on VEC, scoring high on destructiveness and high on collaborativeness. Their attitudes are characterized by higher verbal output, with the intention to employ destructive or collaborative utterances. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X11425038">Figure 1</xref> proposes that VEC increases both verbal destructiveness (ρ = .56) and verbal collaborativeness (ρ = .62).</p>
<p>VEC cannot, unfortunately, be used in conjunction with its two subsidiary attitudes to predict behavior. Either VEC or verbal destructiveness and verbal collaborativeness must be used because VEC is perfectly colinear with its subsidiary attitudes. The global-specific distinction within attitude hierarchies suggests that verbal destructiveness and verbal collaborativeness should be better predictors of aggressive behavior than their overarching general trait, verbal aggressiveness.</p>
<p>The causal analysis presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton and Hample (2011)</xref> contained a small specification error. They had assumed that VAGgt would be independent of VEC. In fact, reanalysis of their correlation matrix indicates that VAGgt increases VEC (ρ = .11). That is, more verbally aggressive individuals are more inclined to be verbally engaged in conflict situations. The addition of this path in the model would eliminate the need for a direct path from male sex to VEC.</p>

<title>Antagonistic Processes</title>
<p>At the heart of DAS model is the proposed negative effect of ARGgt on VAGgt (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>). The two variables are supposed to be linked by a three-step inhibitory process in which (a) ARGgt increases <italic>ability to argue</italic>, (b) <italic>ability to argue</italic> increases self-esteem, and (c) self-esteem decreases VAGgt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X11425038">Rancer et al., 1992</xref>). More than a decade ago, argumentativeness theorists became aware that ARGgt actually increases VAGgt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425038">Infante et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261927X11425038">Rancer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X11425038">Rancer et al., 2000</xref>). In fact, the overall effect of ARGgt on VAGgt across studies remains positive even after ruling out third-variable explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The HAP model proposes that ARGgt has two opposing effects on VAGgt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>). As originally proposed by argumentativeness theory, there should a three-step inhibitory sequence in which ARGgt increases <italic>ability to argue</italic> (ρ = .48), <italic>ability to argue</italic> increases self-esteem (ρ = .39), and self-esteem decreases VAGgt (ρ = −.09). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425038">Figure 2</xref>, ARGgt may also have a small negative effect on self-esteem. If these predictions are accurate, then the indirect effect of ARGgt on VAGgt through this inhibitory sequence is slight. ARGgt should also have a “direct” positive effect on VAGgt (ρ = .27). Note that this positive effect is not predicted by the DAS model.</p>

They completed the 20-item argumentativeness scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982</xref>), the 20-item VAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>), a 10-item self-esteem scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261927X11425038">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>), 4 items related to argumentation training, and questions regarding their gender and age.</p>
<p>Sex was coded so that a higher score indicated male sex (male = 2, female = 1). The argumentativeness, verbal aggressiveness, and self-esteem items were presented in 5-interval Likert-type format.

<title>Scale Reliability</title>
<p>Consistent with recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425038">Blickle, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>), the 20 argumentativeness items were found to consist of three factors: ARGap, ARGav, and <italic>ability to argue</italic>. Three of the four motivation to argue measures showed good internal consistency: the 9-item ARGap scale (α = .83), the 9-item ARGav scale (α = .81), and the 18-item ARGgt scale (α = .87). The 18-item ARGei scale was marginally consistent (α = .60). The α reliability of the 2-item <italic>ability to argue</italic> scale was .69.The α reliability of the 4-item argumentation training scale was .75.</p>
<p>As in most studies of the VAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X11425038">Beatty et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X11425038">Chory-Assad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X11425038">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X11425038">Levine et al., 2004</xref>), the 20 items were found to consist of two factors: verbal destructiveness (negatively worded items) and verbal collaborativeness (positively worded items). Three of the four verbal aggressiveness measures showed good internal consistency: the 10-item verbal destructiveness scale (α = .81), the 10-item verbal collaborativeness scale (α = .78), the 20-item VAGgt scale (α = .86).

<title>Item Quality</title>
<p>The confirmatory analysis was conducted with CFA 2.0 (Hunter &amp; Hamilton, 2011). The three criteria employed to assess item quality were homogeneity of content, internal consistency, and external consistency. Internal consistency was measured with standard score coefficient α reliability. External consistency was measured with parallelism tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X11425038">Hunter, 1980</xref>). The parallelism tests yielded a root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) value for flatness (item quality is approximately equal) and gradient (item quality ranges from weak to strong).</p>
<p>The internal consistency and parallelism tests indicated that the ARGap, ARGav, verbal destructiveness, and verbal collaborativeness scales all formed strong to weak gradients. That is, the items on these scales varied significantly in quality. Consider internal consistency first. The RMSEA values on the flatness tests were noticeably larger than the standard accepted value of .08: .17 for ARGap, .17 for ARGav, .11 for verbal destructiveness, and .11 for verbal collaborativeness. By contrast, the RMSEA values on the gradient tests were near the standard accepted value of .08 or smaller: .07 for ARGap, .09 for ARGav, .06 for verbal destructiveness, and .07 for verbal collaborativeness. Now consider external consistency. The RMSEA value on the flatness tests were again large relative to the standard accepted value of .08: .10 for ARGap, .09 for ARGav, .06 for verbal destructiveness, and .06 for verbal collaborativeness. By contrast, the RMSEA value on the gradient tests were all at or below the standard accepted value of .08: .08 for ARGap, .08 for ARGav, .05 for verbal destructiveness, and .05 for verbal collaborativeness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The HAP model received much stronger empirical support in the current study than the DAS model. Both the hierarchical and the antagonistic processes components of the HAP model are necessary to provide a plausible account of meta-analytic and large-sample study findings. The HAP model has three main advantages over the DAS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>). First, the HAP model warrants the common practice of reporting ARGgt, ARGap, and ARGav scores and explains the lack of direct causal links between ARGap and ARGav. Second, the HAP model justifies the common practice of reporting total VAS scores as an indicator of VAGgt but only if authors also report the 10-item verbal destructiveness (positively worded items) and the 10-item verbal collaborativeness (negatively worded items) scores. Third, ARGei has large positive effects on ARGap and ARGav just as VEC has large positive effects on verbal destructiveness and verbal collaborativeness. ARGei and VEC allow the HAP model to accurately predict subsidiary motives and attitudes, whereas the DAS model cannot predict subsidiary motives and attitudes from ARGgt and VAGgt without massive error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the present study cast further doubt on the applicability of Anderson’s achievement motivation theory to argumentative phenomena. Although latent trait theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X11425038">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1988</xref>) accounts for the hierarchical structures in the HAP model, it provides little insight into the antagonistic processes proposed in the model. Belief systems theory (BST), on the other hand, has the potential to account for these opposing personality processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>). The two processes that BST can explain are the positive effect of ARGgt on VAGgt (as well as the parallel effect of ARGei on VEC) and the negative effect of self-esteem on verbal aggressiveness.</p>

<p>BST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X11425038">1999</xref>) proposes that personality is most deeply rooted in competencies of cognition and affect. This primary set of beliefs is concerned with conceptions of the physical world that yield perceptual and motor skills. These competencies include needs such as the motivation to argue. Developmentally, the self-concept follows from these competencies. This secondary set of beliefs is concerned with conceptions of self (including self-esteem), as well as reality testing (including empathy and egocentrism). The remaining aspect of personality to develop is temperament. This tertiary set of beliefs is concerned with conceptions of others. Temperament includes anxiety (e.g., fear of public speaking and small-group communication), hostility (resentment, irritability, and suspiciousness), and contentment. Beliefs formed earlier in this developmental progression have greater centrality and continue to exert influence on later formed beliefs long into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In BST, each of the three belief sets is organized teleologically. The end of the primary beliefs is action. Among these cognitive-affective competencies, aptitudes influence motivation, with motivation guiding activity. Applied to the HAP model, the general need to argue would give rise to the more actionable ARGap and ARGav. The end of the secondary beliefs is ego maintenance or sustaining the self-concept. Among these self-concept beliefs, identity influences self-worth with self-worth driving reality testing. Applied to the HAP model, male sex and self-esteem would influence egocentrism and empathy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425038">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X11425038">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>). The end of the tertiary beliefs is relationship maintenance. Among these conceptions of others, anxiety increases hostility, with hostility diminishing contentment. Applied to the HAP model, anxiety and hostility would mediate the effect of male sex and self-esteem on attitude toward verbal aggression.</p>

<title>Arguing, Verbally Aggressing, and Teleological Influence Within Belief Sets</title>
<p>Argumentation training entails learning an aptitude. ARGgt is a motivation influenced by that acquired aptitude, where argumentation training increases ARGgt (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425038">Figure 2</xref>). The subsidiary motives of ARGap and ARGav follow from ARGgt (ρ = .88 and −.85, respectively) and should be proximate determinants of arguing style.</p>
<p>Identity is defined by demographic variables such as age and ethnicity and most notably in the present study by sex. Self-worth encompasses the positive life events (achievements) that increase self-esteem and the negative life events (stressors) that foster depression and neuroticism. Societies tend to favor middle-aged men from ethnic majorities, so male sex should increase an achievement such as the <italic>ability to argue</italic>, although this effect is mediated by ARGgt. That is, male sex increases ARGgt (ρ = .15), with ARGgt increasing <italic>ability to argue</italic> (ρ = .48). The predicted indirect effect would be .08. Averaged across the two studies (the present one and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>) the effect of male sex on <italic>ability to argue</italic> is slightly positive—approximately .06.</p>
<p>Achievement increases self-esteem, although the size of this effect varies considerably across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>). This general achievement effect accounts for the specific effect that <italic>ability to argue</italic> has on self-esteem that was observed in the present study. Earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>) proposed that ARGgt has a direct negative effect on self-esteem (ρ = −.14), but the present study found no support for this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Reality testing is the propensity to check the goodness of fit between external reality and internal representations of that reality. In BST, two inversely related aspects of reality testing are <italic>egocentrism</italic> and <italic>empathy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X11425038">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>). Egocentrism is a self-absorption (narcissism in the extreme) characterized by an ego defensiveness associated with lax reality testing. By contrast, empathy is an orientation toward others associated with vigilant reality testing. Egocentrism triggers selfish emotions within the individualistic affect system, whereas empathy triggers prosocial emotions within the cooperative affect system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425038">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>). The positive effects of ARGgt on VAGgt and VEC proposed in the HAP model may be mediated by either egocentrism or empathy.</p>
<p>Anxiety increases hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X11425038">Hamilton, Tafoya, &amp; Veksler, 2011</xref>), with hostility decreasing contentment. Within BST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425038">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>), hostility is supposed to mediate the effect of egocentrism on verbal aggressiveness (or destructiveness) and contentment is supposed to mediate the effect of empathy on verbal collaborativeness. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261927X11425038">Figure 2</xref> portrays this mediation process, although these mediators were not measured in the present study.</p>

<title>Predicting Communicative Behavior in Conflict Situations</title>
<p>A reanalysis of data from two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X11425038">Chory-Assad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X11425038">Kotowski et al., 2009</xref>) indicates that the average effect of verbal collaborativeness on observed verbal aggression during conflict is small (<italic>r</italic> = −.10) with almost no variability. Neither VAS scores nor verbal destructiveness scores predicted observed verbal aggression in either study. This conclusion raises the possibility that verbal collaboration is as much related to the inhibition of selfish emotions as it is to prosocial emotions. As an attitude structure, verbal aggressiveness may consist of two subsidiary factors that form a Guttman Simplex. The milder form of verbal aggressiveness consists of a predisposition to destroy others, whereas the harsher form consists of a predisposition to be anticollaborative. Verbal aggressors who limit themselves to the milder form may still be willing to reach an accommodation (at least temporarily) with those they wish to devastate. Verbal aggressors who are willing to escalate to the harsher form are blithe about maintaining the relationship for subsequent civil discourse.</p>
<p>The debate over the predictive validity of the VAS scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X11425038">Infante et al., 2011</xref>; Levine et al., this issue) highlights the need for a program of research that accounts for observed verbal aggression in a variety of situations. Meta-analytic evidence indicates that attitude toward verbal aggression predicts recall of past verbal and physical aggression (<italic>r</italic> ≈ .50) much better than it predicts observed verbal aggression (<italic>r</italic> ≈ .10). As Levine et al. show, few studies have been conducted to determine the effect of verbal aggressiveness on observed verbal aggression. Hence, the reason the observed effect differs so markedly from the recall effect is unclear; a moderator analysis would require at least four or five more studies to detect a distinct pattern, much less provide compelling empirical support for it.</p>

<title>Future Research on Verbal Aggression</title>
<p>The HAP model reconciles many of the findings of argumentativeness theory advocates with those of its critics. The model allows researchers to interpret past findings using the VAS, although interpreting the results of studies using the argumentativeness scale should be done cautiously since it contains three distinct subscales (ARGap, ARGav, and <italic>ability to argue</italic>) that correlate differently with predictor and criterion variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X11425038">Blickle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Hample, 2011</xref>). For the time being, researchers should report ARGei and VEC scores as they seek to determine the correlates of these two variables. The low reliabilities of ARGei and VEC remain a concern, providing another reason to find improved measures that are not colinear with the sum of subsidiary motives and attitudes.</p>
<p>The present study strengthened the case for using BST to explain the antagonistic processes of the HAP model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425038">Hamilton &amp; Mineo, 2002</xref>). Verbal aggressiveness has long been a part of BST, in the form of opinionated rejection language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X11425038">Rokeach, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X11425038">1960</xref>). Those who engage in opinionated rejection language criticize their target based on their beliefs. The current study advanced the BST-grounded HAP model in three respects. First, the relative position of argumentation training and <italic>ability to argue</italic> within the causal flow were more clearly established. Second, trait verbal aggressiveness was shown to increase VEC. Third, general traits were more sharply distinguished from their more statelike subordinate motives and attitudes. Researchers should find that the situational sensitivity of subordinate structures means that these measures will show larger effects on aggressive, avoidant, and affectionate behavior than their superordinate general traits. Finally, the motivation to argue may fuel a portion of the verbal aggression described by the other studies in this special issue—inciting the use of genocidal language between ethnic groups, clever barbs between politicians, harsh words between family members, and rudeness between strangers. Combined with the results from those studies, the findings from the present research offer additional detail about the operation of the two antagonistic processes that influence verbal aggression.</p>

For the debate and logic items, participants were instructed to count a course as relevant only if its content was predominantly devoted to debate, logic, or critical thinking and not if these topics were only incidental to course content. Experiences that counted as “debate training” included classes in debate or participation in a competitive debate program. Experience that counted as logic training consisted of classes in formal or informal logic or critical thinking.</p></fn>

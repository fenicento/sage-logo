<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis predominantly affecting the large weight-bearing joints of the body such as the knee. Symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis include joint instability, pain on weight-bearing and/or at rest, reduced range of motion and disuse atrophy and weakness of the quadriceps femoris muscle. Functional disability arises from pain and loss of quadriceps femoris strength, both of which reduce quality of life and increase the risk of further morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511431902">1</xref></sup> Exercise therapy aims to decrease pain and increase quadriceps femoris strength, therefore improving functional capacity for those with knee osteoarthritis. The American College of Rheumatology has approved regular exercise as a therapeutic approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511431902">2</xref></sup> with both aerobic and strengthening exercises shown to improve pain and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511431902">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation consists of electrically stimulating muscle and/or nerves to induce a muscle contraction. It increases the load on the muscle using an electrically induced contraction and can therefore be used to improve muscle strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511431902">4</xref></sup> Evidence suggests that neuromuscular electrical stimulation can increase strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle and decreases pain in knee osteoarthritis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511431902">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511431902">6</xref></sup> however this has not been thoroughly investigated. A previous systematic review published in 2000 identified strong evidence for the beneficial application of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in knee osteoarthritis, however the authors highlighted limitations which included the limited number of included studies, their small sample sizes and flawed allocation procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511431902">7</xref></sup> In addition, patients post total knee arthroplasty were included as was the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for pain relief.</p>
<p>Because of the expansion of research in the area of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in the past decade, an update on the current evidence is required. Hence this study was undertaken to systematically review the literature to determine the efficacy of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation as a method of improving quadriceps femoris muscle strength, pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269215511431902" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The review comprised three phases. In phase 1 an extensive literature search of the following databases was conducted up to January 2011: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Sports Discus, PEDro and the Cochrane Library. The search terms relating to osteoarthritis and neuromuscular electrical stimulation used in the MEDLINE search were modified for the other databases (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0269215511431902">Appendix 1</xref>). Citation lists from all included studies were also searched.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials, published in English, or translated into English between 1986 and 2011, and conducted on human adults with a diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral knee joint osteoarthritis. Studies that used neuromuscular electrical stimulation in combination with any other therapeutic intervention or exercise programme, as well as those comparing neuromuscular electrical stimulation to exercise interventions/non-exercise interventions or combinations of exercise with different conservative treatments were included. Exclusion criteria included participants who had undergone total knee replacement or uni-compartmental replacement or had any history of inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. Studies that investigated the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or pulsed electromagnetic stimulation were also excluded, along with studies that used implantable electrodes.</p>
<p>In phase 2, two reviewers (OMG and GFC) assessed studies generated from the search strategy for inclusion using the title and/or the abstract if there was ambiguity in the study title. Full copies of potentially relevant studies were then obtained for detailed examination. The two reviewers then reviewed the full text of the potential studies to determine their suitability. Where disagreement existed between the reviewers on the inclusion of a study, a third independent reviewer (BMF) was assigned to review the manuscript. A detailed proforma was developed to capture and categorize the results of the included studies into three main themes: the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on pain, on function and on quadriceps femoris muscle strength.</p>
<p>In phase 3, the quality of the studies was assessed using the Thomas Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511431902">9</xref></sup> which has been identified in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511431902">8</xref></sup> as the most appropriate tool for quality assessment for studies involving both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Two reviewers (OMG and GFC) independently graded the quality of the included studies according to the following components: selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods, withdrawals and drop-outs. These component ratings then gave a global rating of strong, moderate or weak. The strength of the evidence was then graded according to the grading system used in the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCRP) guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511431902">8</xref></sup> Minor amendments were made to the grading system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511431902">9</xref></sup> to include level B category for trials of moderate quality. Where appropriate, study results were pooled and meta-analyses were undertaken. Considering the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies the meta-analyses were limited to studies where outcome measures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and function scores, and walking tests. The analysis was undertaken using Review Manager Software package RevMan 5 (version 5.0.25, updated 2010 Cochrane Collaboration). For the continuous data where different scales were employed by different studies for the assessment of the same outcome (e.g. walking test) the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effect model. Where the same scale was employed (e.g. for pain and function (WOMAC)), the mean differences with 95% CI were used. Authors were contacted in cases of incomplete data.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ten studies investigating the impact of neuromuscular stimulation in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the review. The quality of the studies was strong (<italic>n</italic> = 2), moderate (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or weak (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Overall there is inconsistent evidence (level D) that neuromuscular electrical stimulation significantly reduced pain and increased strength and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. However, the results of the pooled analyses from six studies found that neuromuscular electrical stimulation improved levels of self-reported pain and function, but not objective measures of function in this population. Nonetheless, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of studies and the low number of studies included as demonstrated by the <italic>I</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511431902">2</xref></sup> statistic.</p>
<p>The results of the present review should be considered with respect for the following limitations. Both randomized controlled trials and a controlled clinical trial were included in this review. While there is less agreement on critical appraisal tools for the evaluation of non-randomized studies, a valid and reliable tool previously used in systematic reviews (Thomas Test) rated the quality of the studies. In addition only studies published in English or translated into English were included, meaning that some studies may have been overlooked. The limited number of studies included in the meta-analyses due to study heterogeneity may also limit findings.</p>
<p>The development of treatment protocols for the management of symptoms (pain, reduced strength and function) in patients with knee osteoarthritis is important. It is estimated that 10% of people older than 55 years have symptoms of osteoarthritis, a quarter of whom are severely disabled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511431902">18</xref></sup> As a disease, osteoarthritis is now also being identified in adults at younger ages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511431902">19</xref></sup> thus if effective interventions are not developed, joint replacement surgery will be needed at earlier ages to maintain mobility and quality of life.</p>
<p>In the elderly population with knee osteoarthritis reduced quadriceps strength and increased postural sway have been reported, both of which may be related to falls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511431902">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511431902">21</xref></sup> Falls in the older population has been recognized as a significant health issue in today’s society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511431902">22</xref></sup> It is estimated that one in every three people over the age of 65 and one in two people over the age of 80 years fall every year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511431902">23</xref></sup> with fall-related injuries the leading cause of injury and disability among adults greater than 65 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511431902">24</xref></sup> Given the expected rise in the age of the population in Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511431902">25</xref></sup> developing protocols to maximize strength and proprioception in the lower extremity is important.</p>
<p>A previous systematic review has provided strong evidence demonstrating that conventional exercise has significant benefits in terms of knee pain and physical function in knee osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511431902">26</xref></sup> Neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been suggested as a method for increasing strength of the quadriceps femoris and decreasing pain in knee osteoarthritis, but findings to date have been inconclusive. The findings of the current review concur with the findings reported by Monaghan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511431902">4</xref></sup> who found that there was inconclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation as a means of improving quadriceps femoris strength in knee osteoarthritis patients both before and after total knee replacement. This review was very small with only two studies included, both with a high risk of methodological bias. Hulme et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511431902">27</xref></sup> also reported inconclusive findings in their review regarding the effects of pulsed electromagnetic stimulation in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Conversely, Marks and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511431902">7</xref></sup> suggested that there was strong evidence to support the application of neuromuscular electrical stimulation to strengthen the quadriceps femoris muscle; however, confidence in these conclusions is weakened by the limitations presented earlier.</p>
<p>The challenge of developing protocols for this patient cohort is that in the published literature there is no consistency in the neuromuscular electrical stimulation parameters used. In the current review six studies employed neuromuscular electrical stimulation at a frequency of 50 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511431902">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511431902">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511431902">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511431902">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511431902">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511431902">17</xref></sup> to produce smooth tetanic muscle contractions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431902">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511431902">28</xref></sup> a condition which is favourable for strengthening the quadriceps femoris muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511431902">29</xref></sup> However, a range of other frequencies were also included (25 Hz,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511431902">13</xref></sup> 30 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431902">10</xref></sup> and pulse patterns at a frequency of 8.4 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511431902">11</xref></sup>). In addition, parameters of pulse width versus duration and intensity showed great variability between studies: one paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511431902">5</xref></sup> applied stimulation at an intensity which produced quadricep femoris contractions at 10–40% of maximum voluntary contraction, while a second<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511431902">17</xref></sup> reported using stimulation intensities which produced at least 35% of maximum voluntary contraction. Further research is necessary to clearly establish the optimal neuromuscular electrical stimulation parameters for use in this population. In addition, standardizing cointerventions is warranted in the development of protocols for use in the clinical setting to maximize the impact of this intervention. In the current review the lack of consistency between studies makes this difficult: six studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511431902">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511431902"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511431902"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511431902"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511431902">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511431902">17</xref></sup> investigated the application of neuromuscular electrical stimulation alone, while a further four studies combined neuromuscular electrical stimulation with other therapeutic interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511431902">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511431902">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511431902">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511431902">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conflicting data from the studies identified in the current review does not allow any definitive conclusion to be made with regard to the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation to reduce pain and to increase quadriceps femoris strength and function in knee osteoarthritis. Nevertheless, the existing evidence is promising, with a greater number of moderate–strong quality randomized controlled trials suggesting the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in this population. In particular, neuromuscular electrical stimulation may prove to be a useful therapeutic alternative for individuals with knee osteoarthritis who are unable to carry out conventional exercise due to the presence of coexisting disease. Future studies in this field should be conducted to establish protocols using neuromuscular electrical stimulation to increase patient function, reduce pain and maximize quality of life.</p>
